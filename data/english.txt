In Which We Begin Not to Understand\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n It is not without a certain emotion that I begin to recount here the\r\n\r\n extraordinary adventures of Joseph Rouletabille. Down to the present time\r\n\r\n he had so firmly opposed my doing it that I had come to despair of ever\r\n\r\n publishing the most curious of police stories of the past fifteen years. I\r\n\r\n had even imagined that the public would never know the whole truth of the\r\n\r\n prodigious case known as that of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, out of which grew so\r\n\r\n many mysterious, cruel, and sensational dramas, with which my friend was\r\n\r\n so closely mixed up, if, propos of a recent nomination of the illustrious\r\n\r\n Stangerson to the grade of grandcross of the Legion of Honour, an evening\r\n\r\n journal\u2014in an article, miserable for its ignorance, or audacious for\r\n\r\n its perfidy\u2014had not resuscitated a terrible adventure of which\r\n\r\n Joseph Rouletabille had told me he wished to be for ever forgotten.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d! Who now remembers this affair which caused so much ink to\r\n\r\n flow fifteen years ago? Events are so quickly forgotten in Paris. Has not\r\n\r\n the very name of the Nayves trial and the tragic history of the death of\r\n\r\n little Menaldo passed out of mind? And yet the public attention was so\r\n\r\n deeply interested in the details of the trial that the occurrence of a\r\n\r\n ministerial crisis was completely unnoticed at the time. Now The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room trial, which, preceded that of the Nayves by some years, made far\r\n\r\n more noise. The entire world hung for months over this obscure problem\u2014the\r\n\r\n most obscure, it seems to me, that has ever challenged the perspicacity of\r\n\r\n our police or taxed the conscience of our judges. The solution of the\r\n\r\n problem baffled everybody who tried to find it. It was like a dramatic\r\n\r\n rebus with which old Europe and new America alike became fascinated.
That\r\n\r\n is, in truth\u2014I am permitted to say, because there cannot be any\r\n\r\n author\u2019s vanity in all this, since I do nothing more than transcribe facts\r\n\r\n on which an exceptional documentation enables me to throw a new light\u2014that\r\n\r\n is because, in truth, I do not know that, in the domain of reality or\r\n\r\n imagination, one can discover or recall to mind anything comparable, in\r\n\r\n its mystery, with the natural mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n That which nobody could find out, Joseph Rouletabille, aged eighteen, then\r\n\r\n a reporter engaged on a leading journal, succeeded in discovering. But\r\n\r\n when, at the Assize Court, he brought in the key to the whole case, he did\r\n\r\n not tell the whole truth. He only allowed so much of it to appear as\r\n\r\n sufficed to ensure the acquittal of an innocent man. The reasons which he\r\n\r\n had for his reticence no longer exist. Better still, the time has come for\r\n\r\n my friend to speak out fully. You are going to know all; and, without\r\n\r\n further preamble, I am going to place before your eyes the problem of The\r\n\r\n Yellow Room as it was placed before the eyes of the entire world on the\r\n\r\n day following the enactment of the drama at the Chateau du Glandier.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n On the 25th of October, 1892, the following note appeared in the latest\r\n\r\n edition of the \u201cTemps\u201d:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA frightful crime has been committed at the Glandier, on the border of\r\n\r\n the forest of Sainte-Genevieve, above Epinay-sur-Orge, at the house of\r\n\r\n Professor Stangerson. On that night, while the master was working in his\r\n\r\n laboratory, an attempt was made to assassinate Mademoiselle Stangerson,\r\n\r\n who was sleeping in a chamber adjoining this laboratory. The doctors do\r\n\r\n not answer for the life of Mdlle. Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The impression made on Paris by this news may be easily imagined. Already,\r\n\r\n at that time, the learned world was deeply interested in the labours of\r\n\r\n Professor Stangerson and his daughter. These labours\u2014the first that\r\n\r\n were attempted in radiography\u2014served to open the way for Monsieur\r\n\r\n and Madame Curie to the discovery of radium. It was expected the Professor\r\n\r\n would shortly read to the Academy of Sciences a sensational paper on his\r\n\r\n new theory,\u2014the Dissociation of Matter,\u2014a theory destined to\r\n\r\n overthrow from its base the whole of official science, which based itself\r\n\r\n on the principle of the Conservation of Energy. On the following day, the\r\n\r\n newspapers were full of the tragedy. The \u201cMatin,\u201d among others, published\r\n\r\n the following article, entitled: \u201cA Supernatural Crime\u201d:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThese are the only details,\u201d wrote the anonymous writer in the \u201cMatin\u201d\u2014\u201cwe\r\n\r\n have been able to obtain concerning the crime of the Chateau du Glandier.\r\n\r\n The state of despair in which Professor Stangerson is plunged, and the\r\n\r\n impossibility of getting any information from the lips of the victim, have\r\n\r\n rendered our investigations and those of justice so difficult that, at\r\n\r\n present, we cannot form the least idea of what has passed in The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room in which Mdlle. Stangerson, in her night-dress, was found lying on\r\n\r\n the floor in the agonies of death. We have, at least, been able to\r\n\r\n interview Daddy Jacques\u2014as he is called in the country\u2014a old\r\n\r\n servant in the Stangerson family. Daddy Jacques entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d at the\r\n\r\n same time as the Professor. This chamber adjoins the laboratory.\r\n\r\n Laboratory and Yellow Room are in a pavilion at the end of the park, about\r\n\r\n three hundred metres (a thousand feet) from the chateau.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018It was half-past twelve at night,\u2019 this honest old man told us, \u2018and I\r\n\r\n was in the laboratory, where Monsieur Stangerson was still working, when\r\n\r\n the thing happened. I had been cleaning and putting instruments in order\r\n\r\n all the evening and was waiting for Monsieur Stangerson to go to bed.\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson had worked with her father up to midnight; when\r\n\r\n the twelve strokes of midnight had sounded by the cuckoo-clock in the\r\n\r\n laboratory, she rose, kissed Monsieur Stangerson and bade him good-night.\r\n\r\n To me she said \u201cbon soir, Daddy Jacques\u201d as she passed into The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room. We heard her lock the door and shoot the bolt, so that I could not\r\n\r\n help laughing, and said to Monsieur: \u201cThere\u2019s Mademoiselle double-locking\r\n\r\n herself in,\u2014she must be afraid of the \u2018Bete du bon Dieu!\u2019\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n did not even hear me, he was so deeply absorbed in what he was doing. Just\r\n\r\n then we heard the distant miawing of a cat.
\u201cIs that going to keep us\r\n\r\n awake all night?\u201d I said to myself; for I must tell you, Monsieur, that,\r\n\r\n to the end of October, I live in an attic of the pavilion over The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room, so that Mademoiselle should not be left alone through the night in\r\n\r\n the lonely park. It was the fancy of Mademoiselle to spend the fine\r\n\r\n weather in the pavilion; no doubt, she found it more cheerful than the\r\n\r\n chateau and, for the four years it had been built, she had never failed to\r\n\r\n take up her lodging there in the spring. With the return of winter,\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle returns to the chateau, for there is no fireplace in The\r\n\r\n Yellow Room.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018We were staying in the pavilion, then\u2014Monsieur Stangerson and me.\r\n\r\n We made no noise. He was seated at his desk. As for me, I was sitting on a\r\n\r\n chair, having finished my work and, looking at him, I said to myself:\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat a man!\u2014what intelligence!\u2014what knowledge!\u201d I attach\r\n\r\n importance to the fact that we made no noise; for, because of that, the\r\n\r\n assassin certainly thought that we had left the place. And, suddenly,\r\n\r\n while the cuckoo was sounding the half after midnight, a desperate clamour\r\n\r\n broke out in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. It was the voice of Mademoiselle, crying\r\n\r\n \u201cMurder!\u2014murder!\u2014help!\u201d Immediately afterwards revolver shots\r\n\r\n rang out and there was a great noise of tables and furniture being thrown\r\n\r\n to the ground, as if in the course of a struggle, and again the voice of\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle calling, \u201cMurder!\u2014help!\u2014Papa!\u2014Papa!\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018You may be sure that we quickly sprang up and that Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n and I threw ourselves upon the door. But alas! it was locked, fast locked,\r\n\r\n on the inside, by the care of Mademoiselle, as I have told you, with key\r\n\r\n and bolt. We tried to force it open, but it remained firm. Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson was like a madman, and truly, it was enough to make him one,\r\n\r\n for we heard Mademoiselle still calling \u201cHelp!\u2014help!\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson showered terrible blows on the door, and wept with rage and\r\n\r\n sobbed with despair and helplessness.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018It was then that I had an inspiration. \u201cThe assassin must have entered\r\n\r\n by the window!\u201d I cried;\u2014\u201cI will go to the window!\u201d and I rushed\r\n\r\n from the pavilion and ran like one out of his mind.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018The inspiration was that the window of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d looks out in such\r\n\r\n a way that the park wall, which abuts on the pavilion, prevented my at\r\n\r\n once reaching the window. To get up to it one has first to go out of the\r\n\r\n park. I ran towards the gate and, on my way, met Bernier and his wife, the\r\n\r\n gate-keepers, who had been attracted by the pistol reports and by our\r\n\r\n cries. In a few words I told them what had happened, and directed the\r\n\r\n concierge to join Monsieur Stangerson with all speed, while his wife came\r\n\r\n with me to open the park gate. Five minutes later she and I were before\r\n\r\n the window of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018The moon was shining brightly and I saw clearly that no one had touched\r\n\r\n the window. Not only were the bars that protect it intact, but the blinds\r\n\r\n inside of them were drawn, as I had myself drawn them early in the\r\n\r\n evening, as I did every day, though Mademoiselle, knowing that I was tired\r\n\r\n from the heavy work I had been doing, had begged me not to trouble myself,\r\n\r\n but leave her to do it; and they were just as I had left them, fastened\r\n\r\n with an iron catch on the inside. The assassin, therefore, could not have\r\n\r\n passed either in or out that way; but neither could I get in.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018It was unfortunate,\u2014enough to turn one\u2019s brain! The door of the\r\n\r\n room locked on the inside and the blinds on the only window also fastened\r\n\r\n on the inside; and Mademoiselle still calling for help!\u2014No! she had\r\n\r\n ceased to call. She was dead, perhaps. But I still heard her father, in\r\n\r\n the pavilion, trying to break down the door.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018With the concierge I hurried back to the pavilion.
The door, in spite of\r\n\r\n the furious attempts of Monsieur Stangerson and Bernier to burst it open,\r\n\r\n was still holding firm; but at length, it gave way before our united\r\n\r\n efforts,\u2014and then what a sight met our eyes! I should tell you that,\r\n\r\n behind us, the concierge held the laboratory lamp\u2014a powerful lamp,\r\n\r\n that lit the whole chamber.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018I must also tell you, monsieur, that \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d is a very small\r\n\r\n room. Mademoiselle had furnished it with a fairly large iron bedstead, a\r\n\r\n small table, a night-commode; a dressing-table, and two chairs. By the\r\n\r\n light of the big lamp we saw all at a glance. Mademoiselle, in her\r\n\r\n night-dress, was lying on the floor in the midst of the greatest disorder.\r\n\r\n Tables and chairs had been overthrown, showing that there had been a\r\n\r\n violent struggle. Mademoiselle had certainly been dragged from her bed.\r\n\r\n She was covered with blood and had terrible marks of finger-nails on her\r\n\r\n throat,\u2014the flesh of her neck having been almost torn by the nails.\r\n\r\n From a wound on the right temple a stream of blood had run down and made a\r\n\r\n little pool on the floor. When Monsieur Stangerson saw his daughter in\r\n\r\n that state, he threw himself on his knees beside her, uttering a cry of\r\n\r\n despair. He ascertained that she still breathed. As to us, we searched for\r\n\r\n the wretch who had tried to kill our mistress, and I swear to you,\r\n\r\n monsieur, that, if we had found him, it would have gone hard with him!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018But how to explain that he was not there, that he had already escaped?\r\n\r\n It passes all imagination!\u2014Nobody under the bed, nobody behind the\r\n\r\n furniture!\u2014All that we discovered were traces, blood-stained marks\r\n\r\n of a man\u2019s large hand on the walls and on the door; a big handkerchief red\r\n\r\n with blood, without any initials, an old cap, and many fresh footmarks of\r\n\r\n a man on the floor,\u2014footmarks of a man with large feet whose\r\n\r\n boot-soles had left a sort of sooty impression. How had this man got away?\r\n\r\n How had he vanished? Don\u2019t forget, monsieur, that there is no chimney in\r\n\r\n \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. He could not have escaped by the door, which is narrow,\r\n\r\n and on the threshold of which the concierge stood with the lamp, while her\r\n\r\n husband and I searched for him in every corner of the little room, where\r\n\r\n it is impossible for anyone to hide himself. The door, which had been\r\n\r\n forced open against the wall, could not conceal anything behind it, as we\r\n\r\n assured ourselves. By the window, still in every way secured, no flight\r\n\r\n had been possible. What then?\u2014I began to believe in the Devil.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018But we discovered my revolver on the floor!\u2014Yes, my revolver! Oh!\r\n\r\n that brought me back to the reality! The Devil would not have needed to\r\n\r\n steal my revolver to kill Mademoiselle. The man who had been there had\r\n\r\n first gone up to my attic and taken my revolver from the drawer where I\r\n\r\n kept it. We then ascertained, by counting the cartridges, that the\r\n\r\n assassin had fired two shots. Ah! it was fortunate for me that Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson was in the laboratory when the affair took place and had seen\r\n\r\n with his own eyes that I was there with him; for otherwise, with this\r\n\r\n business of my revolver, I don\u2019t know where we should have been,\u2014I\r\n\r\n should now be under lock and bar. Justice wants no more to send a man to\r\n\r\n the scaffold!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The editor of the \u201cMatin\u201d added to this interview the following lines:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe have, without interrupting him, allowed Daddy Jacques to recount to us\r\n\r\n roughly all he knows about the crime of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. We have\r\n\r\n reproduced it in his own words, only sparing the reader the continual\r\n\r\n lamentations with which he garnished his narrative. It is quite\r\n\r\n understood, Daddy Jacques, quite understood, that you are very fond of\r\n\r\n your masters; and you want them to know it, and never cease repeating it\u2014especially\r\n\r\n since the discovery of your revolver. It is your right, and we see no harm\r\n\r\n in it. We should have liked to put some further questions to Daddy Jacques\u2014Jacques\u2014Louis\r\n\r\n Moustier\u2014but the inquiry of the examining magistrate, which is being\r\n\r\n carried on at the chateau, makes it impossible for us to gain admission at\r\n\r\n the Glandier; and, as to the oak wood, it is guarded by a wide circle of\r\n\r\n policemen, who are jealously watching all traces that can lead to the\r\n\r\n pavilion, and that may perhaps lead to the discovery of the assassin. \u201cWe\r\n\r\n have also wished to question the concierges, but they are invisible.\r\n\r\n Finally, we have waited in a roadside inn, not far from the gate of the\r\n\r\n chateau, for the departure of Monsieur de Marquet, the magistrate of\r\n\r\n Corbeil.
At half-past five we saw him and his clerk and, before he was\r\n\r\n able to enter his carriage, had an opportunity to ask him the following\r\n\r\n question:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018Can you, Monsieur de Marquet, give us any information as to this affair,\r\n\r\n without inconvenience to the course of your inquiry?\u2019\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018It is impossible for us to do it,\u2019 replied Monsieur de Marquet. \u2018I can\r\n\r\n only say that it is the strangest affair I have ever known. The more we\r\n\r\n think we know something, the further we are from knowing anything!\u2019\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe asked Monsieur de Marquet to be good enough to explain his last words;\r\n\r\n and this is what he said,\u2014the importance of which no one will fail\r\n\r\n to recognise:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018If nothing is added to the material facts so far established, I fear\r\n\r\n that the mystery which surrounds the abominable crime of which\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson has been the victim will never be brought to\r\n\r\n light; but it is to be hoped, for the sake of our human reason, that the\r\n\r\n examination of the walls, and of the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\u2014an\r\n\r\n examination which I shall to-morrow intrust to the builder who constructed\r\n\r\n the pavilion four years ago\u2014will afford us the proof that may not\r\n\r\n discourage us. For the problem is this: we know by what way the assassin\r\n\r\n gained admission,\u2014he entered by the door and hid himself under the\r\n\r\n bed, awaiting Mademoiselle Stangerson. But how did he leave? How did he\r\n\r\n escape? If no trap, no secret door, no hiding place, no opening of any\r\n\r\n sort is found; if the examination of the walls\u2014even to the\r\n\r\n demolition of the pavilion\u2014does not reveal any passage practicable\u2014not\r\n\r\n only for a human being, but for any being whatsoever\u2014if the ceiling\r\n\r\n shows no crack, if the floor hides no underground passage, one must really\r\n\r\n believe in the Devil, as Daddy Jacques says!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And the anonymous writer in the \u201cMatin\u201d added in this article\u2014which\r\n\r\n I have selected as the most interesting of all those that were published\r\n\r\n on the subject of this affair\u2014that the examining magistrate appeared\r\n\r\n to place a peculiar significance to the last sentence: \u201cOne must really\r\n\r\n believe in the Devil, as Jacques says.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The article concluded with these lines: \u201cWe wanted to know what Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques meant by the cry of the Bete Du Bon Dieu.\u201d The landlord of the\r\n\r\n Donjon Inn explained to us that it is the particularly sinister cry which\r\n\r\n is uttered sometimes at night by the cat of an old woman,\u2014Mother\r\n\r\n Angenoux, as she is called in the country. Mother Angenoux is a sort of\r\n\r\n saint, who lives in a hut in the heart of the forest, not far from the\r\n\r\n grotto of Sainte-Genevieve.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, the Bete Du Bon Dieu, Mother Angenoux, the Devil,\r\n\r\n Sainte-Genevieve, Daddy Jacques,\u2014here is a well entangled crime\r\n\r\n which the stroke of a pickaxe in the wall may disentangle for us\r\n\r\n to-morrow. Let us at least hope that, for the sake of our human reason, as\r\n\r\n the examining magistrate says. Meanwhile, it is expected that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n Stangerson\u2014who has not ceased to be delirious and only pronounces\r\n\r\n one word distinctly, \u2018Murderer! Murderer!\u2019\u2014will not live through the\r\n\r\n night.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n In conclusion, and at a late hour, the same journal announced that the\r\n\r\n Chief of the Surete had telegraphed to the famous detective, Frederic\r\n\r\n Larsan, who had been sent to London for an affair of stolen securities, to\r\n\r\n return immediately to Paris.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears for the First Time\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I remember as well as if it had occurred yesterday, the entry of young\r\n\r\n Rouletabille into my bedroom that morning. It was about eight o\u2019clock and\r\n\r\n I was still in bed reading the article in the \u201cMatin\u201d relative to the\r\n\r\n Glandier crime.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n But, before going further, it is time that I present my friend to the\r\n\r\n reader.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter. At that\r\n\r\n time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of\r\n\r\n examining magistrates, when I had gone to get a \u201cpermit to communicate\u201d\r\n\r\n for the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare.
He had, as they say, \u201ca good\r\n\r\n nut.\u201d He seemed to have taken his head\u2014round as a bullet\u2014out\r\n\r\n of a box of marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of\r\n\r\n the press\u2014all determined billiard-players\u2014had given him that\r\n\r\n nickname, which was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him. He was\r\n\r\n always as red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How,\r\n\r\n while still so young\u2014he was only sixteen and a half years old when I\r\n\r\n saw him for the first time\u2014had he already won his way on the press?\r\n\r\n That was what everybody who came into contact with him might have asked,\r\n\r\n if they had not known his history. At the time of the affair of the woman\r\n\r\n cut in pieces in the Rue Oberskampf\u2014another forgotten story\u2014he\r\n\r\n had taken to one of the editors of the \u201cEpoque,\u201d\u2014a paper then\r\n\r\n rivalling the \u201cMatin\u201d for information,\u2014the left foot, which was\r\n\r\n missing from the basket in which the gruesome remains were discovered. For\r\n\r\n this left foot the police had been vainly searching for a week, and young\r\n\r\n Rouletabille had found it in a drain where nobody had thought of looking\r\n\r\n for it. To do that he had dressed himself as an extra sewer-man, one of a\r\n\r\n number engaged by the administration of the city of Paris, owing to an\r\n\r\n overflow of the Seine.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n When the editor-in-chief was in possession of the precious foot and\r\n\r\n informed as to the train of intelligent deductions the boy had been led to\r\n\r\n make, he was divided between the admiration he felt for such detective\r\n\r\n cunning in a brain of a lad of sixteen years, and delight at being able to\r\n\r\n exhibit, in the \u201cmorgue window\u201d of his paper, the left foot of the Rue\r\n\r\n Oberskampf.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThis foot,\u201d he cried, \u201cwill make a great headline.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Then, when he had confided the gruesome packet to the medical lawyer\r\n\r\n attached to the journal, he asked the lad, who was shortly to become\r\n\r\n famous as Rouletabille, what he would expect to earn as a general reporter\r\n\r\n on the \u201cEpoque\u201d?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cTwo hundred francs a month,\u201d the youngster replied modestly, hardly able\r\n\r\n to breathe from surprise at the proposal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou shall have two hundred and fifty,\u201d said the editor-in-chief; \u201conly\r\n\r\n you must tell everybody that you have been engaged on the paper for a\r\n\r\n month. Let it be quite understood that it was not you but the \u2018Epoque\u2019\r\n\r\n that discovered the left foot of the Rue Oberskampf. Here, my young\r\n\r\n friend, the man is nothing, the paper everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Having said this, he begged the new reporter to retire, but before the\r\n\r\n youth had reached the door he called him back to ask his name. The other\r\n\r\n replied:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cJoseph Josephine.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s not a name,\u201d said the editor-in-chief, \u201cbut since you will not be\r\n\r\n required to sign what you write it is of no consequence.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The boy-faced reporter speedily made himself many friends, for he was\r\n\r\n serviceable and gifted with a good humour that enchanted the most\r\n\r\n severe-tempered and disarmed the most zealous of his companions. At the\r\n\r\n Bar cafe, where the reporters assembled before going to any of the courts,\r\n\r\n or to the Prefecture, in search of their news of crime, he began to win a\r\n\r\n reputation as an unraveller of intricate and obscure affairs which found\r\n\r\n its way to the office of the Chief of the Surete. When a case was worth\r\n\r\n the trouble and Rouletabille\u2014he had already been given his nickname\u2014had\r\n\r\n been started on the scent by his editor-in-chief, he often got the better\r\n\r\n of the most famous detective.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n It was at the Bar cafe that I became intimately acquainted with him.\r\n\r\n Criminal lawyers and journalists are not enemies, the former need\r\n\r\n advertisement, the latter information. We chatted together, and I soon\r\n\r\n warmed towards him. His intelligence was so keen, and so original!\u2014and\r\n\r\n he had a quality of thought such as I have never found in any other\r\n\r\n person.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Some time after this I was put in charge of the law news of the \u201cCri du\r\n\r\n Boulevard.\u201d My entry into journalism could not but strengthen the ties\r\n\r\n which united me to Rouletabille.
After a while, my new friend being\r\n\r\n allowed to carry out an idea of a judicial correspondence column, which he\r\n\r\n was allowed to sign \u201cBusiness,\u201d in the \u201cEpoque,\u201d I was often able to\r\n\r\n furnish him with the legal information of which he stood in need.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Nearly two years passed in this way, and the better I knew him, the more I\r\n\r\n learned to love him; for, in spite of his careless extravagance, I had\r\n\r\n discovered in him what was, considering his age, an extraordinary\r\n\r\n seriousness of mind. Accustomed as I was to seeing him gay and, indeed,\r\n\r\n often too gay, I would many times find him plunged in the deepest\r\n\r\n melancholy. I tried then to question him as to the cause of this change of\r\n\r\n humour, but each time he laughed and made me no answer. One day, having\r\n\r\n questioned him about his parents, of whom he never spoke, he left me,\r\n\r\n pretending not to have heard what I said.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n While things were in this state between us, the famous case of The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room took place. It was this case which was to rank him as the leading\r\n\r\n newspaper reporter, and to obtain for him the reputation of being the\r\n\r\n greatest detective in the world. It should not surprise us to find in the\r\n\r\n one man the perfection of two such lines of activity if we remember that\r\n\r\n the daily press was already beginning to transform itself and to become\r\n\r\n what it is to-day\u2014the gazette of crime.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Morose-minded people may complain of this; for myself I regard it a matter\r\n\r\n for congratulation. We can never have too many arms, public or private,\r\n\r\n against the criminal. To this some people may answer that, by continually\r\n\r\n publishing the details of crimes, the press ends by encouraging their\r\n\r\n commission. But then, with some people we can never do right.\r\n\r\n Rouletabille, as I have said, entered my room that morning of the 26th of\r\n\r\n October, 1892. He was looking redder than usual, and his eyes were bulging\r\n\r\n out of his head, as the phrase is, and altogether he appeared to be in a\r\n\r\n state of extreme excitement. He waved the \u201cMatin\u201d with a trembling hand,\r\n\r\n and cried:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWell, my dear Sainclair,\u2014have you read it?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe Glandier crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes; \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d!\u2014What do you think of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI think that it must have been the Devil or the Bete du Bon Dieu that\r\n\r\n committed the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBe serious!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWell, I don\u2019t much believe in murderers* who make their escape through\r\n\r\n walls of solid brick. I think Daddy Jacques did wrong to leave behind him\r\n\r\n the weapon with which the crime was committed and, as he occupied the\r\n\r\n attic immediately above Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room, the builder\u2019s job\r\n\r\n ordered by the examining magistrate will give us the key of the enigma and\r\n\r\n it will not be long before we learn by what natural trap, or by what\r\n\r\n secret door, the old fellow was able to slip in and out, and return\r\n\r\n immediately to the laboratory to Monsieur Stangerson, without his absence\r\n\r\n being noticed. That, of course, is only an hypothesis.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille sat down in an armchair, lit his pipe, which he was never\r\n\r\n without, smoked for a few minutes in silence\u2014no doubt to calm the\r\n\r\n excitement which, visibly, dominated him\u2014and then replied:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYoung man,\u201d he said, in a tone the sad irony of which I will not attempt\r\n\r\n to render, \u201cyoung man, you are a lawyer and I doubt not your ability to\r\n\r\n save the guilty from conviction; but if you were a magistrate on the\r\n\r\n bench, how easy it would be for you to condemn innocent persons!\u2014You\r\n\r\n are really gifted, young man!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He continued to smoke energetically, and then went on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo trap will be found, and the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d will become\r\n\r\n more and more mysterious. That\u2019s why it interests me. The examining\r\n\r\n magistrate is right; nothing stranger than this crime has ever been\r\n\r\n known.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHave you any idea of the way by which the murderer escaped?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNone,\u201d replied Rouletabille\u2014\u201cnone, for the present.
But I have an\r\n\r\n idea as to the revolver; the murderer did not use it.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cGood Heavens! By whom, then, was it used?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhy\u2014by Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u2014or rather, I have never understood,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIs there nothing in this article in the \u2018Matin\u2019 by which you were\r\n\r\n particularly struck?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNothing,\u2014I have found the whole of the story it tells equally\r\n\r\n strange.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWell, but\u2014the locked door\u2014with the key on the inside?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s the only perfectly natural thing in the whole article.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cReally!\u2014And the bolt?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe bolt?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, the bolt\u2014also inside the room\u2014a still further protection\r\n\r\n against entry? Mademoiselle Stangerson took quite extraordinary\r\n\r\n precautions! It is clear to me that she feared someone. That was why she\r\n\r\n took such precautions\u2014even Daddy Jacques\u2019s revolver\u2014without\r\n\r\n telling him of it. No doubt she didn\u2019t wish to alarm anybody, and least of\r\n\r\n all, her father. What she dreaded took place, and she defended herself.\r\n\r\n There was a struggle, and she used the revolver skilfully enough to wound\r\n\r\n the assassin in the hand\u2014which explains the impression on the wall\r\n\r\n and on the door of the large, blood-stained hand of the man who was\r\n\r\n searching for a means of exit from the chamber. But she didn\u2019t fire soon\r\n\r\n enough to avoid the terrible blow on the right temple.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen the wound on the temple was not done with the revolver?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe paper doesn\u2019t say it was, and I don\u2019t think it was; because logically\r\n\r\n it appears to me that the revolver was used by Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n against the assassin. Now, what weapon did the murderer use? The blow on\r\n\r\n the temple seems to show that the murderer wished to stun Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n Stangerson,\u2014after he had unsuccessfully tried to strangle her. He\r\n\r\n must have known that the attic was inhabited by Daddy Jacques, and that\r\n\r\n was one of the reasons, I think, why he must have used a quiet weapon,\u2014a\r\n\r\n life-preserver, or a hammer.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAll that doesn\u2019t explain how the murderer got out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d I\r\n\r\n observed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cEvidently,\u201d replied Rouletabille, rising, \u201cand that is what has to be\r\n\r\n explained. I am going to the Chateau du Glandier, and have come to see\r\n\r\n whether you will go with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI?\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, my boy. I want you. The \u2018Epoque\u2019 has definitely entrusted this case\r\n\r\n to me, and I must clear it up as quickly as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBut in what way can I be of any use to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur Robert Darzac is at the Chateau du Glandier.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s true. His despair must be boundless.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI must have a talk with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille said it in a tone that surprised me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIs it because\u2014you think there is something to be got out of him?\u201d I\r\n\r\n asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n That was all he would say.
He retired to my sitting-room, begging me to\r\n\r\n dress quickly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I knew Monsieur Robert Darzac from having been of great service to him in\r\n\r\n a civil action, while I was acting as secretary to Maitre Barbet Delatour.\r\n\r\n Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was at that time about forty years of age, was\r\n\r\n a professor of physics at the Sorbonne. He was intimately acquainted with\r\n\r\n the Stangersons, and, after an assiduous seven years\u2019 courtship of the\r\n\r\n daughter, had been on the point of marrying her. In spite of the fact that\r\n\r\n she has become, as the phrase goes, \u201ca person of a certain age,\u201d she was\r\n\r\n still remarkably good-looking. While I was dressing I called out to\r\n\r\n Rouletabille, who was impatiently moving about my sitting-room:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHave you any idea as to the murderer\u2019s station in life?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d he replied; \u201cI think if he isn\u2019t a man in society, he is, at least,\r\n\r\n a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again, is only an\r\n\r\n impression.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat has led you to form it?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWell,\u2014the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks of the\r\n\r\n rough boots on the floor,\u201d he replied.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI understand,\u201d I said; \u201cmurderers don\u2019t leave traces behind them which\r\n\r\n tell the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sainclair,\u201d concluded\r\n\r\n Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III. \u201cA Man Has Passed Like a Shadow Through the Blinds\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Half an hour later Rouletabille and I were on the platform of the Orleans\r\n\r\n station, awaiting the departure of the train which was to take us to\r\n\r\n Epinay-sur-Orge.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n On the platform we found Monsieur de Marquet and his Registrar, who\r\n\r\n represented the Judicial Court of Corbeil. Monsieur Marquet had spent the\r\n\r\n night in Paris, attending the final rehearsal, at the Scala, of a little\r\n\r\n play of which he was the unknown author, signing himself simply \u201cCastigat\r\n\r\n Ridendo.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet was beginning to be a \u201cnoble old gentleman.\u201d Generally\r\n\r\n he was extremely polite and full of gay humour, and in all his life had\r\n\r\n had but one passion,\u2014that of dramatic art. Throughout his\r\n\r\n magisterial career he was interested solely in cases capable of furnishing\r\n\r\n him with something in the nature of a drama. Though he might very well\r\n\r\n have aspired to the highest judicial positions, he had never really worked\r\n\r\n for anything but to win a success at the romantic Porte-Saint-Martin, or\r\n\r\n at the sombre Odeon.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Because of the mystery which shrouded it, the case of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n certain to fascinate so theatrical a mind. It interested him enormously,\r\n\r\n and he threw himself into it, less as a magistrate eager to know the\r\n\r\n truth, than as an amateur of dramatic embroglios, tending wholly to\r\n\r\n mystery and intrigue, who dreads nothing so much as the explanatory final\r\n\r\n act.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n So that, at the moment of meeting him, I heard Monsieur de Marquet say to\r\n\r\n the Registrar with a sigh:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI hope, my dear Monsieur Maleine, this builder with his pickaxe will not\r\n\r\n destroy so fine a mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHave no fear,\u201d replied Monsieur Maleine, \u201chis pickaxe may demolish the\r\n\r\n pavilion, perhaps, but it will leave our case intact. I have sounded the\r\n\r\n walls and examined the ceiling and floor and I know all about it. I am not\r\n\r\n to be deceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Having thus reassured his chief, Monsieur Maleine, with a discreet\r\n\r\n movement of the head, drew Monsieur de Marquet\u2019s attention to us.
The face\r\n\r\n of that gentleman clouded, and, as he saw Rouletabille approaching, hat in\r\n\r\n hand, he sprang into one of the empty carriages saying, half aloud to his\r\n\r\n Registrar, as he did so, \u201cAbove all, no journalists!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Maleine replied in the same tone, \u201cI understand!\u201d and then tried\r\n\r\n to prevent Rouletabille from entering the same compartment with the\r\n\r\n examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cExcuse me, gentlemen,\u2014this compartment is reserved.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI am a journalist, Monsieur, engaged on the \u2018Epoque,\u2019\u201d said my young\r\n\r\n friend with a great show of gesture and politeness, \u201cand I have a word or\r\n\r\n two to say to Monsieur de Marquet.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur is very much engaged with the inquiry he has in hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh! his inquiry, pray believe me, is absolutely a matter of indifference\r\n\r\n to me. I am no scavenger of odds and ends,\u201d he went on, with infinite\r\n\r\n contempt in his lower lip, \u201cI am a theatrical reporter; and this evening I\r\n\r\n shall have to give a little account of the play at the Scala.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cGet in, sir, please,\u201d said the Registrar.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille was already in the compartment. I went in after him and\r\n\r\n seated myself by his side. The Registrar followed and closed the carriage\r\n\r\n door.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet looked at him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh, sir,\u201d Rouletabille began, \u201cYou must not be angry with Monsieur de\r\n\r\n Maleine. It is not with Monsieur de Marquet that I desire to have the\r\n\r\n honour of speaking, but with Monsieur \u2018Castigat Ridendo.\u2019 Permit me to\r\n\r\n congratulate you\u2014personally, as well as the writer for the\r\n\r\n \u2018Epoque.\u2019\u201d And Rouletabille, having first introduced me, introduced\r\n\r\n himself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet, with a nervous gesture, caressed his beard into a\r\n\r\n point, and explained to Rouletabille, in a few words, that he was too\r\n\r\n modest an author to desire that the veil of his pseudonym should be\r\n\r\n publicly raised, and that he hoped the enthusiasm of the journalist for\r\n\r\n the dramatist\u2019s work would not lead him to tell the public that Monsieur\r\n\r\n \u201cCastigat Ridendo\u201d and the examining magistrate of Corbeil were one and\r\n\r\n the same person.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe work of the dramatic author may interfere,\u201d he said, after a slight\r\n\r\n hesitation, \u201cwith that of the magistrate, especially in a province where\r\n\r\n one\u2019s labours are little more than routine.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOh, you may rely on my discretion!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The train was in motion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe have started!\u201d said the examining magistrate, surprised at seeing us\r\n\r\n still in the carriage.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u2014truth has started,\u201d said Rouletabile, smiling\r\n\r\n amiably,\u2014\u201con its way to the Chateau du Glandier. A fine case,\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet,\u2014a fine case!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAn obscure\u2014incredible, unfathomable, inexplicable affair\u2014and\r\n\r\n there is only one thing I fear, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u2014that the\r\n\r\n journalists will be trying to explain it.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n My friend felt this a rap on his knuckles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d he said simply, \u201cthat is to be feared.
They meddle in everything.\r\n\r\n As for my interest, monsieur, I only referred to it by mere chance,\u2014the\r\n\r\n mere chance of finding myself in the same train with you, and in the same\r\n\r\n compartment of the same carriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhere are you going, then?\u201d asked Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cTo the Chateau du Glandier,\u201d replied Rouletabille, without turning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou\u2019ll not get in, Monsieur Rouletabille!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWill you prevent me?\u201d said my friend, already prepared to fight.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNot I!\u2014I like the press and journalists too well to be in any way\r\n\r\n disagreeable to them; but Monsieur Stangerson has given orders for his\r\n\r\n door to be closed against everybody, and it is well guarded. Not a\r\n\r\n journalist was able to pass through the gate of the Glandier yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet compressed his lips and seemed ready to relapse into\r\n\r\n obstinate silence. He only relaxed a little when Rouletabille no longer\r\n\r\n left him in ignorance of the fact that we were going to the Glandier for\r\n\r\n the purpose of shaking hands with an \u201cold and intimate friend,\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n Robert Darzac\u2014a man whom Rouletabille had perhaps seen once in his\r\n\r\n life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cPoor Robert!\u201d continued the young reporter, \u201cthis dreadful affair may be\r\n\r\n his death,\u2014he is so deeply in love with Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHis sufferings are truly painful to witness,\u201d escaped like a regret from\r\n\r\n the lips of Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBut it is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s life will be saved.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cLet us hope so. Her father told me yesterday that, if she does not\r\n\r\n recover, it will not be long before he joins her in the grave. What an\r\n\r\n incalculable loss to science his death would be!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe wound on her temple is serious, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cEvidently; but, by a wonderful chance, it has not proved mortal. The blow\r\n\r\n was given with great force.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen it was not with the revolver she was wounded,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n glancing at me in triumph.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet appeared greatly embarrassed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything\u2014I don\u2019t want to say anything\u2014I will not\r\n\r\n say anything,\u201d he said. And he turned towards his Registrar as if he no\r\n\r\n longer knew us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n But Rouletabille was not to be so easily shaken off. He moved nearer to\r\n\r\n the examining magistrate and, drawing a copy of the \u201cMatin\u201d from his\r\n\r\n pocket, he showed it to him and said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere is one thing, Monsieur, which I may enquire of you without\r\n\r\n committing an indiscretion. You have, of course, seen the account given in\r\n\r\n the \u2018Matin\u2019? It is absurd, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNot in the slightest, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat! \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d has but one barred window\u2014the bars of which\r\n\r\n have not been moved\u2014and only one door, which had to be broken open\u2014and\r\n\r\n the assassin was not found!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s so, monsieur,\u2014that\u2019s so. That\u2019s how the matter stands.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille said no more but plunged into thought. A quarter of an hour\r\n\r\n thus passed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Coming back to himself again he said, addressing the magistrate:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow did Mademoiselle Stangerson wear her hair on that evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s a very important point,\u201d said Rouletabille.
\u201cHer hair was done up\r\n\r\n in bands, wasn\u2019t it? I feel sure that on that evening, the evening of the\r\n\r\n crime, she had her hair arranged in bands.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen you are mistaken, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d replied the magistrate;\r\n\r\n \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson that evening had her hair drawn up in a knot on\r\n\r\n the top of her head,\u2014her usual way of arranging it\u2014her\r\n\r\n forehead completely uncovered. I can assure you, for we have carefully\r\n\r\n examined the wound. There was no blood on the hair, and the arrangement of\r\n\r\n it has not been disturbed since the crime was committed.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou are sure! You are sure that, on the night of the crime, she had not\r\n\r\n her hair in bands?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQuite sure,\u201d the magistrate continued, smiling, \u201cbecause I remember the\r\n\r\n Doctor saying to me, while he was examining the wound, \u2018It is a great pity\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson was in the habit of drawing her hair back from her\r\n\r\n forehead. If she had worn it in bands, the blow she received on the temple\r\n\r\n would have been weakened.\u2019 It seems strange to me that you should attach\r\n\r\n so much importance to this point.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOh! if she had not her hair in bands, I give it up,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n with a despairing gesture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd was the wound on her temple a bad one?\u201d he asked presently.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cTerrible.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWith what weapon was it made?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat is a secret of the investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHave you found the weapon\u2014whatever it was?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The magistrate did not answer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd the wound in the throat?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Here the examining magistrate readily confirmed the decision of the doctor\r\n\r\n that, if the murderer had pressed her throat a few seconds longer,\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson would have died of strangulation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe affair as reported in the \u2018Matin,\u2019\u201d said Rouletabille eagerly, \u201cseems\r\n\r\n to me more and more inexplicable. Can you tell me, Monsieur, how many\r\n\r\n openings there are in the pavilion? I mean doors and windows.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere are five,\u201d replied Monsieur de Marquet, after having coughed once\r\n\r\n or twice, but no longer resisting the desire he felt to talk of the whole\r\n\r\n of the incredible mystery of the affair he was investigating. \u201cThere are\r\n\r\n five, of which the door of the vestibule is the only entrance to the\r\n\r\n pavilion,\u2014a door always automatically closed, which cannot be\r\n\r\n opened, either from the outer or inside, except with the two special keys\r\n\r\n which are never out of the possession of either Daddy Jacques or Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson. Mademoiselle Stangerson had no need for one, since Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques lodged in the pavilion and because, during the daytime, she never\r\n\r\n left her father. When they, all four, rushed into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, after\r\n\r\n breaking open the door of the laboratory, the door in the vestibule\r\n\r\n remained closed as usual and, of the two keys for opening it, Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques had one in his pocket, and Monsieur Stangerson the other. As to\r\n\r\n the windows of the pavilion, there are four; the one window of The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room and those of the laboratory looking out on to the country; the window\r\n\r\n in the vestibule looking into the park.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt is by that window that he escaped from the pavilion!\u201d cried\r\n\r\n Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d demanded Monsieur de Marquet, fixing a strange\r\n\r\n look on my young friend.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe\u2019ll see later how he got away from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d replied\r\n\r\n Rouletabille, \u201cbut he must have left the pavilion by the vestibule\r\n\r\n window.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOnce more,\u2014how do you know that?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow? Oh, the thing is simple enough! As soon as he found he could not\r\n\r\n escape by the door of the pavilion his only way out was by the window in\r\n\r\n the vestibule, unless he could pass through a grated window.
The window of\r\n\r\n \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d is secured by iron bars, because it looks out upon the\r\n\r\n open country; the two windows of the laboratory have to be protected in\r\n\r\n like manner for the same reason. As the murderer got away, I conceive that\r\n\r\n he found a window that was not barred,\u2014that of the vestibule, which\r\n\r\n opens on to the park,\u2014that is to say, into the interior of the\r\n\r\n estate. There\u2019s not much magic in all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet, \u201cbut what you have not guessed is that\r\n\r\n this single window in the vestibule, though it has no iron bars, has solid\r\n\r\n iron blinds. Now these iron blinds have remained fastened by their iron\r\n\r\n latch; and yet we have proof that the murderer made his escape from the\r\n\r\n pavilion by that window! Traces of blood on the inside wall and on the\r\n\r\n blinds as well as on the floor, and footmarks, of which I have taken the\r\n\r\n measurements, attest the fact that the murderer made his escape that way.\r\n\r\n But then, how did he do it, seeing that the blinds remained fastened on\r\n\r\n the inside? He passed through them like a shadow. But what is more\r\n\r\n bewildering than all is that it is impossible to form any idea as to how\r\n\r\n the murderer got out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, or how he got across the\r\n\r\n laboratory to reach the vestibule! Ah, yes, Monsieur Rouletabille, it is\r\n\r\n altogether as you said, a fine case, the key to which will not be\r\n\r\n discovered for a long time, I hope.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou hope, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet corrected himself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI do not hope so,\u2014I think so.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cCould that window have been closed and refastened after the flight of the\r\n\r\n assassin?\u201d asked Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat is what occurred to me for a moment; but it would imply an\r\n\r\n accomplice or accomplices,\u2014and I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n After a short silence he added:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh\u2014if Mademoiselle Stangerson were only well enough to-day to be\r\n\r\n questioned!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille following up his thought, asked:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd the attic?\u2014There must be some opening to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes; there is a window, or rather skylight, in it, which, as it looks out\r\n\r\n towards the country, Monsieur Stangerson has had barred, like the rest of\r\n\r\n the windows. These bars, as in the other windows, have remained intact,\r\n\r\n and the blinds, which naturally open inwards, have not been unfastened.\r\n\r\n For the rest, we have not discovered anything to lead us to suspect that\r\n\r\n the murderer had passed through the attic.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt seems clear to you, then, Monsieur, that the murderer escaped\u2014nobody\r\n\r\n knows how\u2014by the window in the vestibule?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cEverything goes to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI think so, too,\u201d confessed Rouletabille gravely.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n After a brief silence, he continued:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf you have not found any traces of the murderer in the attic, such as\r\n\r\n the dirty footmarks similar to those on the floor of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, you\r\n\r\n must come to the conclusion that it was not he who stole Daddy Jacques\u2019s\r\n\r\n revolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere are no footmarks in the attic other than those of Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n himself,\u201d said the magistrate with a significant turn of his head. Then,\r\n\r\n after an apparent decision, he added: \u201cDaddy Jacques was with Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson in the laboratory\u2014and it was lucky for him he was.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen what part did his revolver play in the tragedy?\u2014It seems very\r\n\r\n clear that this weapon did less harm to Mademoiselle Stangerson than it\r\n\r\n did to the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The magistrate made no reply to this question, which doubtless embarrassed\r\n\r\n him.
\u201cMonsieur Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201ctells us that the two bullets have\r\n\r\n been found in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, one embedded in the wall stained with the\r\n\r\n impression of a red hand\u2014a man\u2019s large hand\u2014and the other in\r\n\r\n the ceiling.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOh! oh! in the ceiling!\u201d muttered Rouletabille. \u201cIn the ceiling! That\u2019s\r\n\r\n very curious!\u2014In the ceiling!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He puffed awhile in silence at his pipe, enveloping himself in the smoke.\r\n\r\n When we reached Savigny-sur-Orge, I had to tap him on the shoulder to\r\n\r\n arouse him from his dream and come out on to the platform of the station.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n There, the magistrate and his Registrar bowed to us, and by rapidly\r\n\r\n getting into a cab that was awaiting them, made us understand that they\r\n\r\n had seen enough of us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow long will it take to walk to the Chateau du Glandier?\u201d Rouletabille\r\n\r\n asked one of the railway porters.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAn hour and a half or an hour and three quarters\u2014easy walking,\u201d the\r\n\r\n man replied.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille looked up at the sky and, no doubt, finding its appearance\r\n\r\n satisfactory, took my arm and said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cCome on!\u2014I need a walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAre things getting less entangled?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNot a bit of it!\u201d he said, \u201cmore entangled than ever! It\u2019s true, I have\r\n\r\n an idea\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it is just at present\u2014it\u2019s an idea involving\r\n\r\n the life or death of two persons at least.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDo you think there were accomplices?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We fell into silence. Presently he went on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt was a bit of luck, our falling in with that examining magistrate and\r\n\r\n his Registrar, eh? What did I tell you about that revolver?\u201d His head was\r\n\r\n bent down, he had his hands in his pockets, and he was whistling. After a\r\n\r\n while I heard him murmur:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cPoor woman!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIs it Mademoiselle Stangerson you are pitying?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes; she\u2019s a noble woman and worthy of being pitied!\u2014a woman of a\r\n\r\n great, a very great character\u2014I imagine\u2014I imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou know her then?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNot at all. I have never seen her.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhy, then, do you say that she is a woman of great character?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBecause she bravely faced the murderer; because she courageously defended\r\n\r\n herself\u2014and, above all, because of the bullet in the ceiling.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I looked at Rouletabille and inwardly wondered whether he was not mocking\r\n\r\n me, or whether he had not suddenly gone out of his senses. But I saw that\r\n\r\n he had never been less inclined to laugh, and the brightness of his keenly\r\n\r\n intelligent eyes assured me that he retained all his reason. Then, too, I\r\n\r\n was used to his broken way of talking, which only left me puzzled as to\r\n\r\n his meaning, till, with a very few clear, rapidly uttered words, he would\r\n\r\n make the drift of his ideas clear to me, and I saw that what he had\r\n\r\n previously said, and which had appeared to me void of meaning, was so\r\n\r\n thoroughly logical that I could not understand how it was I had not\r\n\r\n understood him sooner.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV. \u201cIn the Bosom of Wild Nature\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The Chateau du Glandier is one of the oldest chateaux in the Ile de\r\n\r\n France, where so many building remains of the feudal period are still\r\n\r\n standing.
Built originally in the heart of the forest, in the reign of\r\n\r\n Philip le Bel, it now could be seen a few hundred yards from the road\r\n\r\n leading from the village of Sainte-Genevieve to Monthery. A mass of\r\n\r\n inharmonious structures, it is dominated by a donjon. When the visitor has\r\n\r\n mounted the crumbling steps of this ancient donjon, he reaches a little\r\n\r\n plateau where, in the seventeenth century, Georges Philibert de Sequigny,\r\n\r\n Lord of the Glandier, Maisons-Neuves and other places, built the existing\r\n\r\n town in an abominably rococo style of architecture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n It was in this place, seemingly belonging entirely to the past, that\r\n\r\n Professor Stangerson and his daughter installed themselves to lay the\r\n\r\n foundations for the science of the future. Its solitude, in the depths of\r\n\r\n woods, was what, more than all, had pleased them. They would have none to\r\n\r\n witness their labours and intrude on their hopes, but the aged stones and\r\n\r\n grand old oaks. The Glandier\u2014ancient Glandierum\u2014was so called\r\n\r\n from the quantity of glands (acorns) which, in all times, had been\r\n\r\n gathered in that neighbourhood. This land, of present mournful interest,\r\n\r\n had fallen back, owing to the negligence or abandonment of its owners,\r\n\r\n into the wild character of primitive nature. The buildings alone, which\r\n\r\n were hidden there, had preserved traces of their strange metamorphoses.\r\n\r\n Every age had left on them its imprint; a bit of architecture with which\r\n\r\n was bound up the remembrance of some terrible event, some bloody\r\n\r\n adventure. Such was the chateau in which science had taken refuge\u2014a\r\n\r\n place seemingly designed to be the theatre of mysteries, terror, and\r\n\r\n death.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Having explained so far, I cannot refrain from making one further\r\n\r\n reflection. If I have lingered a little over this description of the\r\n\r\n Glandier, it is not because I have reached the right moment for creating\r\n\r\n the necessary atmosphere for the unfolding of the tragedy before the eyes\r\n\r\n of the reader. Indeed, in all this matter, my first care will be to be as\r\n\r\n simple as is possible. I have no ambition to be an author. An author is\r\n\r\n always something of a romancer, and God knows, the mystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room is quite full enough of real tragic horror to require no aid from\r\n\r\n literary effects. I am, and only desire to be, a faithful \u201creporter.\u201d My\r\n\r\n duty is to report the event; and I place the event in its frame\u2014that\r\n\r\n is all. It is only natural that you should know where the things happened.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I return to Monsieur Stangerson. When he bought the estate, fifteen years\r\n\r\n before the tragedy with which we are engaged occurred, the Chateau du\r\n\r\n Glandier had for a long time been unoccupied. Another old chateau in the\r\n\r\n neighbourhood, built in the fourteenth century by Jean de Belmont, was\r\n\r\n also abandoned, so that that part of the country was very little\r\n\r\n inhabited. Some small houses on the side of the road leading to Corbeil,\r\n\r\n an inn, called the \u201cAuberge du Donjon,\u201d which offered passing hospitality\r\n\r\n to waggoners; these were about all to represent civilisation in this\r\n\r\n out-of-the-way part of the country, but a few leagues from the capital.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n But this deserted condition of the place had been the determining reason\r\n\r\n for the choice made by Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter. Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson was already celebrated. He had returned from America, where his\r\n\r\n works had made a great stir. The book which he had published at\r\n\r\n Philadelphia, on the \u201cDissociation of Matter by Electric Action,\u201d had\r\n\r\n aroused opposition throughout the whole scientific world. Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson was a Frenchman, but of American origin. Important matters\r\n\r\n relating to a legacy had kept him for several years in the United States,\r\n\r\n where he had continued the work begun by him in France, whither he had\r\n\r\n returned in possession of a large fortune. This fortune was a great boon\r\n\r\n to him; for, though he might have made millions of dollars by exploiting\r\n\r\n two or three of his chemical discoveries relative to new processes of\r\n\r\n dyeing, it was always repugnant to him to use for his own private gain the\r\n\r\n wonderful gift of invention he had received from nature. He considered he\r\n\r\n owed it to mankind, and all that his genius brought into the world went,\r\n\r\n by this philosophical view of his duty, into the public lap.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n If he did not try to conceal his satisfaction at coming into possession of\r\n\r\n this fortune, which enabled him to give himself up to his passion for pure\r\n\r\n science, he had equally to rejoice, it seemed to him, for another cause.\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson was, at the time when her father returned from\r\n\r\n America and bought the Glandier estate, twenty years of age. She was\r\n\r\n exceedingly pretty, having at once the Parisian grace of her mother, who\r\n\r\n had died in giving her birth, and all the splendour, all the riches of the\r\n\r\n young American blood of her parental grandfather, William Stangerson. A\r\n\r\n citizen of Philadelphia, William Stangerson had been obliged to become\r\n\r\n naturalised in obedience to family exigencies at the time of his marriage\r\n\r\n with a French lady, she who was to be the mother of the illustrious\r\n\r\n Stangerson.
In that way the professor\u2019s French nationality is accounted\r\n\r\n for.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Twenty years of age, a charming blonde, with blue eyes, milk-white\r\n\r\n complexion, and radiant with divine health, Mathilde Stangerson was one of\r\n\r\n the most beautiful marriageable girls in either the old or the new world.\r\n\r\n It was her father\u2019s duty, in spite of the inevitable pain which a\r\n\r\n separation from her would cause him, to think of her marriage; and he was\r\n\r\n fully prepared for it. Nevertheless, he buried himself and his child at\r\n\r\n the Glandier at the moment when his friends were expecting him to bring\r\n\r\n her out into society. Some of them expressed their astonishment, and to\r\n\r\n their questions he answered: \u201cIt is my daughter\u2019s wish. I can refuse her\r\n\r\n nothing. She has chosen the Glandier.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Interrogated in her turn, the young girl replied calmly: \u201cWhere could we\r\n\r\n work better than in this solitude?\u201d For Mademoiselle Stangerson had\r\n\r\n already begun to collaborate with her father in his work. It could not at\r\n\r\n the time be imagined that her passion for science would lead her so far as\r\n\r\n to refuse all the suitors who presented themselves to her for over fifteen\r\n\r\n years. So secluded was the life led by the two, father and daughter, that\r\n\r\n they showed themselves only at a few official receptions and, at certain\r\n\r\n times in the year, in two or three friendly drawing-rooms, where the fame\r\n\r\n of the professor and the beauty of Mathilde made a sensation. The young\r\n\r\n girl\u2019s extreme reserve did not at first discourage suitors; but at the end\r\n\r\n of a few years, they tired of their quest.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n One alone persisted with tender tenacity and deserved the name of \u201ceternal\r\n\r\n fiance,\u201d a name he accepted with melancholy resignation; that was Monsieur\r\n\r\n Robert Darzac. Mademoiselle Stangerson was now no longer young, and it\r\n\r\n seemed that, having found no reason for marrying at five-and-thirty, she\r\n\r\n would never find one. But such an argument evidently found no acceptance\r\n\r\n with Monsieur Robert Darzac. He continued to pay his court\u2014if the\r\n\r\n delicate and tender attention with which he ceaselessly surrounded this\r\n\r\n woman of five-and-thirty could be called courtship\u2014in face of her\r\n\r\n declared intention never to marry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Suddenly, some weeks before the events with which we are occupied, a\r\n\r\n report\u2014to which nobody attached any importance, so incredible did it\r\n\r\n sound\u2014was spread about Paris, that Mademoiselle Stangerson had at\r\n\r\n last consented to \u201ccrown\u201d the inextinguishable flame of Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n Darzac! It needed that Monsieur Robert Darzac himself should not deny this\r\n\r\n matrimonial rumour to give it an appearance of truth, so unlikely did it\r\n\r\n seem to be well founded. One day, however, Monsieur Stangerson, as he was\r\n\r\n leaving the Academy of Science, announced that the marriage of his\r\n\r\n daughter and Monsieur Robert Darzac would be celebrated in the privacy of\r\n\r\n the Chateau du Glandier, as soon as he and his daughter had put the\r\n\r\n finishing touches to their report summing up their labours on the\r\n\r\n \u201cDissociation of Matter.\u201d The new household would install itself in the\r\n\r\n Glandier, and the son-in-law would lend his assistance in the work to\r\n\r\n which the father and daughter had dedicated their lives.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The scientific world had barely had time to recover from the effect of\r\n\r\n this news, when it learned of the attempted assassination of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n under the extraordinary conditions which we have detailed and which our\r\n\r\n visit to the chateau was to enable us to ascertain with yet greater\r\n\r\n precision. I have not hesitated to furnish the reader with all these\r\n\r\n retrospective details, known to me through my business relations with\r\n\r\n Monsieur Robert Darzac. On crossing the threshold of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d he\r\n\r\n was as well posted as I was.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Makes a Remark to Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n Darzac Which Produces Its Little Effect\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille and I had been walking for several minutes, by the side of a\r\n\r\n long wall bounding the vast property of Monsieur Stangerson and had\r\n\r\n already come within sight of the entrance gate, when our attention was\r\n\r\n drawn to an individual who, half bent to the ground, seemed to be so\r\n\r\n completely absorbed in what he was doing as not to have seen us coming\r\n\r\n towards him. At one time he stooped so low as almost to touch the ground;\r\n\r\n at another he drew himself up and attentively examined the wall; then he\r\n\r\n looked into the palm of one of his hands, and walked away with rapid\r\n\r\n strides. Finally he set off running, still looking into the palm of his\r\n\r\n hand. Rouletabille had brought me to a standstill by a gesture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHush! Frederic Larsan is at work! Don\u2019t let us disturb him!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille had a great admiration for the celebrated detective. I had\r\n\r\n never before seen him, but I knew him well by reputation.
At that time,\r\n\r\n before Rouletabille had given proof of his unique talent, Larsan was\r\n\r\n reputed as the most skilful unraveller of the most mysterious and\r\n\r\n complicated crimes. His reputation was world-wide, and the police of\r\n\r\n London, and even of America, often called him in to their aid when their\r\n\r\n own national inspectors and detectives found themselves at the end of\r\n\r\n their wits and resources.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n No one was astonished, then, that the head of the Surete had, at the\r\n\r\n outset of the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, telegraphed his precious\r\n\r\n subordinate to London, where he had been sent on a big case of stolen\r\n\r\n securities, to return with all haste. Frederic who, at the Surete, was\r\n\r\n called the \u201cgreat Frederic,\u201d had made all speed, doubtless knowing by\r\n\r\n experience that, if he was interrupted in what he was doing, it was\r\n\r\n because his services were urgently needed in another direction; so, as\r\n\r\n Rouletabille said, he was that morning already \u201cat work.\u201d We soon found\r\n\r\n out in what it consisted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n What he was continually looking at in the palm of his right hand was\r\n\r\n nothing but his watch, the minute hand of which he appeared to be noting\r\n\r\n intently. Then he turned back still running, stopping only when he reached\r\n\r\n the park gate, where he again consulted his watch and then put it away in\r\n\r\n his pocket, shrugging his shoulders with a gesture of discouragement. He\r\n\r\n pushed open the park gate, reclosed and locked it, raised his head and,\r\n\r\n through the bars, perceived us. Rouletabille rushed after him, and I\r\n\r\n followed. Frederic Larsan waited for us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur Fred,\u201d said Rouletabille, raising his hat and showing the\r\n\r\n profound respect, based on admiration, which the young reporter felt for\r\n\r\n the celebrated detective, \u201ccan you tell me whether Monsieur Robert Darzac\r\n\r\n is at the chateau at this moment? Here is one of his friends, of the Paris\r\n\r\n Bar, who desires to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI really don\u2019t know, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d replied Fred, shaking hands\r\n\r\n with my friend, whom he had several times met in the course of his\r\n\r\n difficult investigations. \u201cI have not seen him.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe concierges will be able to inform us no doubt?\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n pointing to the lodge the door and windows of which were close shut.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe concierges will not be able to give you any information, Monsieur\r\n\r\n Rouletabille.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBecause they were arrested half an hour ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cArrested!\u201d cried Rouletabille; \u201cthen they are the murderers!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Frederic Larsan shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhen you can\u2019t arrest the real murderer,\u201d he said with an air of supreme\r\n\r\n irony, \u201cyou can always indulge in the luxury of discovering accomplices.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDid you have them arrested, Monsieur Fred?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNot I!\u2014I haven\u2019t had them arrested. In the first place, I am pretty\r\n\r\n sure that they have not had anything to do with the affair, and then\r\n\r\n because\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBecause of what?\u201d asked Rouletabille eagerly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBecause of nothing,\u201d said Larsan, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBecause there were no accomplices!\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAha!\u2014you have an idea, then, about this matter?\u201d said Larsan,\r\n\r\n looking at Rouletabille intently, \u201cyet you have seen nothing, young man\u2014you\r\n\r\n have not yet gained admission here!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI shall get admission.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI doubt it. The orders are strict.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI shall gain admission, if you let me see Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do that\r\n\r\n for me. You know we are old friends. I beg of you, Monsieur Fred. Do you\r\n\r\n remember the article I wrote about you on the gold bar case?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The face of Rouletabille at the moment was really funny to look at.
It\r\n\r\n showed such an irresistible desire to cross the threshold beyond which\r\n\r\n some prodigious mystery had occurred; it appealed with so much eloquence,\r\n\r\n not only of the mouth and eyes, but with all its features, that I could\r\n\r\n not refrain from bursting into laughter. Frederic Larsan, no more than\r\n\r\n myself, could retain his gravity. Meanwhile, standing on the other side of\r\n\r\n the gate, he calmly put the key in his pocket. I closely scrutinised him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He might be about fifty years of age. He had a fine head, his hair turning\r\n\r\n grey; a colourless complexion, and a firm profile. His forehead was\r\n\r\n prominent, his chin and cheeks clean shaven. His upper lip, without\r\n\r\n moustache, was finely chiselled. His eyes were rather small and round,\r\n\r\n with a look in them that was at once searching and disquieting. He was of\r\n\r\n middle height and well built, with a general bearing elegant and\r\n\r\n gentlemanly. There was nothing about him of the vulgar policeman. In his\r\n\r\n way, he was an artist, and one felt that he had a high opinion of himself.\r\n\r\n The sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who had been\r\n\r\n taught by experience. His strange profession had brought him into contact\r\n\r\n with so many crimes and villanies that it would have been remarkable if\r\n\r\n his nature had not been a little hardened.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Larsan turned his head at the sound of a vehicle which had come from the\r\n\r\n chateau and reached the gate behind him. We recognised the cab which had\r\n\r\n conveyed the examining magistrate and his Registrar from the station at\r\n\r\n Epinay.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh!\u201d said Frederic Larsan, \u201cif you want to speak with Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n Darzac, he is here.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The cab was already at the park gate and Robert Darzac was begging\r\n\r\n Frederic Larsan to open it for him, explaining that he was pressed for\r\n\r\n time to catch the next train leaving Epinay for Paris. Then he recognised\r\n\r\n me. While Larsan was unlocking the gate, Monsieur Darzac inquired what had\r\n\r\n brought me to the Glandier at such a tragic moment. I noticed that he was\r\n\r\n frightfully pale, and that his face was lined as if from the effects of\r\n\r\n some terrible suffering.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIs Mademoiselle getting better?\u201d I immediately asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will be saved perhaps. She must be saved!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He did not add \u201cor it will be my death\u201d; but I felt that the phrase\r\n\r\n trembled on his pale lips.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille intervened:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou are in a hurry, Monsieur; but I must speak with you. I have something\r\n\r\n of the greatest importance to tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Frederic Larsan interrupted:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMay I leave you?\u201d he asked of Robert Darzac. \u201cHave you a key, or do you\r\n\r\n wish me to give you this one.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThank you. I have a key and will lock the gate.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Larsan hurried off in the direction of the chateau, the imposing pile of\r\n\r\n which could be perceived a few hundred yards away.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Robert Darzac, with knit brow, was beginning to show impatience. I\r\n\r\n presented Rouletabille as a good friend of mine, but, as soon as he learnt\r\n\r\n that the young man was a journalist, he looked at me very reproachfully,\r\n\r\n excused himself, under the necessity of having to reach Epinay in twenty\r\n\r\n minutes, bowed, and whipped up his horse. But Rouletabille had seized the\r\n\r\n bridle and, to my utter astonishment, stopped the carriage with a vigorous\r\n\r\n hand. Then he gave utterance to a sentence which was utterly meaningless\r\n\r\n to me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its\r\n\r\n brightness.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The words had no sooner left the lips of Rouletabille than I saw Robert\r\n\r\n Darzac quail. Pale as he was, he became paler. His eyes were fixed on the\r\n\r\n young man in terror, and he immediately descended from the vehicle in an\r\n\r\n inexpressible state of agitation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cCome!\u2014come in!\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Then, suddenly, and with a sort of fury, he repeated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cLet us go, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He turned up by the road he had come from the chateau, Rouletabille still\r\n\r\n retaining his hold on the horse\u2019s bridle. I addressed a few words to\r\n\r\n Monsieur Darzac, but he made no answer.
My looks questioned Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n but his gaze was elsewhere.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI. In the Heart of the Oak Grove\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We reached the chateau, and, as we approached it, saw four gendarmes\r\n\r\n pacing in front of a little door in the ground floor of the donjon. We\r\n\r\n soon learned that in this ground floor, which had formerly served as a\r\n\r\n prison, Monsieur and Madame Bernier, the concierges, were confined.\r\n\r\n Monsieur Robert Darzac led us into the modern part of the chateau by a\r\n\r\n large door, protected by a projecting awning\u2014a \u201cmarquise\u201d as it is\r\n\r\n called. Rouletabille, who had resigned the horse and the cab to the care\r\n\r\n of a servant, never took his eyes off Monsieur Darzac. I followed his look\r\n\r\n and perceived that it was directed solely towards the gloved hands of the\r\n\r\n Sorbonne professor. When we were in a tiny sitting-room fitted with old\r\n\r\n furniture, Monsieur Darzac turned to Rouletabille and said sharply:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The reporter answered in an equally sharp tone:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cTo shake you by the hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Darzac shrank back.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Evidently he understood, what I also understood, that my friend suspected\r\n\r\n him of the abominable attempt on the life of Mademoiselle Stangerson. The\r\n\r\n impression of the blood-stained hand on the walls of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n in his mind. I looked at the man closely. His haughty face with its\r\n\r\n expression ordinarily so straightforward was at this moment strangely\r\n\r\n troubled. He held out his right hand and, referring to me, said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAs you are a friend of Monsieur Sainclair who has rendered me invaluable\r\n\r\n services in a just cause, monsieur, I see no reason for refusing you my\r\n\r\n hand\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille did not take the extended hand. Lying with the utmost\r\n\r\n audacity, he said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur, I have lived several years in Russia, where I have acquired the\r\n\r\n habit of never taking any but an ungloved hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I thought that the Sorbonne professor would express his anger openly, but,\r\n\r\n on the contrary, by a visibly violent effort, he calmed himself, took off\r\n\r\n his gloves, and showed his hands; they were unmarked by any cicatrix.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo!\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cMy dear friend,\u201d he said, turning to me, \u201cI\r\n\r\n am obliged to ask you to leave us alone for a moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I bowed and retired; stupefied by what I had seen and heard. I could not\r\n\r\n understand why Monsieur Robert Darzac had not already shown the door to my\r\n\r\n impertinent, insulting, and stupid friend. I was angry myself with\r\n\r\n Rouletabille at that moment, for his suspicions, which had led to this\r\n\r\n scene of the gloves.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n For some twenty minutes I walked about in front of the chateau, trying\r\n\r\n vainly to link together the different events of the day. What was in\r\n\r\n Rouletabille\u2019s mind? Was it possible that he thought Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n Darzac to be the murderer? How could it be thought that this man, who was\r\n\r\n to have married Mademoiselle Stangerson in the course of a few days, had\r\n\r\n introduced himself into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d to assassinate his fiancee? I\r\n\r\n could find no explanation as to how the murderer had been able to leave\r\n\r\n \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d; and so long as that mystery, which appeared to me so\r\n\r\n inexplicable, remained unexplained, I thought it was the duty of all of us\r\n\r\n to refrain from suspecting anybody. But, then, that seemingly senseless\r\n\r\n phrase\u2014\u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden\r\n\r\n its brightness\u201d\u2014still rang in my ears. What did it mean? I was eager\r\n\r\n to rejoin Rouletabille and question him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n At that moment the young man came out of the chateau in the company of\r\n\r\n Monsieur Robert Darzac, and, extraordinary to relate, I saw, at a glance,\r\n\r\n that they were the best of friends. \u201cWe are going to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. Come\r\n\r\n with us,\u201d Rouletabille said to me. \u201cYou know, my dear boy, I am going to\r\n\r\n keep you with me all day.
We\u2019ll breakfast together somewhere about here\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou\u2019ll breakfast with me, here, gentlemen\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d replied the young man. \u201cWe shall breakfast at the Donjon\r\n\r\n Inn.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou\u2019ll fare very badly there; you\u2019ll not find anything\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDo you think so? Well, I hope to find something there,\u201d replied\r\n\r\n Rouletabille. \u201cAfter breakfast, we\u2019ll set to work again. I\u2019ll write my\r\n\r\n article and if you\u2019ll be so good as to take it to the office for me\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWon\u2019t you come back with me to Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo; I shall remain here.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I turned towards Rouletabille. He spoke quite seriously, and Monsieur\r\n\r\n Robert Darzac did not appear to be in the least degree surprised.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We were passing by the donjon and heard wailing voices. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n asked:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhy have these people been arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt is a little my fault,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac. \u201cI happened to remark to\r\n\r\n the examining magistrate yesterday that it was inexplicable that the\r\n\r\n concierges had had time to hear the revolver shots, to dress themselves,\r\n\r\n and to cover so great a distance as that which lies between their lodge\r\n\r\n and the pavilion, in the space of two minutes; for not more than that\r\n\r\n interval of time had elapsed after the firing of the shots when they were\r\n\r\n met by Daddy Jacques.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat was suspicious evidently,\u201d acquiesced Rouletabille. \u201cAnd were they\r\n\r\n dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat is what is so incredible\u2014they were dressed\u2014completely\u2014not\r\n\r\n one part of their costume wanting. The woman wore sabots, but the man had\r\n\r\n on laced boots. Now they assert that they went to bed at half-past nine.\r\n\r\n On arriving this morning, the examining magistrate brought with him from\r\n\r\n Paris a revolver of the same calibre as that found in the room (for he\r\n\r\n couldn\u2019t use the one held for evidence), and made his Registrar fire two\r\n\r\n shots in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d while the doors and windows were closed. We were\r\n\r\n with him in the lodge of the concierges, and yet we heard nothing, not a\r\n\r\n sound. The concierges have lied, of that there can be no doubt. They must\r\n\r\n have been already waiting, not far from the pavilion, waiting for\r\n\r\n something! Certainly they are not to be accused of being the authors of\r\n\r\n the crime, but their complicity is not improbable. That was why Monsieur\r\n\r\n de Marquet had them arrested at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf they had been accomplices,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cthey would not have\r\n\r\n been there at all. When people throw themselves into the arms of justice\r\n\r\n with the proofs of complicity on them, you can be sure they are not\r\n\r\n accomplices. I don\u2019t believe there are any accomplices in this affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen, why were they abroad at midnight? Why don\u2019t they say?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThey have certainly some reason for their silence. What that reason is,\r\n\r\n has to be found out; for, even if they are not accomplices, it may be of\r\n\r\n importance. Everything that took place on such a night is important.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We had crossed an old bridge thrown over the Douve and were entering the\r\n\r\n part of the park called the Oak Grove, The oaks here were centuries old.\r\n\r\n Autumn had already shrivelled their tawny leaves, and their high branches,\r\n\r\n black and contorted, looked like horrid heads of hair, mingled with quaint\r\n\r\n reptiles such as the ancient sculptors have made on the head of Medusa.\r\n\r\n This place, which Mademoiselle found cheerful and in which she lived in\r\n\r\n the summer season, appeared to us as sad and funereal now. The soil was\r\n\r\n black and muddy from the recent rains and the rotting of the fallen\r\n\r\n leaves; the trunks of the trees were black and the sky above us was now,\r\n\r\n as if in mourning, charged with great, heavy clouds.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And it was in this sombre and desolate retreat that we saw the white walls\r\n\r\n of the pavilion as we approached. A queer-looking building without a\r\n\r\n window visible on the side by which we neared it. A little door alone\r\n\r\n marked the entrance to it.
It might have passed for a tomb, a vast\r\n\r\n mausoleum in the midst of a thick forest. As we came nearer, we were able\r\n\r\n to make out its disposition. The building obtained all the light it needed\r\n\r\n from the south, that is to say, from the open country. The little door\r\n\r\n closed on the park. Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson must have found\r\n\r\n it an ideal seclusion for their work and their dreams.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Here is the ground plan of the pavilion. It had a ground-floor which was\r\n\r\n reached by a few steps, and above it was an attic, with which we need not\r\n\r\n concern ourselves. The plan of the ground-floor only, sketched roughly, is\r\n\r\n what I here submit to the reader.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The plan was drawn by Rouletabille, and I assured myself that there was\r\n\r\n not a line in it that was wanting to help to the solution of the problem\r\n\r\n then set before the police. With the lines of this plan and the\r\n\r\n description of its parts before them, my readers will know as much as\r\n\r\n Rouletabille knew when he entered the pavilion for the first time. With\r\n\r\n him they may now ask: How did the murderer escape from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\r\n\r\n Before mounting the three steps leading up to the door of the pavilion,\r\n\r\n Rouletabille stopped and asked Monsieur Darzac point blank:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat was the motive for the crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cSpeaking for myself, Monsieur, there can be no doubt on the matter,\u201d said\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance, greatly distressed. \u201cThe nails of the\r\n\r\n fingers, the deep scratches on the chest and throat of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n Stangerson show that the wretch who attacked her attempted to commit a\r\n\r\n frightful crime. The medical experts who examined these traces yesterday\r\n\r\n affirm that they were made by the same hand as that which left its red\r\n\r\n imprint on the wall; an enormous hand, Monsieur, much too large to go into\r\n\r\n my gloves,\u201d he added with an indefinable smile.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cCould not that blood-stained hand,\u201d I interrupted, \u201chave been the hand of\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson who, in the moment of falling, had pressed it\r\n\r\n against the wall, and, in slipping, enlarged the impression?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere was not a drop of blood on either of her hands when she was lifted\r\n\r\n up,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe are now sure,\u201d said I, \u201cthat it was Mademoiselle Stangerson who was\r\n\r\n armed with Daddy Jacques\u2019s revolver, since she wounded the hand of the\r\n\r\n murderer. She was in fear, then, of somebody or something.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cProbably.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDo you suspect anybody?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac, looking at Rouletabille. Rouletabille then\r\n\r\n said to me:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou must know, my friend, that the inquiry is a little more advanced than\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet has chosen to tell us. He not only knows that\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson defended herself with the revolver, but he knows\r\n\r\n what the weapon was that was used to attack her. Monsieur Darzac tells me\r\n\r\n it was a mutton-bone. Why is Monsieur de Marquet surrounding this\r\n\r\n mutton-bone with so much mystery? No doubt for the purpose of facilitating\r\n\r\n the inquiries of the agents of the Surete? He imagines, perhaps, that the\r\n\r\n owner of this instrument of crime, the most terrible invented, is going to\r\n\r\n be found amongst those who are well-known in the slums of Paris who use\r\n\r\n it. But who can ever say what passes through the brain of an examining\r\n\r\n magistrate?\u201d Rouletabille added with contemptuous irony.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHas a mutton-bone been found in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\u201d I asked him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u201d said Robert Darzac, \u201cat the foot of the bed; but I beg of\r\n\r\n you not to say anything about it.\u201d (I made a gesture of assent.) \u201cIt was\r\n\r\n an enormous mutton-bone, the top of which, or rather the joint, was still\r\n\r\n red with the blood of the frightful wound. It was an old bone, which may,\r\n\r\n according to appearances, have served in other crimes. That\u2019s what\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet thinks. He has had it sent to the municipal laboratory\r\n\r\n at Paris to be analysed.
In fact, he thinks he has detected on it, not\r\n\r\n only the blood of the last victim, but other stains of dried blood,\r\n\r\n evidences of previous crimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA mutton-bone in the hand of a skilled assassin is a frightful weapon,\u201d\r\n\r\n said Rouletabille, \u201ca more certain weapon than a heavy hammer.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe scoundrel has proved it to be so,\u201d said Monsieur Robert Darzac,\r\n\r\n sadly. \u201cThe joint of the bone found exactly fits the wound inflicted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMy belief is that the wound would have been mortal, if the murderer\u2019s\r\n\r\n blow had not been arrested in the act by Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s\r\n\r\n revolver. Wounded in the hand, he dropped the mutton-bone and fled.\r\n\r\n Unfortunately, the blow had been already given, and Mademoiselle was\r\n\r\n stunned after having been nearly strangled. If she had succeeded in\r\n\r\n wounding the man with the first shot of the revolver, she would,\r\n\r\n doubtless, have escaped the blow with the bone. But she had certainly\r\n\r\n employeed her revolver too late; the first shot deviated and lodged in the\r\n\r\n ceiling; it was the second only that took effect.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Having said this, Monsieur Darzac knocked at the door of the pavilion. I\r\n\r\n must confess to feeling a strong impatience to reach the spot where the\r\n\r\n crime had been committed. It was some time before the door was opened by a\r\n\r\n man whom I at once recognised as Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He appeared to be well over sixty years of age. He had a long white beard\r\n\r\n and white hair, on which he wore a flat Basque cap. He was dressed in a\r\n\r\n complete suit of chestnut-coloured velveteen, worn at the sides; sabots\r\n\r\n were on his feet. He had rather a waspish-looking face, the expression of\r\n\r\n which lightened, however, as soon as he saw Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cFriends,\u201d said our guide. \u201cNobody in the pavilion, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI ought not to allow anybody to enter, Monsieur Robert, but of course the\r\n\r\n order does not apply to you. These gentlemen of justice have seen\r\n\r\n everything there is to be seen, and made enough drawings, and drawn up\r\n\r\n enough reports\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur Jacques, one question before anything else,\u201d said\r\n\r\n Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat is it, young man? If I can answer it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDid your mistress wear her hair in bands, that evening? You know what I\r\n\r\n mean\u2014over her forehead?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo, young man. My mistress never wore her hair in the way you suggest,\r\n\r\n neither on that day nor on any other. She had her hair drawn up, as usual,\r\n\r\n so that her beautiful forehead could be seen, pure as that of an unborn\r\n\r\n child!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille grunted and set to work examining the door, finding that it\r\n\r\n fastened itself automatically. He satisfied himself that it could never\r\n\r\n remain open and needed a key to open it. Then we entered the vestibule, a\r\n\r\n small, well-lit room paved with square red tiles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh! This is the window by which the murderer escaped!\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cSo they keep on saying, monsieur, so they keep on saying! But if he had\r\n\r\n gone off that way, we should have been sure to have seen him. We are not\r\n\r\n blind, neither Monsieur Stangerson nor me, nor the concierges who are in\r\n\r\n prison. Why have they not put me in prison, too, on account of my\r\n\r\n revolver?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille had already opened the window and was examining the shutters.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWere these closed at the time of the crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd fastened with the iron catch inside,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, \u201cand I am\r\n\r\n quite sure that the murderer did not get out that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAre there any blood stains?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, on the stones outside; but blood of what?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh!\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cthere are footmarks visible on the path\u2014the\r\n\r\n ground was very moist.
I will look into that presently.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNonsense!\u201d interrupted Daddy Jacques; \u201cthe murderer did not go that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhich way did he go, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow do I know?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille looked at everything, smelled everything. He went down on his\r\n\r\n knees and rapidly examined every one of the paving tiles. Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n went on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh!\u2014you can\u2019t find anything, monsieur. Nothing has been found. And\r\n\r\n now it is all dirty; too many persons have tramped over it. They wouldn\u2019t\r\n\r\n let me wash it, but on the day of the crime I had washed the floor\r\n\r\n thoroughly, and if the murderer had crossed it with his hobnailed boots, I\r\n\r\n should not have failed to see where he had been; he has left marks enough\r\n\r\n in Mademoiselle\u2019s chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille rose.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhen was the last time you washed these tiles?\u201d he asked, and he fixed on\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques a most searching look.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhy\u2014as I told you\u2014on the day of the crime, towards half-past\r\n\r\n five\u2014while Mademoiselle and her father were taking a little walk\r\n\r\n before dinner, here in this room: they had dined in the laboratory. The\r\n\r\n next day, the examining magistrate came and saw all the marks there were\r\n\r\n on the floor as plainly as if they had been made with ink on white paper.\r\n\r\n Well, neither in the laboratory nor in the vestibule, which were both as\r\n\r\n clean as a new pin, were there any traces of a man\u2019s footmarks. Since they\r\n\r\n have been found near this window outside, he must have made his way\r\n\r\n through the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d into the attic, then cut his way\r\n\r\n through the roof and dropped to the ground outside the vestibule window.\r\n\r\n But\u2014there\u2019s no hole, neither in the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d nor\r\n\r\n in the roof of my attic\u2014that\u2019s absolutely certain! So you see we\r\n\r\n know nothing\u2014nothing! And nothing will ever be known! It\u2019s a mystery\r\n\r\n of the Devil\u2019s own making.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille went down upon his knees again almost in front of a small\r\n\r\n lavatory at the back of the vestibule. In that position he remained for\r\n\r\n about a minute.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWell?\u201d I asked him when he got up.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOh! nothing very important,\u2014a drop of blood,\u201d he replied, turning\r\n\r\n towards Daddy Jacques as he spoke. \u201cWhile you were washing the laboratory\r\n\r\n and this vestibule, was the vestibule window open?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo, Monsieur, it was closed; but after I had done washing the floor, I\r\n\r\n lit some charcoal for Monsieur in the laboratory furnace, and, as I lit it\r\n\r\n with old newspapers, it smoked, so I opened both the windows in the\r\n\r\n laboratory and this one, to make a current of air; then I shut those in\r\n\r\n the laboratory and left this one open when I went out. When I returned to\r\n\r\n the pavilion, this window had been closed and Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n were already at work in the laboratory.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson had, no doubt, shut it?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou did not ask them?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n After a close scrutiny of the little lavatory and of the staircase leading\r\n\r\n up to the attic, Rouletabille\u2014to whom we seemed no longer to exist\u2014entered\r\n\r\n the laboratory. I followed him. It was, I confess, in a state of great\r\n\r\n excitement. Robert Darzac lost none of my friend\u2019s movements. As for me,\r\n\r\n my eyes were drawn at once to the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. It was closed\r\n\r\n and, as I immediately saw, partially shattered and out of commission.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n My friend, who went about his work methodically, silently studied the room\r\n\r\n in which we were. It was large and well-lighted. Two big windows\u2014almost\r\n\r\n bays\u2014were protected by strong iron bars and looked out upon a wide\r\n\r\n extent of country. Through an opening in the forest, they commanded a\r\n\r\n wonderful view through the length of the valley and across the plain to\r\n\r\n the large town which could be clearly seen in fair weather.
To-day,\r\n\r\n however, a mist hung over the ground\u2014and blood in that room!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The whole of one side of the laboratory was taken up with a large chimney,\r\n\r\n crucibles, ovens, and such implements as are needed for chemical\r\n\r\n experiments; tables, loaded with phials, papers, reports, an electrical\r\n\r\n machine,\u2014an apparatus, as Monsieur Darzac informed me, employeed by\r\n\r\n Professor Stangerson to demonstrate the Dissociation of Matter under the\r\n\r\n action of solar light\u2014and other scientific implements.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Along the walls were cabinets, plain or glass-fronted, through which were\r\n\r\n visible microscopes, special photographic apparatus, and a large quantity\r\n\r\n of crystals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille, who was ferreting in the chimney, put his fingers into one\r\n\r\n of the crucibles. Suddenly he drew himself up, and held up a piece of\r\n\r\n half-consumed paper in his hand. He stepped up to where we were talking by\r\n\r\n one of the windows.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cKeep that for us, Monsieur Darzac,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I bent over the piece of scorched paper which Monsieur Darzac took from\r\n\r\n the hand of Rouletabille, and read distinctly the only words that remained\r\n\r\n legible:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cPresbytery\u2014lost nothing\u2014charm, nor the gar\u2014its\r\n\r\n brightness.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Twice since the morning these same meaningless words had struck me, and,\r\n\r\n for the second time, I saw that they produced on the Sorbonne professor\r\n\r\n the same paralysing effect. Monsieur Darzac\u2019s first anxiety showed itself\r\n\r\n when he turned his eyes in the direction of Daddy Jacques. But, occupied\r\n\r\n as he was at another window, he had seen nothing. Then tremblingly opening\r\n\r\n his pocket-book he put the piece of paper into it, sighing: \u201cMy God!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n During this time, Rouletabille had mounted into the opening of the\r\n\r\n fire-grate\u2014that is to say, he had got upon the bricks of a furnace\u2014and\r\n\r\n was attentively examining the chimney, which grew narrower towards the\r\n\r\n top, the outlet from it being closed with sheets of iron, fastened into\r\n\r\n the brickwork, through which passed three small chimneys.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cImpossible to get out that way,\u201d he said, jumping back into the\r\n\r\n laboratory. \u201cBesides, even if he had tried to do it, he would have brought\r\n\r\n all that ironwork down to the ground. No, no; it is not on that side we\r\n\r\n have to search.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille next examined the furniture and opened the doors of the\r\n\r\n cabinet. Then he came to the windows, through which he declared no one\r\n\r\n could possibly have passed. At the second window he found Daddy Jacques in\r\n\r\n contemplation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWell, Daddy Jacques,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat are you looking at?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat policeman who is always going round and round the lake. Another of\r\n\r\n those fellows who think they can see better than anybody else!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know Frederic Larsan, Daddy Jacques, or you wouldn\u2019t speak of\r\n\r\n him in that way,\u201d said Rouletabille in a melancholy tone. \u201cIf there is\r\n\r\n anyone who will find the murderer, it will be he.\u201d And Rouletabille heaved\r\n\r\n a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBefore they find him, they will have to learn how they lost him,\u201d said\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques, stolidly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n At length we reached the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d itself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere is the door behind which some terrible scene took place,\u201d said\r\n\r\n Rouletabille, with a solemnity which, under any other circumstances, would\r\n\r\n have been comical.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII. In Which Rouletabille Sets Out on an Expedition Under the Bed\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille having pushed open the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d paused on the\r\n\r\n threshold saying, with an emotion which I only later understood, \u201cAh, the\r\n\r\n perfume of the lady in black!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The chamber was dark. Daddy Jacques was about to open the blinds when\r\n\r\n Rouletabille stopped him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDid not the tragedy take place in complete darkness?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo, young man, I don\u2019t think so.
Mademoiselle always had a nightlight on\r\n\r\n her table, and I lit it every evening before she went to bed. I was a sort\r\n\r\n of chambermaid, you must understand, when the evening came. The real\r\n\r\n chambermaid did not come here much before the morning. Mademoiselle worked\r\n\r\n late\u2014far into the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhere did the table with the night-light stand,\u2014far from the bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cSome way from the bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cCan you light the burner now?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled when the table\r\n\r\n was upset. All the rest of the things in the room remain just as they\r\n\r\n were. I have only to open the blinds for you to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWait.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the shutters of the two\r\n\r\n windows and the door of the vestibule.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n When we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place where\r\n\r\n the night-light was burning that night.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques who was in his stockings\u2014he usually left his sabots in\r\n\r\n the vestibule\u2014entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d with his bit of a vesta. We\r\n\r\n vaguely distinguished objects overthrown on the floor, a bed in one\r\n\r\n corner, and, in front of us, to the left, the gleam of a looking-glass\r\n\r\n hanging on the wall, near to the bed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat will do!\u2014you may now open the blinds,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t come any further,\u201d Daddy Jacques begged, \u201cyou may make marks with\r\n\r\n your boots, and nothing must be deranged; it\u2019s an idea of the magistrate\u2019s\u2014though\r\n\r\n he has nothing more to do here.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And he pushed open the shutter. The pale daylight entered from without,\r\n\r\n throwing a sinister light on the saffron-coloured walls. The floor\u2014for\r\n\r\n though the laboratory and the vestibule were tiled, \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d had a\r\n\r\n flooring of wood\u2014was covered with a single yellow mat which was\r\n\r\n large enough to cover nearly the whole room, under the bed and under the\r\n\r\n dressing-table\u2014the only piece of furniture that remained upright.\r\n\r\n The centre round table, the night-table and two chairs had been\r\n\r\n overturned. These did not prevent a large stain of blood being visible on\r\n\r\n the mat, made, as Daddy Jacques informed us, by the blood which had flowed\r\n\r\n from the wound on Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s forehead. Besides these\r\n\r\n stains, drops of blood had fallen in all directions, in line with the\r\n\r\n visible traces of the footsteps\u2014large and black\u2014of the\r\n\r\n murderer. Everything led to the presumption that these drops of blood had\r\n\r\n fallen from the wound of the man who had, for a moment, placed his red\r\n\r\n hand on the wall. There were other traces of the same hand on the wall,\r\n\r\n but much less distinct.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cSee!\u2014see this blood on the wall!\u201d I could not help exclaiming. \u201cThe\r\n\r\n man who pressed his hand so heavily upon it in the darkness must certainly\r\n\r\n have thought that he was pushing at a door! That\u2019s why he pressed on it so\r\n\r\n hard, leaving on the yellow paper the terrible evidence. I don\u2019t think\r\n\r\n there are many hands in the world of that sort. It is big and strong and\r\n\r\n the fingers are nearly all one as long as the other! The thumb is wanting\r\n\r\n and we have only the mark of the palm; but if we follow the trace of the\r\n\r\n hand,\u201d I continued, \u201cwe see that, after leaving its imprint on the wall,\r\n\r\n the touch sought the door, found it, and then felt for the lock\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo doubt,\u201d interrupted Rouletabille, chuckling,\u2014\u201conly there is no\r\n\r\n blood, either on the lock or on the bolt!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat does that prove?\u201d I rejoined with a good sense of which I was proud;\r\n\r\n \u201che might have opened the lock with his left hand, which would have been\r\n\r\n quite natural, his right hand being wounded.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHe didn\u2019t open it at all!\u201d Daddy Jacques again exclaimed.
\u201cWe are not\r\n\r\n fools; and there were four of us when we burst open the door!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat a queer hand!\u2014Look what a queer hand it is!\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt is a very natural hand,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cof which the shape has\r\n\r\n been deformed by its having slipped on the wall. The man dried his hand on\r\n\r\n the wall. He must be a man about five feet eight in height.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow do you come at that?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBy the height of the marks on the wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n My friend next occupied himself with the mark of the bullet in the wall.\r\n\r\n It was a round hole.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThis ball was fired straight, not from above, and consequently, not from\r\n\r\n below.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the lock and the\r\n\r\n bolt, satisfying himself that the door had certainly been burst open from\r\n\r\n the outside, and, further, that the key had been found in the lock on the\r\n\r\n inside of the chamber. He finally satisfied himself that with the key in\r\n\r\n the lock, the door could not possibly be opened from without with another\r\n\r\n key. Having made sure of all these details, he let fall these words:\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d\u2014Then sitting down on the ground, he hastily took\r\n\r\n off his boots and, in his socks, went into the room.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The first thing he did was to examine minutely the overturned furniture.\r\n\r\n We watched him in silence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYoung fellow, you are giving yourself a great deal of trouble,\u201d said\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques ironically.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille raised his head and said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou have spoken the simple truth, Daddy Jacques; your mistress did not\r\n\r\n have her hair in bands that evening. I was a donkey to have believed she\r\n\r\n did.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Then, with the suppleness of a serpent, he slipped under the bed.\r\n\r\n Presently we heard him ask:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAt what time, Monsieur Jacques, did Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n arrive at the laboratory?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAt six o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The voice of Rouletabille continued:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u2014he\u2019s been under here,\u2014that\u2019s certain; in fact, there was\r\n\r\n no where else where he could have hidden himself. Here, too, are the marks\r\n\r\n of his hobnails. When you entered\u2014all four of you\u2014did you look\r\n\r\n under the bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAt once,\u2014we drew it right out of its place\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd between the mattresses?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere was only one on the bed, and on that Mademoiselle was placed; and\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge immediately carried it into the\r\n\r\n laboratory. Under the mattress there was nothing but the metal netting,\r\n\r\n which could not conceal anything or anybody. Remember, monsieur, that\r\n\r\n there were four of us and we couldn\u2019t fail to see everything\u2014the\r\n\r\n chamber is so small and scantily furnished, and all was locked behind in\r\n\r\n the pavilion.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I ventured on a hypothesis:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cPerhaps he got away with the mattress\u2014in the mattress!\u2014Anything\r\n\r\n is possible, in the face of such a mystery! In their distress of mind\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge may not have noticed they were\r\n\r\n bearing a double weight; especially if the concierge were an accomplice! I\r\n\r\n throw out this hypothesis for what it is worth, but it explains many\r\n\r\n things,\u2014and particularly the fact that neither the laboratory nor\r\n\r\n the vestibule bear any traces of the footmarks found in the room.
If, in\r\n\r\n carrying Mademoiselle on the mattress from the laboratory of the chateau,\r\n\r\n they rested for a moment, there might have been an opportunity for the man\r\n\r\n in it to escape.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd then?\u201d asked Rouletabille, deliberately laughing under the bed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I felt rather vexed and replied:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u2014but anything appears possible\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe examining magistrate had the same idea, monsieur,\u201d said Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques, \u201cand he carefully examined the mattress. He was obliged to laugh\r\n\r\n at the idea, monsieur, as your friend is doing now,\u2014for whoever\r\n\r\n heard of a mattress having a double bottom?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I was myself obliged to laugh, on seeing that what I had said was absurd;\r\n\r\n but in an affair like this one hardly knows where an absurdity begins or\r\n\r\n ends.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n My friend alone seemed able to talk intelligently. He called out from\r\n\r\n under the bed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe mat here has been moved out of place,\u2014who did it?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe did, monsieur,\u201d explained Daddy Jacques. \u201cWhen we could not find the\r\n\r\n assassin, we asked ourselves whether there was not some hole in the floor\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere is not,\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cIs there a cellar?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo, there\u2019s no cellar. But that has not stopped our searching, and has\r\n\r\n not prevented the examining magistrate and his Registrar from studying the\r\n\r\n floor plank by plank, as if there had been a cellar under it.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The reporter then reappeared. His eyes were sparkling and his nostrils\r\n\r\n quivered. He remained on his hands and knees. He could not be better\r\n\r\n likened than to an admirable sporting dog on the scent of some unusual\r\n\r\n game. And, indeed, he was scenting the steps of a man,\u2014the man whom\r\n\r\n he has sworn to report to his master, the manager of the \u201cEpoque.\u201d It must\r\n\r\n not be forgotten that Rouletabille was first and last a journalist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Thus, on his hands and knees, he made his way to the four corners of the\r\n\r\n room, so to speak, sniffing and going round everything\u2014everything\r\n\r\n that we could see, which was not much, and everything that we could not\r\n\r\n see, which must have been infinite.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The toilette table was a simple table standing on four legs; there was\r\n\r\n nothing about it by which it could possibly be changed into a temporary\r\n\r\n hiding-place. There was not a closet or cupboard. Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n kept her wardrobe at the chateau.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille literally passed his nose and hands along the walls,\r\n\r\n constructed of solid brickwork. When he had finished with the walls, and\r\n\r\n passed his agile fingers over every portion of the yellow paper covering\r\n\r\n them, he reached to the ceiling, which he was able to touch by mounting on\r\n\r\n a chair placed on the toilette table, and by moving this ingeniously\r\n\r\n constructed stage from place to place he examined every foot of it. When\r\n\r\n he had finished his scrutiny of the ceiling, where he carefully examined\r\n\r\n the hole made by the second bullet, he approached the window, and, once\r\n\r\n more, examined the iron bars and blinds, all of which were solid and\r\n\r\n intact. At last, he gave a grunt of satisfaction and declared \u201cNow I am at\r\n\r\n ease!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWell,\u2014do you believe that the poor dear young lady was shut up when\r\n\r\n she was being murdered\u2014when she cried out for help?\u201d wailed Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d said the young reporter, drying his forehead, \u201c\u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n as tightly shut as an iron safe.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cis why this mystery is the most surprising I know. Edgar\r\n\r\n Allan Poe, in \u2018The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\u2019 invented nothing like it.\r\n\r\n The place of that crime was sufficiently closed to prevent the escape of a\r\n\r\n man; but there was that window through which the monkey, the perpetrator\r\n\r\n of the murder, could slip away! But here, there can be no question of an\r\n\r\n opening of any sort.
The door was fastened, and through the window blinds,\r\n\r\n secure as they were, not even a fly could enter or get out.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cTrue, true,\u201d assented Rouletabille as he kept on drying his forehead,\r\n\r\n which seemed to be perspiring less from his recent bodily exertion than\r\n\r\n from his mental agitation. \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s a great, a beautiful, and a very\r\n\r\n curious mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe Bete du bon Dieu,\u201d muttered Daddy Jacques, \u201cthe Bete du bon Dieu\r\n\r\n herself, if she had committed the crime, could not have escaped. Listen!\r\n\r\n Do you hear it? Hush!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques made us a sign to keep quiet and, stretching his arm towards\r\n\r\n the wall nearest the forest, listened to something which we could not\r\n\r\n hear.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt\u2019s answering,\u201d he said at length. \u201cI must kill it. It is too wicked,\r\n\r\n but it\u2019s the Bete du bon Dieu, and, every night, it goes to pray on the\r\n\r\n tomb of Sainte-Genevieve and nobody dares to touch her, for fear that\r\n\r\n Mother Angenoux should cast an evil spell on them.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow big is the Bete du bon Dieu?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNearly as big as a small retriever,\u2014a monster, I tell you. Ah!\u2014I\r\n\r\n have asked myself more than once whether it was not her that took our poor\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle by the throat with her claws. But the Bete du bon Dieu does\r\n\r\n not wear hobnailed boots, nor fire revolvers, nor has she a hand like\r\n\r\n that!\u201d exclaimed Daddy Jacques, again pointing out to us the red mark on\r\n\r\n the wall. \u201cBesides, we should have seen her as well as we would have seen\r\n\r\n a man\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cEvidently,\u201d I said. \u201cBefore we had seen this Yellow Room, I had also\r\n\r\n asked myself whether the cat of Mother Angenoux\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou also!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNot for a moment. After reading the article in the \u2018Matin,\u2019 I knew that a\r\n\r\n cat had nothing to do with the matter. But I swear now that a frightful\r\n\r\n tragedy has been enacted here. You say nothing about the Basque cap, or\r\n\r\n the handkerchief, found here, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOf course, the magistrate has taken them,\u201d the old man answered,\r\n\r\n hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI haven\u2019t seen either the handkerchief or the cap, yet I can tell you how\r\n\r\n they are made,\u201d the reporter said to him gravely.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOh, you are very clever,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, coughing and embarrassed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe handkerchief is a large one, blue with red stripes and the cap is an\r\n\r\n old Basque cap, like the one you are wearing now.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou are a wizard!\u201d said Daddy Jacques, trying to laugh and not quite\r\n\r\n succeeding. \u201cHow do you know that the handkerchief is blue with red\r\n\r\n stripes?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBecause, if it had not been blue with red stripes, it would not have been\r\n\r\n found at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Without giving any further attention to Daddy Jacques, my friend took a\r\n\r\n piece of paper from his pocket, and taking out a pair of scissors, bent\r\n\r\n over the footprints. Placing the paper over one of them he began to cut.\r\n\r\n In a short time he had made a perfect pattern which he handed to me,\r\n\r\n begging me not to lose it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He then returned to the window and, pointing to the figure of Frederic\r\n\r\n Larsan, who had not quitted the side of the lake, asked Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n whether the detective had, like himself, been working in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo,\u201d replied Robert Darzac, who, since Rouletabille had handed him the\r\n\r\n piece of scorched paper, had not uttered a word, \u201cHe pretends that he does\r\n\r\n not need to examine \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.
He says that the murderer made his\r\n\r\n escape from it in quite a natural way, and that he will, this evening,\r\n\r\n explain how he did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n As he listened to what Monsieur Darzac had to say, Rouletabille turned\r\n\r\n pale.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHas Frederic Larsan found out the truth, which I can only guess at?\u201d he\r\n\r\n murmured. \u201cHe is very clever\u2014very clever\u2014and I admire him. But\r\n\r\n what we have to do to-day is something more than the work of a policeman,\r\n\r\n something quite different from the teachings of experience. We have to\r\n\r\n take hold of our reason by the right end.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The reporter rushed into the open air, agitated by the thought that the\r\n\r\n great and famous Fred might anticipate him in the solution of the problem\r\n\r\n of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I managed to reach him on the threshold of the pavilion. \u201cCalm yourself,\r\n\r\n my dear fellow,\u201d I said. \u201cAren\u2019t you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d he confessed to me, with a deep sigh. \u201cI am quite satisfied. I have\r\n\r\n discovered many things.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMoral or material?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cSeveral moral,\u2014one material. This, for example.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And rapidly he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper in which he\r\n\r\n had placed a light-coloured hair from a woman\u2019s head.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VIII. The Examining Magistrate Questions Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Two minutes later, as Rouletabille was bending over the footprints\r\n\r\n discovered in the park, under the window of the vestibule, a man,\r\n\r\n evidently a servant at the chateau, came towards us rapidly and called out\r\n\r\n to Monsieur Darzac then coming out of the pavilion:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur Robert, the magistrate, you know, is questioning Mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Darzac uttered a muttered excuse to us and set off running\r\n\r\n towards the chateau, the man running after him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf the corpse can speak,\u201d I said, \u201cit would be interesting to be there.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe must know,\u201d said my friend. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the chateau.\u201d And he drew me\r\n\r\n with him. But, at the chateau, a gendarme placed in the vestibule denied\r\n\r\n us admission up the staircase of the first floor. We were obliged to wait\r\n\r\n down stairs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n This is what passed in the chamber of the victim while we were waiting\r\n\r\n below.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The family doctor, finding that Mademoiselle Stangerson was much better,\r\n\r\n but fearing a relapse which would no longer permit of her being\r\n\r\n questioned, had thought it his duty to inform the examining magistrate of\r\n\r\n this, who decided to proceed immediately with a brief examination. At this\r\n\r\n examination, the Registrar, Monsieur Stangerson, and the doctor were\r\n\r\n present. Later, I obtained the text of the report of the examination, and\r\n\r\n I give it here, in all its legal dryness:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQuestion. Are you able, mademoiselle, without too much fatiguing\r\n\r\n yourself, to give some necessary details of the frightful attack of which\r\n\r\n you have been the victim?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnswer. I feel much better, monsieur, and I will tell you all I know.\r\n\r\n When I entered my chamber I did not notice anything unusual there.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. Excuse me, mademoiselle,\u2014if you will allow me, I will ask you\r\n\r\n some questions and you will answer them. That will fatigue you less than\r\n\r\n making a long recital.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. Do so, monsieur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. What did you do on that day?\u2014I want you to be as minute and\r\n\r\n precise as possible. I wish to know all you did that day, if it is not\r\n\r\n asking too much of you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. I rose late, at ten o\u2019clock, for my father and I had returned home\r\n\r\n late on the night previously, having been to dinner at the reception given\r\n\r\n by the President of the Republic, in honour of the Academy of Science of\r\n\r\n Philadelphia. When I left my chamber, at half-past ten, my father was\r\n\r\n already at work in the laboratory. We worked together till midday.
We then\r\n\r\n took half-an-hour\u2019s walk in the park, as we were accustomed to do, before\r\n\r\n breakfasting at the chateau. After breakfast, we took another walk for\r\n\r\n half an hour, and then returned to the laboratory. There we found my\r\n\r\n chambermaid, who had come to set my room in order. I went into The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room to give her some slight orders and she directly afterwards left the\r\n\r\n pavilion, and I resumed my work with my father. At five o\u2019clock, we again\r\n\r\n went for a walk in the park and afterward had tea.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. Before leaving the pavilion at five o\u2019clock, did you go into your\r\n\r\n chamber?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. No, monsieur, my father went into it, at my request to bring me my\r\n\r\n hat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. And he found nothing suspicious there?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. Evidently no, monsieur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. It is, then, almost certain that the murderer was not yet concealed\r\n\r\n under the bed. When you went out, was the door of the room locked?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. No, there was no reason for locking it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. You were absent from the pavilion some length of time, Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson and you?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. About an hour.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. It was during that hour, no doubt, that the murderer got into the\r\n\r\n pavilion. But how? Nobody knows. Footmarks have been found in the park,\r\n\r\n leading away from the window of the vestibule, but none has been found\r\n\r\n going towards it. Did you notice whether the vestibule window was open\r\n\r\n when you went out?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. I don\u2019t remember.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur Stangerson. It was closed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. And when you returned?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson. I did not notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cM. Stangerson. It was still closed. I remember remarking aloud: \u2018Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques must surely have opened it while we were away.\u2019\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. Strange!\u2014Do you recollect, Monsieur Stangerson, if during your\r\n\r\n absence, and before going out, he had opened it? You returned to the\r\n\r\n laboratory at six o\u2019clock and resumed work?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson. Yes, monsieur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. And you did not leave the laboratory from that hour up to the moment\r\n\r\n when you entered your chamber?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cM. Stangerson. Neither my daughter nor I, monsieur. We were engaged on\r\n\r\n work that was pressing, and we lost not a moment,\u2014neglecting\r\n\r\n everything else on that account.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. Did you dine in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. For that reason.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. Are you accustomed to dine in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. We rarely dine there.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. Could the murderer have known that you would dine there that evening?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cM. Stangerson. Good Heavens!\u2014I think not. It was only when we\r\n\r\n returned to the pavilion at six o\u2019clock, that we decided, my daughter and\r\n\r\n I, to dine there. At that moment I was spoken to by my gamekeeper, who\r\n\r\n detained me a moment, to ask me to accompany him on an urgent tour of\r\n\r\n inspection in a part of the woods which I had decided to thin. I put this\r\n\r\n off until the next day, and begged him, as he was going by the chateau, to\r\n\r\n tell the steward that we should dine in the laboratory. He left me, to\r\n\r\n execute the errand and I rejoined my daughter, who was already at work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. At what hour, mademoiselle, did you go to your chamber while your\r\n\r\n father continued to work there?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. At midnight.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. Did Daddy Jacques enter \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d in the course of the evening?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. To shut the blinds and light the night-light.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. He saw nothing suspicious?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. He would have told us if he had seen.
Daddy Jacques is an honest man\r\n\r\n and very attached to me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. You affirm, Monsieur Stangerson, that Daddy Jacques remained with you\r\n\r\n all the time you were in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cM. Stangerson. I am sure of it. I have no doubt of that.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. When you entered your chamber, mademoiselle, you immediately shut the\r\n\r\n door and locked and bolted it? That was taking unusual precautions,\r\n\r\n knowing that your father and your servant were there? Were you in fear of\r\n\r\n something, then?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. My father would be returning to the chateau and Daddy Jacques would be\r\n\r\n going to his bed. And, in fact, I did fear something.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. You were so much in fear of something that you borrowed Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques\u2019s revolver without telling him you had done so?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. That is true. I did not wish to alarm anybody,\u2014the more, because\r\n\r\n my fears might have proved to have been foolish.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. What was it you feared?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. I hardly know how to tell you. For several nights, I seemed to hear,\r\n\r\n both in the park and out of the park, round the pavilion, unusual sounds,\r\n\r\n sometimes footsteps, at other times the cracking of branches. The night\r\n\r\n before the attack on me, when I did not get to bed before three o\u2019clock in\r\n\r\n the morning, on our return from the Elysee, I stood for a moment before my\r\n\r\n window, and I felt sure I saw shadows.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQ. How many?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA. Two. They moved round the lake,\u2014then the moon became clouded and\r\n\r\n I lost sight of them. At this time of the season, every year, I have\r\n\r\n generally returned to my apartment in the chateau for the winter; but this\r\n\r\n year I said to myself that I would not quit the pavilion before my father\r\n\r\n had finished the resume of his works on the \u2018Dissociation of Matter\u2019 for\r\n\r\n the Academy. I did not wish that that important work, which was to have\r\n\r\n been finished in the course of a few days, should be delayed by a change\r\n\r\n in our daily habit. You can well understand that I did not wish to speak\r\n\r\n of my childish fears to my father, nor did I say anything to Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n who, I knew, would not have been able to hold his tongue. Knowing that he\r\n\r\n had a revolver in his room, I took advantage of his absence and borrowed\r\n\r\n it, placing it in the drawer of my night-table.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Here the interrogation of Mademoiselle Stangerson concluded.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille waited patiently for Monsieur Robert Darzac, who soon\r\n\r\n appeared.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n From a room near the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had heard the\r\n\r\n interrogatory and now came to recount it to my friend with great\r\n\r\n exactitude, aided by an excellent memory. His docility still surprised me.\r\n\r\n Thanks to hasty pencil-notes, he was able to reproduce, almost textually,\r\n\r\n the questions and the answers given.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n It looked as if Monsieur Darzac were being employeed as the secretary of my\r\n\r\n young friend and acted as if he could refuse him nothing; nay, more, as if\r\n\r\n under a compulsion to do so.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The fact of the closed window struck the reporter as it had struck the\r\n\r\n magistrate. Rouletabille asked Darzac to repeat once more Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n Stangerson\u2019s account of how she and her father had spent their time on the\r\n\r\n day of the tragedy, as she had stated it to the magistrate. The\r\n\r\n circumstance of the dinner in the laboratory seemed to interest him in the\r\n\r\n highest degree; and he had it repeated to him three times. He also wanted\r\n\r\n to be sure that the forest-keeper knew that the professor and his daughter\r\n\r\n were going to dine in the laboratory, and how he had come to know it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n When Monsieur Darzac had finished, I said: \u201cThe examination has not\r\n\r\n advanced the problem much.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt has put it back,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt has thrown light upon it,\u201d said Rouletabille, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IX. Reporter and Detective\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The three of us went back towards the pavilion.
At some distance from the\r\n\r\n building the reporter made us stop and, pointing to a small clump of trees\r\n\r\n to the right of us, said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s where the murderer came from to get into the pavilion.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n As there were other patches of trees of the same sort between the great\r\n\r\n oaks, I asked why the murderer had chosen that one, rather than any of the\r\n\r\n others. Rouletabille answered me by pointing to the path which ran quite\r\n\r\n close to the thicket to the door of the pavilion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat path is as you see, topped with gravel,\u201d he said; \u201cthe man must have\r\n\r\n passed along it going to the pavilion, since no traces of his steps have\r\n\r\n been found on the soft ground. The man didn\u2019t have wings; he walked; but\r\n\r\n he walked on the gravel which left no impression of his tread. The gravel\r\n\r\n has, in fact, been trodden by many other feet, since the path is the most\r\n\r\n direct way between the pavilion and the chateau. As to the thicket, made\r\n\r\n of the sort of shrubs that don\u2019t flourish in the rough season\u2014laurels\r\n\r\n and fuchsias\u2014it offered the murderer a sufficient hiding-place until\r\n\r\n it was time for him to make his way to the pavilion. It was while hiding\r\n\r\n in that clump of trees that he saw Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson,\r\n\r\n and then Daddy Jacques, leave the pavilion. Gravel has been spread nearly,\r\n\r\n very nearly, up to the windows of the pavilion. The footprints of a man,\r\n\r\n parallel with the wall\u2014marks which we will examine presently, and\r\n\r\n which I have already seen\u2014prove that he only needed to make one\r\n\r\n stride to find himself in front of the vestibule window, left open by\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques. The man drew himself up by his hands and entered the\r\n\r\n vestibule.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAfter all it is very possible,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAfter all what? After all what?\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I begged of him not to be angry; but he was too much irritated to listen\r\n\r\n to me and declared, ironically, that he admired the prudent doubt with\r\n\r\n which certain people approached the most simple problems, risking nothing\r\n\r\n by saying \u201cthat is so, or \u2018that is not so.\u201d Their intelligence would have\r\n\r\n produced about the same result if nature had forgotten to furnish their\r\n\r\n brain-pan with a little grey matter. As I appeared vexed, my young friend\r\n\r\n took me by the arm and admitted that he had not meant that for me; he\r\n\r\n thought more of me than that.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf I did not reason as I do in regard to this gravel,\u201d he went on, \u201cI\r\n\r\n should have to assume a balloon!\u2014My dear fellow, the science of the\r\n\r\n aerostation of dirigible balloons is not yet developed enough for me to\r\n\r\n consider it and suppose that a murderer would drop from the clouds! So\r\n\r\n don\u2019t say a thing is possible, when it could not be otherwise. We know now\r\n\r\n how the man entered by the window, and we also know the moment at which he\r\n\r\n entered,\u2014during the five o\u2019clock walk of the professor and his\r\n\r\n daughter.
The fact of the presence of the chambermaid\u2014who had come\r\n\r\n to clean up \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\u2014in the laboratory, when Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson and his daughter returned from their walk, at half-past one,\r\n\r\n permits us to affirm that at half-past one the murderer was not in the\r\n\r\n chamber under the bed, unless he was in collusion with the chambermaid.\r\n\r\n What do you say, Monsieur Darzac?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Darzac shook his head and said he was sure of the chambermaid\u2019s\r\n\r\n fidelity, and that she was a thoroughly honest and devoted servant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBesides,\u201d he added, \u201cat five o\u2019clock Monsieur Stangerson went into the\r\n\r\n room to fetch his daughter\u2019s hat.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere is that also,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat the man entered by the window at the time you say, I admit,\u201d I said;\r\n\r\n \u201cbut why did he shut the window? It was an act which would necessarily\r\n\r\n draw the attention of those who had left it open.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt may be the window was not shut at once,\u201d replied the young reporter.\r\n\r\n \u201cBut if he did shut the window, it was because of the bend in the gravel\r\n\r\n path, a dozen yards from the pavilion, and on account of the three oaks\r\n\r\n that are growing at that spot.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d asked Monsieur Darzac, who had followed us and\r\n\r\n listened with almost breathless attention to all that Rouletabille had\r\n\r\n said.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI\u2019ll explain all to you later on, Monsieur, when I think the moment to be\r\n\r\n ripe for doing so; but I don\u2019t think I have anything of more importance to\r\n\r\n say on this affair, if my hypothesis is justified.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd what is your hypothesis?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou will never know if it does not turn out to be the truth. It is of\r\n\r\n much too grave a nature to speak of it, so long as it continues to be only\r\n\r\n a hypothesis.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHave you, at least, some idea as to who the murderer is?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo, monsieur, I don\u2019t know who the murderer is; but don\u2019t be afraid,\r\n\r\n Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2014I shall know.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I could not but observe that Monsieur Darzac was deeply moved; and I\r\n\r\n suspected that Rouletabille\u2019s confident assertion was not pleasing to him.\r\n\r\n Why, I asked myself, if he was really afraid that the murderer should be\r\n\r\n discovered, was he helping the reporter to find him? My young friend\r\n\r\n seemed to have received the same impression, for he said, bluntly:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur Darzac, don\u2019t you want me to find out who the murderer was?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOh!\u2014I should like to kill him with my own hand!\u201d cried Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n Stangerson\u2019s fiance, with a vehemence that amazed me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Rouletabille gravely; \u201cbut you have not answered my\r\n\r\n question.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We were passing by the thicket, of which the young reporter had spoken to\r\n\r\n us a minute before. I entered it and pointed out evident traces of a man\r\n\r\n who had been hidden there. Rouletabille, once more, was right.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, yes!\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do with a thing of flesh and blood, who\r\n\r\n uses the same means that we do. It\u2019ll all come out on those lines.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Having said this, he asked me for the paper pattern of the footprint which\r\n\r\n he had given me to take care of, and applied it to a very clear footmark\r\n\r\n behind the thicket.
\u201cAha!\u201d he said, rising.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I thought he was now going to trace back the track of the murderer\u2019s\r\n\r\n footmarks to the vestibule window; but he led us instead, far to the left,\r\n\r\n saying that it was useless ferreting in the mud, and that he was sure,\r\n\r\n now, of the road taken by the murderer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHe went along the wall to the hedge and dry ditch, over which he jumped.\r\n\r\n See, just in front of the little path leading to the lake, that was his\r\n\r\n nearest way to get out.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow do you know he went to the lake?\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBecause Frederic Larsan has not quitted the borders of it since this\r\n\r\n morning. There must be some important marks there.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n A few minutes later we reached the lake.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n It was a little sheet of marshy water, surrounded by reeds, on which\r\n\r\n floated some dead water-lily leaves. The great Fred may have seen us\r\n\r\n approaching, but we probably interested him very little, for he took\r\n\r\n hardly any notice of us and continued to be stirring with his cane\r\n\r\n something which we could not see.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cLook!\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201chere again are the footmarks of the escaping\r\n\r\n man; they skirt the lake here and finally disappear just before this path,\r\n\r\n which leads to the high road to Epinay. The man continued his flight to\r\n\r\n Paris.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d I asked, \u201csince these footmarks are not\r\n\r\n continued on the path?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat makes me think that?\u2014Why these footprints, which I expected to\r\n\r\n find!\u201d he cried, pointing to the sharply outlined imprint of a neat boot.\r\n\r\n \u201cSee!\u201d\u2014and he called to Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMonsieur Fred, these neat footprints seem to have been made since the\r\n\r\n discovery of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, young man, yes, they have been carefully made,\u201d replied Fred without\r\n\r\n raising his head. \u201cYou see, there are steps that come, and steps that go\r\n\r\n back.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd the man had a bicycle!\u201d cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Here, after looking at the marks of the bicycle, which followed, going and\r\n\r\n coming, the neat footprints, I thought I might intervene.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe bicycle explains the disappearance of the murderer\u2019s big\r\n\r\n foot-prints,\u201d I said. \u201cThe murderer, with his rough boots, mounted a\r\n\r\n bicycle. His accomplice, the wearer of the neat boots, had come to wait\r\n\r\n for him on the edge of the lake with the bicycle. It might be supposed\r\n\r\n that the murderer was working for the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo, no!\u201d replied Rouletabille with a strange smile. \u201cI have expected to\r\n\r\n find these footmarks from the very beginning. These are not the footmarks\r\n\r\n of the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen there were two?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo\u2014there was but one, and he had no accomplice.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cVery good!\u2014Very good!\u201d cried Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cLook!\u201d continued the young reporter, showing us the ground where it had\r\n\r\n been disturbed by big and heavy heels; \u201cthe man seated himself there, and\r\n\r\n took off his hobnailed boots, which he had worn only for the purpose of\r\n\r\n misleading detection, and then no doubt, taking them away with him, he\r\n\r\n stood up in his own boots, and quietly and slowly regained the high road,\r\n\r\n holding his bicycle in his hand, for he could not venture to ride it on\r\n\r\n this rough path. That accounts for the lightness of the impression made by\r\n\r\n the wheels along it, in spite of the softness of the ground. If there had\r\n\r\n been a man on the bicycle, the wheels would have sunk deeply into the\r\n\r\n soil.
No, no; there was but one man there, the murderer on foot.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBravo!\u2014bravo!\u201d cried Fred again, and coming suddenly towards us\r\n\r\n and, planting himself in front of Monsieur Robert Darzac, he said to him:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf we had a bicycle here, we might demonstrate the correctness of the\r\n\r\n young man\u2019s reasoning, Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do you know whether there\r\n\r\n is one at the chateau?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo!\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac. \u201cThere is not. I took mine, four days ago,\r\n\r\n to Paris, the last time I came to the chateau before the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s a pity!\u201d replied Fred, very coldly. Then, turning to Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n he said: \u201cIf we go on at this rate, we\u2019ll both come to the same\r\n\r\n conclusion. Have you any idea, as to how the murderer got away from The\r\n\r\n Yellow Room?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d said my young friend; \u201cI have an idea.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cSo have I,\u201d said Fred, \u201cand it must be the same as yours. There are no\r\n\r\n two ways of reasoning in this affair. I am waiting for the arrival of my\r\n\r\n chief before offering any explanation to the examining magistrate.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh! Is the Chief of the Surete coming?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, this afternoon. He is going to summon, before the magistrate, in the\r\n\r\n laboratory, all those who have played any part in this tragedy. It will be\r\n\r\n very interesting. It is a pity you won\u2019t be able to be present.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI shall be present,\u201d said Rouletabille confidently.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cReally\u2014you are an extraordinary fellow\u2014for your age!\u201d replied\r\n\r\n the detective in a tone not wholly free from irony. \u201cYou\u2019d make a\r\n\r\n wonderful detective\u2014if you had a little more method\u2014if you\r\n\r\n didn\u2019t follow your instincts and that bump on your forehead. As I have\r\n\r\n already several times observed, Monsieur Rouletabille, you reason too\r\n\r\n much; you do not allow yourself to be guided by what you have seen. What\r\n\r\n do you say to the handkerchief full of blood, and the red mark of the hand\r\n\r\n on the wall? You have seen the stain on the wall, but I have only seen the\r\n\r\n handkerchief.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBah!\u201d cried Rouletabille, \u201cthe murderer was wounded in the hand by\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s revolver!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh!\u2014a simply instinctive observation! Take care!\u2014You are\r\n\r\n becoming too strictly logical, Monsieur Rouletabille; logic will upset you\r\n\r\n if you use it indiscriminately. You are right, when you say that\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle Stangerson fired her revolver, but you are wrong when you say\r\n\r\n that she wounded the murderer in the hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI am sure of it,\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Fred, imperturbable, interrupted him:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDefective observation\u2014defective observation!\u2014the examination\r\n\r\n of the handkerchief, the numberless little round scarlet stains, the\r\n\r\n impression of drops which I found in the tracks of the footprints, at the\r\n\r\n moment when they were made on the floor, prove to me that the murderer was\r\n\r\n not wounded at all. Monsieur Rouletabille, the murderer bled at the nose!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The great Fred spoke quite seriously. However, I could not refrain from\r\n\r\n uttering an exclamation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The reporter looked gravely at Fred, who looked gravely at him. And Fred\r\n\r\n immediately concluded:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe man allowed the blood to flow into his hand and handkerchief, and\r\n\r\n dried his hand on the wall. The fact is highly important,\u201d he added,\r\n\r\n \u201cbecause there is no need of his being wounded in the hand for him to be\r\n\r\n the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille seemed to be thinking deeply. After a moment he said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThere is something\u2014a something, Monsieur Frederic Larsan, much\r\n\r\n graver than the misuse of logic the disposition of mind in some detectives\r\n\r\n which makes them, in perfect good faith, twist logic to the necessities of\r\n\r\n their preconceived ideas.
You, already, have your idea about the murderer,\r\n\r\n Monsieur Fred. Don\u2019t deny it; and your theory demands that the murderer\r\n\r\n should not have been wounded in the hand, otherwise it comes to nothing.\r\n\r\n And you have searched, and have found something else. It\u2019s dangerous, very\r\n\r\n dangerous, Monsieur Fred, to go from a preconceived idea to find the\r\n\r\n proofs to fit it. That method may lead you far astray Beware of judicial\r\n\r\n error, Monsieur Fred, it will trip you up!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And laughing a little, in a slightly bantering tone, his hands in his\r\n\r\n pockets, Rouletabille fixed his cunning eyes on the great Fred.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Frederic Larsan silently contemplated the young reporter who pretended to\r\n\r\n be as wise as himself. Shrugging his shoulders, he bowed to us and moved\r\n\r\n quickly away, hitting the stones on his path with his stout cane.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille watched his retreat, and then turned toward us, his face\r\n\r\n joyous and triumphant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI shall beat him!\u201d he cried. \u201cI shall beat the great Fred, clever as he\r\n\r\n is; I shall beat them all!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And he danced a double shuffle. Suddenly he stopped. My eyes followed his\r\n\r\n gaze; they were fixed on Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was looking anxiously\r\n\r\n at the impression left by his feet side by side with the elegant\r\n\r\n footmarks. There was not a particle of difference between them!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We thought he was about to faint. His eyes, bulging with terror, avoided\r\n\r\n us, while his right hand, with a spasmodic movement, twitched at the beard\r\n\r\n that covered his honest, gentle, and now despairing face. At length\r\n\r\n regaining his self-possession, he bowed to us, and remarking, in a changed\r\n\r\n voice, that he was obliged to return to the chateau, left us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe deuce!\u201d exclaimed Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He, also, appeared to be deeply concerned. From his pocket-book he took a\r\n\r\n piece of white paper as I had seen him do before, and with his scissors,\r\n\r\n cut out the shape of the neat bootmarks that were on the ground. Then he\r\n\r\n fitted the new paper pattern with the one he had previously made\u2014the\r\n\r\n two were exactly alike. Rising, Rouletabille exclaimed again: \u201cThe deuce!\u201d\r\n\r\n Presently he added: \u201cYet I believe Monsieur Robert Darzac to be an honest\r\n\r\n man.\u201d He then led me on the road to the Donjon Inn, which we could see on\r\n\r\n the highway, by the side of a small clump of trees.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER X. \u201cWe Shall Have to Eat Red Meat\u2014Now\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The Donjon Inn was of no imposing appearance; but I like these buildings\r\n\r\n with their rafters blackened with age and the smoke of their hearths\u2014these\r\n\r\n inns of the coaching-days, crumbling erections that will soon exist in the\r\n\r\n memory only. They belong to the bygone days, they are linked with history.\r\n\r\n They make us think of the Road, of those days when highwaymen rode.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I saw at once that the Donjon Inn was at least two centuries old\u2014perhaps\r\n\r\n older. Under its sign-board, over the threshold, a man with a\r\n\r\n crabbed-looking face was standing, seemingly plunged in unpleasant\r\n\r\n thought, if the wrinkles on his forehead and the knitting of his brows\r\n\r\n were any indication.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n When we were close to him, he deigned to see us and asked us, in a tone\r\n\r\n anything but engaging, whether we wanted anything. He was, no doubt, the\r\n\r\n not very amiable landlord of this charming dwelling-place. As we expressed\r\n\r\n a hope that he would be good enough to furnish us with a breakfast, he\r\n\r\n assured us that he had no provisions, regarding us, as he said this, with\r\n\r\n a look that was unmistakably suspicious.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou may take us in,\u201d Rouletabille said to him, \u201cwe are not policemen.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the police\u2014I\u2019m not afraid of anyone!\u201d replied the\r\n\r\n man.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I had made my friend understand by a sign that we should do better not to\r\n\r\n insist; but, being determined to enter the inn, he slipped by the man on\r\n\r\n the doorstep and was in the common room.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201cit is very comfortable here.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n A good fire was blazing in the chimney, and we held our hands to the\r\n\r\n warmth it sent out; it was a morning in which the approach of winter was\r\n\r\n unmistakable.
The room was a tolerably large one, furnished with two heavy\r\n\r\n tables, some stools, a counter decorated with rows of bottles of syrup and\r\n\r\n alcohol. Three windows looked out on to the road. A coloured advertisement\r\n\r\n lauded the many merits of a new vermouth. On the mantelpiece was arrayed\r\n\r\n the innkeeper\u2019s collection of figured earthenware pots and stone jugs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s a fine fire for roasting a chicken,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cWe have\r\n\r\n no chicken\u2014not even a wretched rabbit,\u201d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI know,\u201d said my friend slowly; \u201cI know\u2014We shall have to eat red\r\n\r\n meat\u2014now.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I confess I did not in the least understand what Rouletabille meant by\r\n\r\n what he had said; but the landlord, as soon as he heard the words, uttered\r\n\r\n an oath, which he at once stifled, and placed himself at our orders as\r\n\r\n obediently as Monsieur Robert Darzac had done, when he heard\r\n\r\n Rouletabille\u2019s prophetic sentence\u2014\u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing\r\n\r\n of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.\u201d Certainly my friend knew how\r\n\r\n to make people understand him by the use of wholly incomprehensible\r\n\r\n phrases. I observed as much to him, but he merely smiled. I should have\r\n\r\n proposed that he give me some explanation; but he put a finger to his\r\n\r\n lips, which evidently signified that he had not only determined not to\r\n\r\n speak, but also enjoined silence on my part.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Meantime the man had pushed open a little side door and called to somebody\r\n\r\n to bring him half a dozen eggs and a piece of beefsteak. The commission\r\n\r\n was quickly executed by a strongly-built young woman with beautiful blonde\r\n\r\n hair and large, handsome eyes, who regarded us with curiosity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The innkeeper said to her roughly:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cGet out!\u2014and if the Green Man comes, don\u2019t let me see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n She disappeared. Rouletabille took the eggs, which had been brought to him\r\n\r\n in a bowl, and the meat which was on a dish, placed all carefully beside\r\n\r\n him in the chimney, unhooked a frying-pan and a gridiron, and began to\r\n\r\n beat up our omelette before proceeding to grill our beefsteak. He then\r\n\r\n ordered two bottles of cider, and seemed to take as little notice of our\r\n\r\n host as our host did of him. The landlord let us do our own cooking and\r\n\r\n set our table near one of the windows.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Suddenly I heard him mutter:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh!\u2014there he is.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n His face had changed, expressing fierce hatred. He went and glued himself\r\n\r\n to one of the windows, watching the road. There was no need for me to draw\r\n\r\n Rouletabille\u2019s attention; he had already left our omelette and had joined\r\n\r\n the landlord at the window. I went with him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n A man dressed entirely in green velvet, his head covered with a huntsman\u2019s\r\n\r\n cap of the same colour, was advancing leisurely, lighting a pipe as he\r\n\r\n walked. He carried a fowling-piece slung at his back. His movements\r\n\r\n displayed an almost aristocratic ease. He wore eye-glasses and appeared to\r\n\r\n be about five and forty years of age. His hair as well as his moustache\r\n\r\n were salt grey. He was remarkably handsome. As he passed near the inn, he\r\n\r\n hesitated, as if asking himself whether or no he should enter it; gave a\r\n\r\n glance towards us, took a few whiffs at his pipe, and then resumed his\r\n\r\n walk at the same nonchalant pace.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille and I looked at our host. His flashing eyes, his clenched\r\n\r\n hands, his trembling lips, told us of the tumultuous feelings by which he\r\n\r\n was being agitated.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHe has done well not to come in here to-day!\u201d he hissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWho is that man?\u201d asked Rouletabille, returning to his omelette.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe Green Man,\u201d growled the innkeeper. \u201cDon\u2019t you know him? Then all the\r\n\r\n better for you. He is not an acquaintance to make.\u2014Well, he is\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s forest-keeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou don\u2019t appear to like him very much?\u201d asked the reporter, pouring his\r\n\r\n omelette into the frying-pan.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNobody likes him, monsieur. He\u2019s an upstart who must once have had a\r\n\r\n fortune of his own; and he forgives nobody because, in order to live, he\r\n\r\n has been compelled to become a servant.
A keeper is as much a servant as\r\n\r\n any other, isn\u2019t he? Upon my word, one would say that he is the master of\r\n\r\n the Glandier, and that all the land and woods belong to him. He\u2019ll not let\r\n\r\n a poor creature eat a morsel of bread on the grass\u2014his grass!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDoes he often come here?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cToo often. But I\u2019ve made him understand that his face doesn\u2019t please me,\r\n\r\n and, for a month past, he hasn\u2019t been here. The Donjon Inn has never\r\n\r\n existed for him!\u2014he hasn\u2019t had time!\u2014been too much engaged in\r\n\r\n paying court to the landlady of the Three Lilies at Saint-Michel. A bad\r\n\r\n fellow!\u2014There isn\u2019t an honest man who can bear him. Why, the\r\n\r\n concierges of the chateau would turn their eyes away from a picture of\r\n\r\n him!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe concierges of the chateau are honest people, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, they are, as true as my name\u2019s Mathieu, monsieur. I believe them to\r\n\r\n be honest.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYet they\u2019ve been arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat does that prove?\u2014But I don\u2019t want to mix myself up in other\r\n\r\n people\u2019s affairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd what do you think of the murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOf the murder of poor Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u2014A good girl much\r\n\r\n loved everywhere in the country. That\u2019s what I think of it\u2014and many\r\n\r\n things besides; but that\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNot even mine?\u201d insisted Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The innkeeper looked at him sideways and said gruffly:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNot even yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The omelette ready, we sat down at table and were silently eating, when\r\n\r\n the door was pushed open and an old woman, dressed in rags, leaning on a\r\n\r\n stick, her head doddering, her white hair hanging loosely over her\r\n\r\n wrinkled forehead, appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh!\u2014there you are, Mother Angenoux!\u2014It\u2019s long since we saw\r\n\r\n you last,\u201d said our host.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI have been very ill, very nearly dying,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cIf ever\r\n\r\n you should have any scraps for the Bete du Bon Dieu\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And she entered, followed by a cat, larger than any I had ever believed\r\n\r\n could exist. The beast looked at us and gave so hopeless a miau that I\r\n\r\n shuddered. I had never heard so lugubrious a cry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n As if drawn by the cat\u2019s cry a man followed the old woman in. It was the\r\n\r\n Green Man. He saluted by raising his hand to his cap and seated himself at\r\n\r\n a table near to ours.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cA glass of cider, Daddy Mathieu,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n As the Green Man entered, Daddy Mathieu had started violently; but visibly\r\n\r\n mastering himself he said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI\u2019ve no more cider; I served the last bottles to these gentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen give me a glass of white wine,\u201d said the Green Man, without showing\r\n\r\n the least surprise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI\u2019ve no more white wine\u2014no more anything,\u201d said Daddy Mathieu,\r\n\r\n surlily.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow is Madame Mathieu?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cQuite well, thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n So the young Woman with the large, tender eyes, whom we had just seen, was\r\n\r\n the wife of this repugnant and brutal rustic, whose jealousy seemed to\r\n\r\n emphasise his physical ugliness.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Slamming the door behind him, the innkeeper left the room.
Mother Angenoux\r\n\r\n was still standing, leaning on her stick, the cat at her feet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been ill, Mother Angenoux?\u2014Is that why we have not seen you\r\n\r\n for the last week?\u201d asked the Green Man.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, Monsieur keeper. I have been able to get up but three times, to go\r\n\r\n to pray to Sainte-Genevieve, our good patroness, and the rest of the time\r\n\r\n I have been lying on my bed. There was no one to care for me but the Bete\r\n\r\n du bon Dieu!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDid she not leave you?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNeither by day nor by night.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAre you sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAs I am of Paradise.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen how was it, Madame Angenoux, that all through the night of the\r\n\r\n murder nothing but the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu was heard?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Mother Angenoux planted herself in front of the forest-keeper and struck\r\n\r\n the floor with her stick.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut shall I tell you\r\n\r\n something? There are no two cats in the world that cry like that. Well, on\r\n\r\n the night of the murder I also heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu\r\n\r\n outside; and yet she was on my knees, and did not mew once, I swear. I\r\n\r\n crossed myself when I heard that, as if I had heard the devil.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I looked at the keeper when he put the last question, and I am much\r\n\r\n mistaken if I did not detect an evil smile on his lips. At that moment,\r\n\r\n the noise of loud quarrelling reached us. We even thought we heard a dull\r\n\r\n sound of blows, as if some one was being beaten. The Green Man quickly\r\n\r\n rose and hurried to the door by the side of the fireplace; but it was\r\n\r\n opened by the landlord who appeared, and said to the keeper:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t alarm yourself, Monsieur\u2014it is my wife; she has the\r\n\r\n toothache.\u201d And he laughed. \u201cHere, Mother Angenoux, here are some scraps\r\n\r\n for your cat.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He held out a packet to the old woman, who took it eagerly and went out by\r\n\r\n the door, closely followed by her cat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen you won\u2019t serve me?\u201d asked the Green Man.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Daddy Mathieu\u2019s face was placid and no longer retained its expression of\r\n\r\n hatred.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI\u2019ve nothing for you\u2014nothing for you. Take yourself off.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The Green Man quietly refilled his pipe, lit it, bowed to us, and went\r\n\r\n out. No sooner was he over the threshold than Daddy Mathieu slammed the\r\n\r\n door after him and, turning towards us, with eyes bloodshot, and frothing\r\n\r\n at the mouth, he hissed to us, shaking his clenched fist at the door he\r\n\r\n had just shut on the man he evidently hated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are who tell me \u2018We shall have to eat red meat\u2014now\u2019;\r\n\r\n but if it will interest you to know it\u2014that man is the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n With which words Daddy Mathieu immediately left us. Rouletabille returned\r\n\r\n towards the fireplace and said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNow we\u2019ll grill our steak. How do you like the cider?\u2014It\u2019s a little\r\n\r\n tart, but I like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We saw no more of Daddy Mathieu that day, and absolute silence reigned in\r\n\r\n the inn when we left it, after placing five francs on the table in payment\r\n\r\n for our feast.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille at once set off on a three mile walk round Professor\r\n\r\n Stangerson\u2019s estate.
He halted for some ten minutes at the corner of a\r\n\r\n narrow road black with soot, near to some charcoal-burners\u2019 huts in the\r\n\r\n forest of Sainte-Genevieve, which touches on the road from Epinay to\r\n\r\n Corbeil, to tell me that the murderer had certainly passed that way,\r\n\r\n before entering the grounds and concealing himself in the little clump of\r\n\r\n trees.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou don\u2019t think, then, that the keeper knows anything of it?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe shall see that, later,\u201d he replied. \u201cFor the present I\u2019m not\r\n\r\n interested in what the landlord said about the man. The landlord hates\r\n\r\n him. I didn\u2019t take you to breakfast at the Donjon Inn for the sake of the\r\n\r\n Green Man.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Then Rouletabille, with great precaution glided, followed by me, towards\r\n\r\n the little building which, standing near the park gate, served for the\r\n\r\n home of the concierges, who had been arrested that morning. With the skill\r\n\r\n of an acrobat, he got into the lodge by an upper window which had been\r\n\r\n left open, and returned ten minutes later. He said only, \u201cAh!\u201d\u2014a\r\n\r\n word which, in his mouth, signified many things.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We were about to take the road leading to the chateau, when a considerable\r\n\r\n stir at the park gate attracted our attention. A carriage had arrived and\r\n\r\n some people had come from the chateau to meet it. Rouletabille pointed out\r\n\r\n to me a gentleman who descended from it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s the Chief of the Surete\u201d he said. \u201cNow we shall see what Frederic\r\n\r\n Larsan has up his sleeve, and whether he is so much cleverer than anybody\r\n\r\n else.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The carriage of the Chief of the Surete was followed by three other\r\n\r\n vehicles containing reporters, who were also desirous of entering the\r\n\r\n park. But two gendarmes stationed at the gate had evidently received\r\n\r\n orders to refuse admission to anybody. The Chief of the Surete calmed\r\n\r\n their impatience by undertaking to furnish to the press, that evening, all\r\n\r\n the information he could give that would not interfere with the judicial\r\n\r\n inquiry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI. In Which Frederic Larsan Explains How the Murderer Was Able to\r\n\r\n Get Out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Among the mass of papers, legal documents, memoirs, and extracts from\r\n\r\n newspapers, which I have collected, relating to the mystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room, there is one very interesting piece; it is a detail of the famous\r\n\r\n examination which took place that afternoon, in the laboratory of\r\n\r\n Professor Stangerson, before the Chief of the Surete. This narrative is\r\n\r\n from the pen of Monsieur Maleine, the Registrar, who, like the examining\r\n\r\n magistrate, had spent some of his leisure time in the pursuit of\r\n\r\n literature. The piece was to have made part of a book which, however, has\r\n\r\n never been published, and which was to have been entitled: \u201cMy\r\n\r\n Examinations.\u201d It was given to me by the Registrar himself, some time\r\n\r\n after the astonishing denouement to this case, and is unique in judicial\r\n\r\n chronicles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Here it is. It is not a mere dry transcription of questions and answers,\r\n\r\n because the Registrar often intersperses his story with his own personal\r\n\r\n comments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The examining magistrate and I (the writer relates) found ourselves in The\r\n\r\n Yellow Room in the company of the builder who had constructed the pavilion\r\n\r\n after Professor Stangerson\u2019s designs. He had a workman with him. Monsieur\r\n\r\n de Marquet had had the walls laid entirely bare; that is to say, he had\r\n\r\n had them stripped of the paper which had decorated them. Blows with a\r\n\r\n pick, here and there, satisfied us of the absence of any sort of opening.\r\n\r\n The floor and the ceiling were thoroughly sounded. We found nothing. There\r\n\r\n was nothing to be found. Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be delighted and\r\n\r\n never ceased repeating:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat a case! What a case! We shall never know, you\u2019ll see, how the\r\n\r\n murderer was able to get out of this room!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Then suddenly, with a radiant face, he called to the officer in charge of\r\n\r\n the gendarmes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cGo to the chateau,\u201d he said, \u201cand request Monsieur Stangerson and\r\n\r\n Monsieur Robert Darzac to come to me in the laboratory, also Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques; and let your men bring here the two concierges.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Five minutes later all were assembled in the laboratory. The Chief of the\r\n\r\n Surete, who had arrived at the Glandier, joined us at that moment.
I was\r\n\r\n seated at Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s desk ready for work, when Monsieur de\r\n\r\n Marquet made us the following little speech\u2014as original as it was\r\n\r\n unexpected:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWith your permission, gentlemen\u2014as examinations lead to nothing\u2014we\r\n\r\n will, for once, abandon the old system of interrogation. I will not have\r\n\r\n you brought before me one by one, but we will all remain here as we are,\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson, Monsieur Robert Darzac, Daddy Jacques and the two concierges,\r\n\r\n the Chief of the Surete, the Registrar, and myself. We shall all be on the\r\n\r\n same footing. The concierges may, for the moment, forget that they have\r\n\r\n been arrested. We are going to confer together. We are on the spot where\r\n\r\n the crime was committed. We have nothing else to discuss but the crime. So\r\n\r\n let us discuss it freely\u2014intelligently or otherwise, so long as we\r\n\r\n speak just what is in our minds. There need be no formality or method\r\n\r\n since this won\u2019t help us in any way.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Then, passing before me, he said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat do you think of that, eh? What a scene! Could you have thought of\r\n\r\n that? I\u2019ll make a little piece out of it for the Vaudeville.\u201d And he\r\n\r\n rubbed his hands with glee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I turned my eyes on Monsieur Stangerson. The hope he had received from the\r\n\r\n doctor\u2019s latest reports, which stated that Mademoiselle Stangerson might\r\n\r\n recover from her wounds, had not been able to efface from his noble\r\n\r\n features the marks of the great sorrow that was upon him. He had believed\r\n\r\n his daughter to be dead, and he was still broken by that belief. His\r\n\r\n clear, soft, blue eyes expressed infinite sorrow. I had had occasion, many\r\n\r\n times, to see Monsieur Stangerson at public ceremonies, and from the first\r\n\r\n had been struck by his countenance, which seemed as pure as that of a\r\n\r\n child\u2014the dreamy gaze with the sublime and mystical expression of\r\n\r\n the inventor and thinker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n On those occasions his daughter was always to be seen either following him\r\n\r\n or by his side; for they never quitted each other, it was said, and had\r\n\r\n shared the same labours for many years. The young lady, who was then five\r\n\r\n and thirty, though she looked no more than thirty, had devoted herself\r\n\r\n entirely to science. She still won admiration for her imperial beauty\r\n\r\n which had remained intact, without a wrinkle, withstanding time and love.\r\n\r\n Who would have dreamed that I should one day be seated by her pillow with\r\n\r\n my papers, and that I should see her, on the point of death, painfully\r\n\r\n recounting to us the most monstrous and most mysterious crime I have heard\r\n\r\n of in my career? Who would have thought that I should be, that afternoon,\r\n\r\n listening to the despairing father vainly trying to explain how his\r\n\r\n daughter\u2019s assailant had been able to escape from him? Why bury ourselves\r\n\r\n with our work in obscure retreats in the depths of woods, if it may not\r\n\r\n protect us against those dangerous threats to life which meet us in the\r\n\r\n busy cities?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNow, Monsieur Stangerson,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet, with somewhat of an\r\n\r\n important air, \u201cplace yourself exactly where you were when Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n Stangerson left you to go to her chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson rose and, standing at a certain distance from the door\r\n\r\n of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, said, in an even voice and without the least trace of\r\n\r\n emphasis\u2014a voice which I can only describe as a dead voice:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI was here. About eleven o\u2019clock, after I had made a brief chemical\r\n\r\n experiment at the furnaces of the laboratory, needing all the space behind\r\n\r\n me, I had my desk moved here by Daddy Jacques, who spent the evening in\r\n\r\n cleaning some of my apparatus. My daughter had been working at the same\r\n\r\n desk with me. When it was her time to leave she rose, kissed me, and bade\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques goodnight. She had to pass behind my desk and the door to\r\n\r\n enter her chamber, and she could do this only with some difficulty.
That\r\n\r\n is to say, I was very near the place where the crime occurred later.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd the desk?\u201d I asked, obeying, in thus mixing myself in the\r\n\r\n conversation, the express orders of my chief, \u201cas soon as you heard the\r\n\r\n cry of \u2018murder\u2019 followed by the revolver shots, what became of the desk?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques answered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe pushed it back against the wall, here\u2014close to where it is at\r\n\r\n the present moment\u2014so as to be able to get at the door at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I followed up my reasoning, to which, however, I attached but little\r\n\r\n importance, regarding it as only a weak hypothesis, with another question.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMight not a man in the room, the desk being so near to the door, by\r\n\r\n stooping and slipping under the desk, have left it unobserved?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou are forgetting,\u201d interrupted Monsieur Stangerson wearily, \u201cthat my\r\n\r\n daughter had locked and bolted her door, that the door had remained\r\n\r\n fastened, that we vainly tried to force it open when we heard the noise,\r\n\r\n and that we were at the door while the struggle between the murderer and\r\n\r\n my poor child was going on\u2014immediately after we heard her stifled\r\n\r\n cries as she was being held by the fingers that have left their red mark\r\n\r\n upon her throat. Rapid as the attack was, we were no less rapid in our\r\n\r\n endeavors to get into the room where the tragedy was taking place.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I rose from my seat and once more examined the door with the greatest\r\n\r\n care. Then I returned to my place with a despairing gesture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf the lower panel of the door,\u201d I said, \u201ccould be removed without the\r\n\r\n whole door being necessarily opened, the problem would be solved. But,\r\n\r\n unfortunately, that last hypothesis is untenable after an examination of\r\n\r\n the door\u2014it\u2019s of oak, solid and massive. You can see that quite\r\n\r\n plainly, in spite of the injury done in the attempt to burst it open.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh!\u201d cried Daddy Jacques, \u201cit is an old and solid door that was brought\r\n\r\n from the chateau\u2014they don\u2019t make such doors now. We had to use this\r\n\r\n bar of iron to get it open, all four of us\u2014for the concierge, brave\r\n\r\n woman she is, helped us. It pains me to find them both in prison now.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques had no sooner uttered these words of pity and protestation\r\n\r\n than tears and lamentations broke out from the concierges. I never saw two\r\n\r\n accused people crying more bitterly. I was extremely disgusted. Even if\r\n\r\n they were innocent, I could not understand how they could behave like that\r\n\r\n in the face of misfortune. A dignified bearing at such times is better\r\n\r\n than tears and groans, which, most often, are feigned.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNow then, enough of that sniveling,\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet; \u201cand, in\r\n\r\n your interest, tell us what you were doing under the windows of the\r\n\r\n pavilion at the time your mistress was being attacked; for you were close\r\n\r\n to the pavilion when Daddy Jacques met you.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWe were coming to help!\u201d they whined.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf we could only lay hands on the murderer, he\u2019d never taste bread\r\n\r\n again!\u201d the woman gurgled between her sobs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n As before we were unable to get two connecting thoughts out of them. They\r\n\r\n persisted in their denials and swore, by heaven and all the saints, that\r\n\r\n they were in bed when they heard the sound of the revolver shot.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt was not one, but two shots that were fired!\u2014You see, you are\r\n\r\n lying. If you had heard one, you would have heard the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMon Dieu! Monsieur\u2014it was the second shot we heard. We were asleep\r\n\r\n when the first shot was fired.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cTwo shots were fired,\u201d said Daddy Jacques. \u201cI am certain that all the\r\n\r\n cartridges were in my revolver. We found afterward that two had been\r\n\r\n exploded, and we heard two shots behind the door.
Was not that so,\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Professor, \u201cthere were two shots, one dull, and the\r\n\r\n other sharp and ringing.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhy do you persist in lying?\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet, turning to the\r\n\r\n concierges. \u201cDo you think the police are the fools you are? Everything\r\n\r\n points to the fact that you were out of doors and near the pavilion at the\r\n\r\n time of the tragedy. What were you doing there? So far as I am concerned,\u201d\r\n\r\n he said, turning to Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cI can only explain the escape of\r\n\r\n the murderer on the assumption of help from these two accomplices. As soon\r\n\r\n as the door was forced open, and while you, Monsieur Stangerson, were\r\n\r\n occupied with your unfortunate child, the concierge and his wife\r\n\r\n facilitated the flight of the murderer, who, screening himself behind\r\n\r\n them, reached the window in the vestibule, and sprang out of it into the\r\n\r\n park. The concierge closed the window after him and fastened the blinds,\r\n\r\n which certainly could not have closed and fastened of themselves. That is\r\n\r\n the conclusion I have arrived at. If anyone here has any other idea, let\r\n\r\n him state it.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson intervened:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat you say was impossible. I do not believe either in the guilt or in\r\n\r\n the connivance of my concierges, though I cannot understand what they were\r\n\r\n doing in the park at that late hour of the night. I say it was impossible,\r\n\r\n because Madame Bernier held the lamp and did not move from the threshold\r\n\r\n of the room; because I, as soon as the door was forced open, threw myself\r\n\r\n on my knees beside my daughter, and no one could have left or entered the\r\n\r\n room by the door, without passing over her body and forcing his way by me!\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques and the concierge had but to cast a glance round the chamber\r\n\r\n and under the bed, as I had done on entering, to see that there was nobody\r\n\r\n in it but my daughter lying on the floor.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat do you think, Monsieur Darzac?\u201d asked the magistrate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Darzac replied that he had no opinion to express. Monsieur Dax,\r\n\r\n the Chief of the Surete who, so far, had been listening and examining the\r\n\r\n room, at length deigned to open his lips:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhile search is being made for the criminal, we had better try to find\r\n\r\n out the motive for the crime; that will advance us a little,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n Turning towards Monsieur Stangerson, he continued, in the even,\r\n\r\n intelligent tone indicative of a strong character, \u201cI understand that\r\n\r\n Mademoiselle was shortly to have been married?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The professor looked sadly at Monsieur Robert Darzac.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cTo my friend here, whom I should have been happy to call my son\u2014to\r\n\r\n Monsieur Robert Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson is much better and is rapidly recovering from her\r\n\r\n wounds. The marriage is simply delayed, is it not, Monsieur?\u201d insisted the\r\n\r\n Chief of the Surete.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI hope so.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat! Is there any doubt about that?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson did not answer. Monsieur Robert Darzac seemed\r\n\r\n agitated. I saw that his hand trembled as it fingered his watchchain.\r\n\r\n Monsieur Dax coughed, as did Monsieur de Marquet. Both were evidently\r\n\r\n embarrassed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou understand, Monsieur Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201cthat in an affair so\r\n\r\n perplexing as this, we cannot neglect anything; we must know all, even the\r\n\r\n smallest and seemingly most futile thing concerning the victim\u2014information\r\n\r\n apparently the most insignificant. Why do you doubt that this marriage\r\n\r\n will take place? You expressed a hope; but the hope implies a doubt. Why\r\n\r\n do you doubt?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson made a visible effort to recover himself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou are right. It will be best that\r\n\r\n you should know something which, if I concealed it, might appear to be of\r\n\r\n importance; Monsieur Darzac agrees with me in this.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Darzac, whose pallor at that moment seemed to me to be altogether\r\n\r\n abnormal, made a sign of assent.
I gathered he was unable to speak.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI want you to know then,\u201d continued Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cthat my\r\n\r\n daughter has sworn never to leave me, and adheres firmly to her oath, in\r\n\r\n spite of all my prayers and all that I have argued to induce her to marry.\r\n\r\n We have known Monsieur Robert Darzac many years. He loves my child; and I\r\n\r\n believed that she loved him; because she only recently consented to this\r\n\r\n marriage which I desire with all my heart. I am an old man, Monsieur, and\r\n\r\n it was a happy hour to me when I knew that, after I had gone, she would\r\n\r\n have at her side, one who loved her and who would help her in continuing\r\n\r\n our common labours. I love and esteem Monsieur Darzac both for his\r\n\r\n greatness of heart and for his devotion to science. But, two days before\r\n\r\n the tragedy, for I know not what reason, my daughter declared to me that\r\n\r\n she would never marry Monsieur Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n A dead silence followed Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s words. It was a moment\r\n\r\n fraught with suspense.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDid Mademoiselle give you any explanation,\u2014did she tell you what\r\n\r\n her motive was?\u201d asked Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cShe told me she was too old to marry\u2014that she had waited too long.\r\n\r\n She said she had given much thought to the matter and while she had a\r\n\r\n great esteem, even affection, for Monsieur Darzac, she felt it would be\r\n\r\n better if things remained as they were. She would be happy, she said, to\r\n\r\n see the relations between ourselves and Monsieur Darzac become closer, but\r\n\r\n only on the understanding that there would be no more talk of marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat is very strange!\u201d muttered Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cStrange!\u201d repeated Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou\u2019ll certainly not find the motive there, Monsieur Dax,\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson said with a cold smile.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIn any case, the motive was not theft!\u201d said the Chief impatiently.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOh! we are quite convinced of that!\u201d cried the examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n At that moment the door of the laboratory opened and the officer in charge\r\n\r\n of the gendarmes entered and handed a card to the examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet read it and uttered a half angry exclamation:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThis is really too much!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the Chief.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt\u2019s the card of a young reporter engaged on the \u2018Epoque,\u2019 a Monsieur\r\n\r\n Joseph Rouletabille. It has these words written on it: \u2018One of the motives\r\n\r\n of the crime was robbery.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The Chief smiled.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh,\u2014young Rouletabille\u2014I\u2019ve heard of him he is considered\r\n\r\n rather clever. Let him come in.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille was allowed to enter. I had made his\r\n\r\n acquaintance in the train that morning on the way to Epinay-sur-Orge. He\r\n\r\n had introduced himself almost against my wish into our compartment. I had\r\n\r\n better say at once that his manners, and the arrogance with which he\r\n\r\n assumed to know what was incomprehensible even to us, impressed him\r\n\r\n unfavourably on my mind. I do not like journalists. They are a class of\r\n\r\n writers to be avoided as the pest. They think that everything is\r\n\r\n permissible and they respect nothing. Grant them the least favour, allow\r\n\r\n them even to approach you, and you never can tell what annoyance they may\r\n\r\n give you. This one appears to be scarcely twenty years old, and the\r\n\r\n effrontery with which he dared to question us and discuss the matter with\r\n\r\n us made him particularly obnoxious to me. Besides, he had a way of\r\n\r\n expressing himself that left us guessing as to whether he was mocking us\r\n\r\n or not. I know quite well that the \u2018Epoque\u2019 is an influential paper with\r\n\r\n which it is well to be on good terms, but the paper ought not to allow\r\n\r\n itself to be represented by sneaking reporters.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille entered the laboratory, bowed to us, and\r\n\r\n waited for Monsieur de Marquet to ask him to explain his presence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou pretend, Monsieur, that you know the motive for the crime, and that\r\n\r\n that motive\u2014in the face of all the evidence that has been\r\n\r\n forthcoming\u2014was robbery?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cNo, Monsieur, I do not pretend that.
I do not say that robbery was the\r\n\r\n motive for the crime, and I don\u2019t believe it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen, what is the meaning of this card?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt means that robbery was one of the motives for the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat leads you to think that?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf you will be good enough to accompany me, I will show you.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The young man asked us to follow him into the vestibule, and we did. He\r\n\r\n led us towards the lavatory and begged Monsieur de Marquet to kneel beside\r\n\r\n him. This lavatory is lit by the glass door, and, when the door was open,\r\n\r\n the light which penetrated was sufficient to light it perfectly. Monsieur\r\n\r\n de Marquet and Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille knelt down on the threshold,\r\n\r\n and the young man pointed to a spot on the pavement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe stones of the lavatory have not been washed by Daddy Jacques for some\r\n\r\n time,\u201d he said; \u201cthat can be seen by the layer of dust that covers them.\r\n\r\n Now, notice here, the marks of two large footprints and the black ash they\r\n\r\n left where they have been. That ash is nothing else than the charcoal dust\r\n\r\n that covers the path along which you must pass through the forest, in\r\n\r\n order to get directly from Epinay to the Glandier. You know there is a\r\n\r\n little village of charcoal-burners at that place, who make large\r\n\r\n quantities of charcoal. What the murderer did was to come here at midday,\r\n\r\n when there was nobody at the pavilion, and attempt his robbery.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cBut what robbery?\u2014Where do you see any signs of robbery? What\r\n\r\n proves to you that a robbery has been committed?\u201d we all cried at once.\r\n\r\n \u201cWhat put me on the trace of it,\u201d continued the journalist...\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWas this?\u201d interrupted Monsieur de Marquet, still on his knees.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cEvidently,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And Monsieur de Marquet explained that there were on the dust of the\r\n\r\n pavement marks of two footsteps, as well as the impression, freshly-made,\r\n\r\n of a heavy rectangular parcel, the marks of the cord with which it had\r\n\r\n been fastened being easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYou have been here, then, Monsieur Rouletabille? I thought I had given\r\n\r\n orders to Daddy Jacques, who was left in charge of the pavilion, not to\r\n\r\n allow anybody to enter.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t scold Daddy Jacques, I came here with Monsieur Robert Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh,\u2014Indeed!\u201d exclaimed Monsieur de Marquet, disagreeably, casting a\r\n\r\n side-glance at Monsieur Darzac, who remained perfectly silent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhen I saw the mark of the parcel by the side of the footprints, I had no\r\n\r\n doubt as to the robbery,\u201d replied Monsieur Rouletabille. \u201cThe thief had\r\n\r\n not brought a parcel with him; he had made one here\u2014a parcel with\r\n\r\n the stolen objects, no doubt; and he put it in this corner intending to\r\n\r\n take it away when the moment came for him to make his escape. He had also\r\n\r\n placed his heavy boots beside the parcel,\u2014for, see\u2014there are\r\n\r\n no marks of steps leading to the marks left by the boots, which were\r\n\r\n placed side by side. That accounts for the fact that the murderer left no\r\n\r\n trace of his steps when he fled from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, nor any in the\r\n\r\n laboratory, nor in the vestibule. After entering \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d in his\r\n\r\n boots, he took them off, finding them troublesome, or because he wished to\r\n\r\n make as little noise as possible. The marks made by him in going through\r\n\r\n the vestibule and the laboratory were subsequently washed out by Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques. Having, for some reason or other, taken off his boots, the\r\n\r\n murderer carried them in his hand and placed them by the side of the\r\n\r\n parcel he had made,\u2014by that time the robbery had been accomplished.\r\n\r\n The man then returned to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and slipped under the bed, where\r\n\r\n the mark of his body is perfectly visible on the floor and even on the\r\n\r\n mat, which has been slightly moved from its place and creased. Fragments\r\n\r\n of straw also, recently torn, bear witness to the murderer\u2019s movements\r\n\r\n under the bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes, yes,\u2014we know all about that,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe robber had another motive for returning to hide under the bed,\u201d\r\n\r\n continued the astonishing boy-journalist.
\u201cYou might think that he was\r\n\r\n trying to hide himself quickly on seeing, through the vestibule window,\r\n\r\n Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson about to enter the pavilion. It would\r\n\r\n have been much easier for him to have climbed up to the attic and hidden\r\n\r\n there, waiting for an opportunity to get away, if his purpose had been\r\n\r\n only flight.\u2014No! No!\u2014he had to be in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Here the Chief intervened.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s not at all bad, young man. I compliment you. If we do not know yet\r\n\r\n how the murderer succeeded in getting away, we can at any rate see how he\r\n\r\n came in and committed the robbery. But what did he steal?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cSomething very valuable,\u201d replied the young reporter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n At that moment we heard a cry from the laboratory. We rushed in and found\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson, his eyes haggard, his limbs trembling, pointing to a\r\n\r\n sort of bookcase which he had opened, and which, we saw, was empty. At the\r\n\r\n same instant he sank into the large armchair that was placed before the\r\n\r\n desk and groaned, the tears rolling down his cheeks, \u201cI have been robbed\r\n\r\n again! For God\u2019s sake, do not say a word of this to my daughter. She would\r\n\r\n be more pained than I am.\u201d He heaved a deep sigh and added, in a tone I\r\n\r\n shall never forget: \u201cAfter all, what does it matter,\u2014so long as she\r\n\r\n lives!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cShe will live!\u201d said Monsieur Darzac, in a voice strangely touching.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd we will find the stolen articles,\u201d said Monsieur Dax. \u201cBut what was\r\n\r\n in the cabinet?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cTwenty years of my life,\u201d replied the illustrious professor sadly, \u201cor\r\n\r\n rather of our lives\u2014the lives of myself and my daughter! Yes, our\r\n\r\n most precious documents, the records of our secret experiments and our\r\n\r\n labours of twenty years were in that cabinet. It is an irreparable loss to\r\n\r\n us and, I venture to say, to science. All the processes by which I had\r\n\r\n been able to arrive at the precious proof of the destructibility of matter\r\n\r\n were there\u2014all. The man who came wished to take all from me,\u2014my\r\n\r\n daughter and my work\u2014my heart and my soul.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And the great scientist wept like a child.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We stood around him in silence, deeply affected by his great distress.\r\n\r\n Monsieur Darzac pressed closely to his side, and tried in vain to restrain\r\n\r\n his tears\u2014a sight which, for the moment, almost made me like him, in\r\n\r\n spite of an instinctive repulsion which his strange demeanour and his\r\n\r\n inexplicable anxiety had inspired me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Rouletabille alone,\u2014as if his precious time and mission on\r\n\r\n earth did not permit him to dwell in the contemplation on human suffering\u2014had,\r\n\r\n very calmly, stepped up to the empty cabinet and, pointing at it, broke\r\n\r\n the almost solemn silence. He entered into explanations, for which there\r\n\r\n was no need, as to why he had been led to believe that a robbery had been\r\n\r\n committed, which included the simultaneous discovery he had made in the\r\n\r\n lavatory, and the empty precious cabinet in the laboratory. The first\r\n\r\n thing that had struck him, he said, was the unusual form of that piece of\r\n\r\n furniture. It was very strongly built of fire-proof iron, clearly showing\r\n\r\n that it was intended for the keeping of most valuable objects. Then he\r\n\r\n noticed that the key had been left in the lock. \u201cOne does not ordinarily\r\n\r\n have a safe and leave it open!\u201d he had said to himself. This little key,\r\n\r\n with its brass head and complicated wards, had strongly attracted him,\u2014its\r\n\r\n presence had suggested robbery.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be greatly perplexed, as if he did not\r\n\r\n know whether he ought to be glad of the new direction given to the inquiry\r\n\r\n by the young reporter, or sorry that it had not been done by himself. In\r\n\r\n our profession and for the general welfare, we have to put up with such\r\n\r\n mortifications and bury selfish feelings.
That was why Monsieur de Marquet\r\n\r\n controlled himself and joined his compliments with those of Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n As for Monsieur Rouletabille, he simply shrugged his shoulders and said:\r\n\r\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at all in that!\u201d I should have liked to box his ears,\r\n\r\n especially when he added: \u201cYou will do well, Monsieur, to ask Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson who usually kept that key?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMy daughter,\u201d replied Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cshe was never without it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAh! then that changes the aspect of things which no longer corresponds\r\n\r\n with Monsieur Rouletabille\u2019s ideas!\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet. \u201cIf that\r\n\r\n key never left Mademoiselle Stangerson, the murderer must have waited for\r\n\r\n her in her room for the purpose of stealing it; and the robbery could not\r\n\r\n have been committed until after the attack had been made on her. But after\r\n\r\n the attack four persons were in the laboratory! I can\u2019t make it out!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThe robbery,\u201d said the reporter, \u201ccould only have been committed before\r\n\r\n the attack upon Mademoiselle Stangerson in her room. When the murderer\r\n\r\n entered the pavilion he already possessed the brass-headed key.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat is impossible,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson in a low voice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt is quite possible, Monsieur, as this proves.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n And the young rascal drew a copy of the \u201cEpoque\u201d from his pocket, dated\r\n\r\n the 21st of October (I recall the fact that the crime was committed on the\r\n\r\n night between the 24th and 25th), and showing us an advertisement, he\r\n\r\n read:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201c\u2018Yesterday a black satin reticule was lost in the Grands Magasins de la\r\n\r\n Louvre. It contained, amongst other things, a small key with a brass head.\r\n\r\n A handsome reward will be given to the person who has found it. This\r\n\r\n person must write, poste restante, bureau 40, to this address: M. A. T. H.\r\n\r\n S. N.\u2019 Do not these letters suggest Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d continued\r\n\r\n the reporter. \u201cThe \u2018key with a brass head\u2019\u2014is not this the key? I\r\n\r\n always read advertisements. In my business, as in yours, Monsieur, one\r\n\r\n should always read the personals.\u2019 They are often the keys to intrigues,\r\n\r\n that are not always brass-headed, but which are none the less interesting.\r\n\r\n This advertisement interested me specially; the woman of the key\r\n\r\n surrounded it with a kind of mystery. Evidently she valued the key, since\r\n\r\n she promised a big reward for its restoration! And I thought on these six\r\n\r\n letters: M. A. T. H. S. N. The first four at once pointed to a Christian\r\n\r\n name; evidently I said Math is Mathilde. But I could make nothing of the\r\n\r\n two last letters. So I threw the journal aside and occupied myself with\r\n\r\n other matters. Four days later, when the evening paper appeared with\r\n\r\n enormous head-lines announcing the murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson, the\r\n\r\n letters in the advertisement mechanically recurred to me. I had forgotten\r\n\r\n the two last letters, S. N. When I saw them again I could not help\r\n\r\n exclaiming, \u2018Stangerson!\u2019 I jumped into a cab and rushed into the bureau\r\n\r\n No. 40, asking: \u2018Have you a letter addressed to M. A. T. H. S. N.?\u2019 The\r\n\r\n clerk replied that he had not. I insisted, begged and entreated him to\r\n\r\n search. He wanted to know if I were playing a joke on him, and then told\r\n\r\n me that he had had a letter with the initials M. A. T. H. S. N, but he had\r\n\r\n given it up three days ago, to a lady who came for it. \u2018You come to-day to\r\n\r\n claim the letter, and the day before yesterday another gentleman claimed\r\n\r\n it! I\u2019ve had enough of this,\u2019 he concluded angrily. I tried to question\r\n\r\n him as to the two persons who had already claimed the letter; but whether\r\n\r\n he wished to entrench himself behind professional secrecy,\u2014he may\r\n\r\n have thought that he had already said too much,\u2014or whether he was\r\n\r\n disgusted at the joke that had been played on him\u2014he would not\r\n\r\n answer any of my questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Rouletabille paused. We all remained silent. Each drew his own conclusions\r\n\r\n from the strange story of the poste restante letter. It seemed, indeed,\r\n\r\n that we now had a thread by means of which we should be able to follow up\r\n\r\n this extraordinary mystery.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThen it is almost certain,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cthat my daughter\r\n\r\n did lose the key, and that she did not tell me of it, wishing to spare any\r\n\r\n anxiety, and that she begged whoever had found it to write to the poste\r\n\r\n restante.
She evidently feared that, by giving our address, inquiries\r\n\r\n would have resulted that would have apprised me of the loss of the key. It\r\n\r\n was quite logical, quite natural for her to have taken that course\u2014for\r\n\r\n I have been robbed once before.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cWhere was that, and when?\u201d asked the Chief of the Surete.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cOh! many years ago, in America, in Philadelphia. There were stolen from\r\n\r\n my laboratory the drawings of two inventions that might have made the\r\n\r\n fortune of a man. Not only have I never learnt who the thief was, but I\r\n\r\n have never heard even a word of the object of the robbery, doubtless\r\n\r\n because, in order to defeat the plans of the person who had robbed me, I\r\n\r\n myself brought these two inventions before the public, and so rendered the\r\n\r\n robbery of no avail. From that time on I have been very careful to shut\r\n\r\n myself in when I am at work. The bars to these windows, the lonely\r\n\r\n situation of this pavilion, this cabinet, which I had specially\r\n\r\n constructed, this special lock, this unique key, all are precautions\r\n\r\n against fears inspired by a sad experience.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cMost interesting!\u201d remarked Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur Rouletabille asked about the reticule. Neither Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson nor Daddy Jacques had seen it for several days, but a few hours\r\n\r\n later we learned from Mademoiselle Stangerson herself that the reticule\r\n\r\n had either been stolen from her, or she had lost it. She further\r\n\r\n corroborated all that had passed just as her father had stated. She had\r\n\r\n gone to the poste restante and, on the 23rd of October, had received a\r\n\r\n letter which, she affirmed, contained nothing but a vulgar pleasantry,\r\n\r\n which she had immediately burned.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n To return to our examination, or rather to our conversation. I must state\r\n\r\n that the Chief of the Surete having inquired of Monsieur Stangerson under\r\n\r\n what conditions his daughter had gone to Paris on the 20th of October, we\r\n\r\n learned that Monsieur Robert Darzac had accompanied her, and Darzac had\r\n\r\n not been again seen at the chateau from that time to the day after the\r\n\r\n crime had been committed. The fact that Monsieur Darzac was with her in\r\n\r\n the Grands Magasins de la Louvre when the reticule disappeared could not\r\n\r\n pass unnoticed, and, it must be said, strongly awakened our interest.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n This conversation between magistrates, accused, victim, witnesses and\r\n\r\n journalist, was coming to a close when quite a theatrical sensation\u2014an\r\n\r\n incident of a kind displeasing to Monsieur de Marquet\u2014was produced.\r\n\r\n The officer of the gendarmes came to announce that Frederic Larsan\r\n\r\n requested to be admitted,\u2014a request that was at once complied with.\r\n\r\n He held in his hand a heavy pair of muddy boots, which he threw on the\r\n\r\n pavement of the laboratory.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201care the boots worn by the murderer. Do you recognise\r\n\r\n them, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Daddy Jacques bent over them and, stupefied, recognised a pair of old\r\n\r\n boots which he had, some time back, thrown into a corner of his attic. He\r\n\r\n was so taken aback that he could not hide his agitation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Then pointing to the handkerchief in the old man\u2019s hand, Frederic Larsan\r\n\r\n said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s a handkerchief astonishingly like the one found in The Yellow\r\n\r\n Room.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI know,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, trembling, \u201cthey are almost alike.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cAnd then,\u201d continued Frederic Larsan, \u201cthe old Basque cap also found in\r\n\r\n \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d might at one time have been worn by Daddy Jacques himself.\r\n\r\n All this, gentlemen, proves, I think, that the murderer wished to disguise\r\n\r\n his real personality. He did it in a very clumsy way\u2014or, at least,\r\n\r\n so it appears to us. Don\u2019t be alarmed, Daddy Jacques; we are quite sure\r\n\r\n that you were not the murderer; you never left the side of Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson. But if Monsieur Stangerson had not been working that night and\r\n\r\n had gone back to the chateau after parting with his daughter, and Daddy\r\n\r\n Jacques had gone to sleep in his attic, no one would have doubted that he\r\n\r\n was the murderer. He owes his safety, therefore, to the tragedy having\r\n\r\n been enacted too soon,\u2014the murderer, no doubt, from the silence in\r\n\r\n the laboratory, imagined that it was empty, and that the moment for action\r\n\r\n had come. The man who had been able to introduce himself here so\r\n\r\n mysteriously and to leave so many evidences against Daddy Jacques, was,\r\n\r\n there can be no doubt, familiar with the house. At what hour exactly he\r\n\r\n entered, whether in the afternoon or in the evening, I cannot say.
One\r\n\r\n familiar with the proceedings and persons of this pavilion could choose\r\n\r\n his own time for entering \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHe could not have entered it if anybody had been in the laboratory,\u201d said\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHow do we know that?\u201d replied Larsan. \u201cThere was the dinner in the\r\n\r\n laboratory, the coming and going of the servants in attendance. There was\r\n\r\n a chemical experiment being carried on between ten and eleven o\u2019clock,\r\n\r\n with Monsieur Stangerson, his daughter, and Daddy Jacques engaged at the\r\n\r\n furnace in a corner of the high chimney. Who can say that the murderer\u2014an\r\n\r\n intimate!\u2014a friend!\u2014did not take advantage of that moment to\r\n\r\n slip into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, after having taken off his boots in the\r\n\r\n lavatory?\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIt is very improbable,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cDoubtless\u2014but it is not impossible. I assert nothing. As to the\r\n\r\n escape from the pavilion\u2014that\u2019s another thing, the most natural\r\n\r\n thing in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n For a moment Frederic Larsan paused,\u2014a moment that appeared to us a\r\n\r\n very long time. The eagerness with which we awaited what he was going to\r\n\r\n tell us may be imagined.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI have not been in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I take it for\r\n\r\n granted that you have satisfied yourselves that he could have left the\r\n\r\n room only by way of the door; it is by the door, then, that the murderer\r\n\r\n made his way out. At what time? At the moment when it was most easy for\r\n\r\n him to do so; at the moment when it became most explainable\u2014so\r\n\r\n completely explainable that there can be no other explanation. Let us go\r\n\r\n over the moments which followed after the crime had been committed. There\r\n\r\n was the first moment, when Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques were\r\n\r\n close to the door, ready to bar the way. There was the second moment,\r\n\r\n during which Daddy Jacques was absent and Monsieur Stangerson was left\r\n\r\n alone before the door. There was a third moment, when Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n was joined by the concierge. There was a fourth moment, during which\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson, the concierge and his wife and Daddy Jacques were\r\n\r\n before the door. There was a fifth moment, during which the door was burst\r\n\r\n open and \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d entered. The moment at which the flight is\r\n\r\n explainable is the very moment when there was the least number of persons\r\n\r\n before the door. There was one moment when there was but one person,\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson. Unless a complicity of silence on the part of Daddy Jacques is\r\n\r\n admitted\u2014in which I do not believe\u2014the door was opened in the\r\n\r\n presence of Monsieur Stangerson alone and the man escaped.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cHere we must admit that Monsieur Stangerson had powerful reasons for not\r\n\r\n arresting, or not causing the arrest of the murderer, since he allowed him\r\n\r\n to reach the window in the vestibule and closed it after him!\u2014That\r\n\r\n done, Mademoiselle Stangerson, though horribly wounded, had still strength\r\n\r\n enough, and no doubt in obedience to the entreaties of her father, to\r\n\r\n refasten the door of her chamber, with both the bolt and the lock, before\r\n\r\n sinking on the floor. We do not know who committed the crime; we do not\r\n\r\n know of what wretch Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson are the victims,\r\n\r\n but there is no doubt that they both know! The secret must be a terrible\r\n\r\n one, for the father had not hesitated to leave his daughter to die behind\r\n\r\n a door which she had shut upon herself,\u2014terrible for him to have\r\n\r\n allowed the assassin to escape. For there is no other way in the world to\r\n\r\n explain the murderer\u2019s flight from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The silence which followed this dramatic and lucid explanation was\r\n\r\n appalling. We all of us felt grieved for the illustrious professor, driven\r\n\r\n into a corner by the pitiless logic of Frederic Larsan, forced to confess\r\n\r\n the whole truth of his martyrdom or to keep silent, and thus make a yet\r\n\r\n more terrible admission. The man himself, a veritable statue of sorrow,\r\n\r\n raised his hand with a gesture so solemn that we bowed our heads to it as\r\n\r\n before something sacred.
He then pronounced these words, in a voice so\r\n\r\n loud that it seemed to exhaust him:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI swear by the head of my suffering child that I never for an instant\r\n\r\n left the door of her chamber after hearing her cries for help; that that\r\n\r\n door was not opened while I was alone in the laboratory; and that,\r\n\r\n finally, when we entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, my three domestics and I, the\r\n\r\n murderer was no longer there! I swear I do not know the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Must I say it,\u2014in spite of the solemnity of Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s\r\n\r\n words, we did not believe in his denial. Frederic Larsan had shown us the\r\n\r\n truth and it was not so easily given up.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Monsieur de Marquet announced that the conversation was at an end, and as\r\n\r\n we were about to leave the laboratory, Joseph Rouletabille approached\r\n\r\n Monsieur Stangerson, took him by the hand with the greatest respect, and I\r\n\r\n heard him say:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cI believe you, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I here close the citation which I have thought it my duty to make from\r\n\r\n Monsieur Maleine\u2019s narrative. I need not tell the reader that all that\r\n\r\n passed in the laboratory was immediately and faithfully reported to me by\r\n\r\n Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XII. Frederic Larsan\u2019s Cane\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n It was not till six o\u2019clock that I left the chateau, taking with me the\r\n\r\n article hastily written by my friend in the little sitting-room which\r\n\r\n Monsieur Robert Darzac had placed at our disposal. The reporter was to\r\n\r\n sleep at the chateau, taking advantage of the to me inexplicable\r\n\r\n hospitality offered him by Monsieur Robert Darzac, to whom Monsieur\r\n\r\n Stangerson, in that sad time, left the care of all his domestic affairs.\r\n\r\n Nevertheless he insisted on accompanying me to the station at Epinay. In\r\n\r\n crossing the park, he said to me:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cFrederic is really very clever and has not belied his reputation. Do you\r\n\r\n know how he came to find Daddy Jacques\u2019s boots?\u2014Near the spot where\r\n\r\n we noticed the traces of the neat boots and the disappearance of the rough\r\n\r\n ones, there was a square hole, freshly made in the moist ground, where a\r\n\r\n stone had evidently been removed. Larsan searched for that stone without\r\n\r\n finding it, and at once imagined that it had been used by the murderer\r\n\r\n with which to sink the boots in the lake. Fred\u2019s calculation was an\r\n\r\n excellent one, as the success of his search proves. That escaped me; but\r\n\r\n my mind was turned in another direction by the large number of false\r\n\r\n indications of his track which the murderer left, and by the measure of\r\n\r\n the black foot-marks corresponding with that of Daddy Jacques\u2019s boots,\r\n\r\n which I had established without his suspecting it, on the floor of The\r\n\r\n Yellow Room. All which was a proof, in my eyes, that the murderer had\r\n\r\n sought to turn suspicion on to the old servant. Up to that point, Larsan\r\n\r\n and I are in accord; but no further. It is going to be a terrible matter;\r\n\r\n for I tell you he is working on wrong lines, and I\u2014I, must fight him\r\n\r\n with nothing!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I was surprised at the profoundly grave accent with which my young friend\r\n\r\n pronounced the last words.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He repeated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cYes\u2014terrible!\u2014terrible! For it is fighting with nothing, when you\r\n\r\n have only an idea to fight with.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n At that moment we passed by the back of the chateau. Night had come. A\r\n\r\n window on the first floor was partly open. A feeble light came from it as\r\n\r\n well as some sounds which drew our attention. We approached until we had\r\n\r\n reached the side of a door that was situated just under the window.\r\n\r\n Rouletabille, in a low tone, made me understand, that this was the window\r\n\r\n of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber. The sounds which had attracted our\r\n\r\n attention ceased, then were renewed for a moment, and then we heard\r\n\r\n stifled sobs. We were only able to catch these words, which reached us\r\n\r\n distinctly: \u201cMy poor Robert!\u201d\u2014Rouletabille whispered in my ear:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \u201cIf we only knew what was being said in that chamber, my inquiry would\r\n\r\n soon be finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n He looked about him. The darkness of the evening enveloped us; we could\r\n\r\n not see much beyond the narrow path bordered by trees, which ran behind\r\n\r\n the chateau.
