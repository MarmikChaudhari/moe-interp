\section{Introduction}
Recent advances in NISQ devices have demonstrated both promise and limitations in quantum computation. 
The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to
address noise in NISQ devices while preserving gate fidelity.
In the context of quantum error correction, this scaling function is a generalization of the 
$X$ gate depolarizing channel used in the surface code~\cite{kitaev1997fault}.
In this work, we apply this channel scaling framework to the single-qubit Clifford group, 
which is a natural choice for a fault-tolerant quantum computer.
We show that this scaling function can be used to mitigate noise in NISQ devices,
which can be incorporated into a quantum error correction protocol.

In the context of a noisy quantum computer, we can measure the fidelity of a quantum state $\rho$ 
with respect to a target state $\sigma$ as

The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$

\section{Method}
We propose a scaling framework for quantum channels that preserves gate fidelity while reducing environmental noise.
We first define the fidelity of a quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$ as 
\begin{equation}
    F(\mathcal{N}) = \tr(\mathcal{N}\rho^2),
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is a quantum state. 
For a quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$, the fidelity is monotonically decreasing

In this paper, we provide a framework for quantum error mitigation in NISQ devices.
Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is a well-established method for reducing the effects of noise and error in quantum 
computation \cite{nielsen2010quantum,zhu2018quantum,vanderstraaten2019scalable}. 
QEM is particularly useful for NISQ devices, which have limited coherence times and are subject to high levels of noise and error. 
The main idea behind QEM is to use ancillary quantum systems to correct for the effects of the noise. 
This can be done in several different ways, but the most common approach is to use a classical

Quantum computers are error-prone devices that perform quantum operations 
on quantum bits (qubits) using gates with limited fidelity.
We consider a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device with $q$ qubits. 
A quantum operation is represented by a unitary matrix $U$, 
which is applied to the state of the system. 
A single qubit operation $U_q$ is composed of $q$ single qubit operations $U_q(t) = U_1(t
