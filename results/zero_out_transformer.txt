\title{Quantum Error Mitigation in NISQ Devices}
\begin{abstract}
We present a novel approach to error mitigation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. 
Our method introduces a scaling framework for quantum channels that preserves gate fidelity while reducing environmental noise.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Recent advances in NISQ devices have demonstrated both promise and limitations in quantum computation. 
The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to
reduce errors caused by environmental noise. 
We show how to use a scaling framework to design quantum operations that can be implemented on NISQ devices. 
We develop a novel approach to error mitigation in NISQ devices that preserves gate fidelity while reducing environmental noise.

The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to
reduce decoherence while ensuring channel fidelity. 
We use $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ to denote the average number of errors introduced by each gate in a quantum operation. 
Our scaling approach is based on the idea that the error probability distribution of a quantum channel can be expressed as a product of two 
independent and independent terms. 
The first term is the channel average error probability $\mathcal{P}(\rho)$ and the second term is the error probability distribution 
$\mathcal

\begin{aligned}
\frac{\rho}{\lambda} & = & e^{-\lambda t}\rho \\
\frac{\rho}{\lambda} & = & e^{-\lambda t}\rho + \frac{\rho}{\lambda}

The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to
reduce the error rate of a noisy $\rho$ quantum channel.
Our approach is based on a general quantum channel scaling framework 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
and the corresponding scaling $\mathcal{C}(t)$ 
$\mathcal{C}(t)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\rho^2}} \lambda^2t$
