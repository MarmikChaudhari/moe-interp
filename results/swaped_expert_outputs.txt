\title{Quantum Error Mitigation in NISQ Devices}
\begin{abstract}
We present a novel approach to error mitigation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. 
Our method introduces a scaling framework for quantum channels that preserves gate fidelity while reducing environmental noise.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Recent advances in NISQ devices have demonstrated both promise and limitations in quantum computation. 
The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
ho$ = e^{-\lambda t}
that provides a systematic way to
reduce the effect of decoherence.
This scaling approach is based on the idea
that the effective decoherence rate $\lambda t$
can be reduced by increasing the number of qubits $N$.
As a result, $N$ can be viewed as a scaling parameter that determines the desired noise level for a quantum channel.
To illustrate the concept, consider a simple NISQ quantum channel
\begin{align}
\label{eq:channel}
ho = {\rm{diag}}(t_0,t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4) \otimes \rho,
\end{align}
where $t_0,t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4$

\section{Introduction}
Recent advances in NISQ devices have demonstrated both promise and limitations in quantum computation. 
The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to
mitigate noise in a quantum system.
As a result, we show that the
error rate of a quantum operation is reduced to the error rate of a classical operation in a noisy
channel, $\epsilon \rightarrow \epsilon e^{-\lambda t}$, where $\epsilon$ is the error rate of a quantum operation and $\epsilon e^{-\lambda t}$ is the error rate of a classical operation. 
This scaling approach to error mitigation allows us to reduce the error rate of a quantum operation without decreasing the gate fidelity as the gate time is increased.

In this article, we present a scaling framework for quantum channels that preserves gate fidelity while reducing environmental noise.
Our method introduces a scaling factor $\lambda$ that allows us to decrease environmental noise by a factor of $e^{-\lambda t}$ while maintaining gate fidelity.
The scaling factor is determined by the quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$ and the environment $E$, and

\section{Introduction}
Recent advances in NISQ devices have demonstrated both promise and limitations in quantum computation. 
The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to
mitigate these errors by controlling the time scale of decoherence. 
We show that the resulting quantum channel is a special case of a general class of channels that can be used to 
mitigate decoherence. 
We demonstrate that this approach is effective in mitigating the effects of decoherence. 
Our results show that the channel scaling approach can be used to effectively mitigate decoherence in NISQ devices.

\section{Channels}

We consider the effects of decoherence on a quantum channel $\mathcal{C}(\rho)$ acting on a quantum system $A$ 
with Hilbert space dimension $d$,

\section{Introduction}

The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to
reduce the effects of decoherence in quantum systems
and improve the fidelity of quantum gates. 
Our approach provides a framework for scaling quantum channels while preserving gate fidelity. 
We apply our method to a two-qubit system and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a systematic study of 
gate-fidelity scaling and fidelity-scaling noise-reduction.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Fidelity-Scaling Error Mitigation}
We introduce a scaling framework for quantum channels that preserves gate fidelity while reducing environmental noise.
We first introduce the two-qubit gate and its gate-fidelity scaling. 
Since our goal is to mitigate the effects of decoherence, we need to quantify the amount of environmental noise.
