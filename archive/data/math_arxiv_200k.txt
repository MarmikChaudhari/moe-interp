This is a missing chapter from Hans Magnus Enzensberger's mathematical
adventure The Number Devil (Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1997). In the
book, a math-hating boy named Robert is visited in his dreams by the clever
Number Devil, who teaches him to love all things numerical. However, we all
forget our dreams from time to time. Here is one adventure that Enzensberger
overlooked, where the Number Devil introduces Robert to geometry not-of-Euclid,
great circles, parallel transport, the pendulum of Foucault, and the genius of
Euler.

In the stability analysis of an equilibrium, given by a stationary point of a
functional F[n] (free energy functional, e.g.), the second derivative of F[n]
plays the essential role. If the system in equilibrium is subject to the
conservation constraint of some extensive property (e.g. volume, material, or
energy conservation), the Euler equation determining the stationary point
corresponding to the equilibrium alters according to the method of Lagrange
multipliers. Here, the question as to how the effects of constraints can be
taken into account in a stability analysis based on second functional
derivatives is examined. It is shown that the concept of constrained second
derivatives incorporates all the effects due to constraints; therefore
constrained second derivatives provide the proper tool for the stability
analysis of equilibria under constraints. For a physically important type of
constraints, it is demonstrated how the presented theory works. Further, the
rigorous derivation of a recently obtained stability condition for a special
case of equilibrium of ultrathin-film binary mixtures is given, presenting a
guide for similar analyses. [For details on constrained derivatives, see also

Quantum mechanics is difficult to learn because it is counterintuitive, hard
to visualize, mathematically challenging, and abstract. The Physics Education
Technology (PhET) Project, known for its interactive computer simulations for
teaching and learning physics, now includes 18 simulations on quantum mechanics
designed to improve learning of this difficult subject. Our simulations include
several key features to help students build mental models and intuitions about
quantum mechanics: visual representations of abstract concepts and microscopic
processes that cannot be directly observed, interactive environments that
directly couple students' actions to animations, connections to everyday life,
and efficient calculations so students can focus on the concepts rather than
the math. Like all PhET simulations, these are developed using the results of
education research and feedback from educators, and are tested in student
interviews and classroom studies. This article provides an overview of the PhET
quantum simulations and their development. We also describe research
demonstrating their effectiveness and share some insights about student
thinking that we have gained from our research on quantum simulations.

Daganzo's criticisms of second-order fluid approximations of traffic flow [C.
Daganzo, Transpn. Res. B. 29, 277-286 (1995)] and Aw and Rascle's proposal how
to overcome them [A. Aw and M. Rascle, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 60, 916-938 (2000)]
have stimulated an intensive scientific activity in the field of traffic
modeling. Here, we will revisit their arguments and the interpretations behind
them. We will start by analyzing the linear stability of traffic models, which
is a widely established approach to study the ability of traffic models to
describe emergent traffic jams. Besides deriving a collection of useful
formulas for stability analyses, the main attention is put on the
characteristic speeds, which are related to the group velocities of the
linearized model equations. Most macroscopic traffic models with a dynamic
velocity equation appear to predict two characteristic speeds, one of which is
faster than the average velocity. This has been claimed to constitute a
theoretical inconsistency. We will carefully discuss arguments for and against
this view. In particular, we will shed some new light on the problem by
comparing Payne's macroscopic traffic model with the Aw-Rascle model and
macroscopic with microscopic traffic models.

Boussinesq systems of nonlinear partial differential equations are
fundamental equations in geophysical fluid dynamics. In this paper, we use
asymmetric ideas and moving frames to solve the two-dimensional Boussinesq
equations with partial viscosity terms studied by Chae ({\it Adv. Math.} {\bf
203} (2006), 497-513) and the three-dimensional stratified rotating Boussinesq
equations studied by Hsia, Ma and Wang ({\it J. Math. Phys.} {\bf 48} (2007),
no. 6, 06560). We obtain new families of explicit exact solutions with multiple
parameter functions. Many of them are the periodic, quasi-periodic, aperiodic
solutions that may have practical significance. By Fourier expansion and some
of our solutions, one can obtain discontinuous solutions. In addition, Lie
point symmetries are used to simplify our arguments.

We study a simple reaction-diffusion population model [proposed by A. Windus
and H. J. Jensen, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40, 2287 (2007)] on scale-free
networks. In the case of fully random diffusion, the network topology cannot
affect the critical death rate, whereas the heterogeneous connectivity can
cause smaller steady population density and critical population density. In the
case of modified diffusion, we obtain a larger critical death rate and steady
population density, at the meanwhile, lower critical population density, which
is good for the survival of species. The results were obtained using a
mean-field-like framework and were confirmed by computer simulations.

A special version of multi--dimensional simple waves given in [G. Boillat,
{\it J. Math. Phys.} {\bf 11}, 1482-3 (1970)] and [G.M. Webb, R. Ratkiewicz, M.
Brio and G.P. Zank, {\it J. Plasma Phys.} {\bf 59}, 417-460 (1998)] is employed
for fully relativistic fluid and plasma flows. Three essential modes: vortex,
entropy and sound modes are derived where each of them is different from its
nonrelativistic analogue. Vortex and entropy modes are formally solved in both
the laboratory frame and the wave frame (co-moving with the wave front) while
the sound mode is formally solved only in the wave frame at ultra-relativistic
temperatures. In addition, the surface which is the boundary between the
permitted and forbidden regions of the solution is introduced and determined.
Finally a symmetry analysis is performed for the vortex mode equation up to
both point and contact transformations. Fundamental invariants and a form of
general solutions of point transformations along with some specific examples
are also derived.

We analyze the low-energy e-N2 collisions within the framework of the
Modified-Effective Range Theory (MERT) for the long-range potentials, developed
by O'Malley, Spruch and Rosenberg [Journal of Math. Phys. 2, 491 (1961)]. In
comparison to the traditional MERT we do not expand the total cross-section in
the series of the incident momentum \hbar k, but instead we apply the exact
analytical solutions of the Schroedinger equation for the long-range
polarization potential, as proposed in the original formulation of O'Malley et
al. This extends the applicability of MERT up to few eV regime, as we confirm
using some simplified model potential of the electron-molecule interaction. The
parameters of the effective-range expansion (i.e. the scattering length and the
effective range) are determined from experimental, integral elastic cross
sections in the 0.1 - 1.0 eV energy range by fitting procedure. Surprisingly,
our treatment predicts a shape resonance that appears slightly higher than
experimentally well known resonance in the total cross section. Agreement with
the experimentally observed shape-resonance can be improved by assuming the
position of the resonance in a given partial wave. Influence of the quadrupole
potential on resonances is also discussed: we show that it can be disregarded
for N2. In conclusion, the modified-effective range formalism treating the
long-range part of the potential in an exact way, reproduces well both the very
low-energy behavior of the integral cross section as well as the presence of
resonances in the few eV range.

A self-focusing of a coasting relativistic beam in a plasma channel that is
confined by an external magnetic field is studied as a means of reconditioning
the beam emerging from a beam injector [a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ)] for
a linac. A detailed study of the beam stability in the self-focused beam has
been carried out. In order to explain beam filaments and the resistive hose
instability in a unified way, we treat all the azimuthal modes in the
derivation of the dispersion relation in a finite plasma channel that exhibit
many unstable modes, which are classified by Weinberg's scheme [Steven
Weinberg, J. Math. 8, 614 (1967)].

We present and analyze a penalization method wich extends the the method of
[1] to the case of a rigid body moving freely in an incompressible fluid. The
fluid-solid system is viewed as a single variable density flow with an
interface captured by a level set method. The solid velocity is computed by
averaging at avery time the flow velocity in the solid phase. This velocity is
used to penalize the flow velocity at the fluid-solid interface and to move the
interface. Numerical illustrations are provided to illustrate our convergence
result. A discussion of our result in the light of existing existence results
is also given. [1] Ph. Angot, C.-H. Bruneau and P. Fabrie, A penalization
method to take into account obstacles in incompressible viscous flows, Numer.

A unified energy principle approach is presented for analysing the
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability of plasmas consisting of multiple ideal and
relaxed regions. By choosing an appropriate gauge, we show that the plasma
displacement satisfies the same Euler-Lagrange equation in ideal and relaxed
regions, except in the neighbourhood of magnetic surfaces. The difference at
singular surfaces is analysed in cylindrical geometry: in ideal MHD only
Newcomb's [W. A. Newcomb (2006) Ann. Phys., 10, 232] small solutions are
allowed, whereas in relaxed MHD only the odd-parity large solution and
even-parity small solution are allowed. A procedure for constructing global
multi-region solutions in cylindrical geometry is presented. Focussing on the
limit where the two interfaces approach each other arbitrarily closely, it is
shown that the singular-limit problem encountered previously [M.J. Hole et al.
(2006) J. Plasma Phys., 77, 1167] in multi-region relaxed MHD is stabilised if
the relaxed-MHD region between the coalescing interfaces is replaced by an
ideal-MHD region. We then present a stable (k, pressure) phase space plot,
which allows us to determine the form a stable pressure and field profile must
take in the region between the interfaces. From this knowledge, we conclude
that there exists a class of single interface plasmas that were found stable by
Kaiser and Uecker [R. Kaiser et al (2004) Q. Jl Mech. Appl. Math., 57, 1], but
are shown to be unstable when the interface is resolved.

This article is the continued version of the analytical solutions for the
pressureless Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity in "M.W.
Yuen, Analyitcal Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equations, J. Math. Phys., 49
(2008) No. 11, 113102, 10pp". We are able to extend the similar solutions
structure to the case with pressure under some restriction for $\gamma$ and
$\theta$.

We point out that the {\em spacetime void} inferred by Castro[J. Math. Phys.
49, 042501, (2008)] results from his choice of a discontinuous radial gauge.
Further since the integration constant $\alpha_0 = 2M_0$ ($G=c=1$) occurring in
the vacuum Hilbert/Schwarzschild solution of a neutral "point mass" is zero
[Arnowitt et al., in Gravitation: An Introduction to Current Research, ed. L.
Witten, Wiley, Chap. 7, p.227; also Phys. Rev. Lett., 4, 375, (1960)]; A.
Mitra, Adv. Sp. Res., 38, 2917 (2006)] Castro's gauge reduces to the well
behaved and physical Hilbert gauge. Physically this means that true
Hilbert/Schwarzschild black holes have unique gravitational mass M=0.
Accordingly, the unphysical {\em spacetime viod} inferred by Castro is actually
non-existent.

This work is directed towards investigating the fate of three-dimensional
long perturbation waves in a plane incompressible wake. The analysis is posed
as an initial-value problem in space. More specifically, input is made at an
initial location in the downstream direction and then tracing the resulting
behavior further downstream subject to the restriction of finite kinetic
energy. This presentation follows the outline given by Criminale and Drazin
[Stud. in Applied Math. \textbf{83}, 123 (1990)] that describes the system in
terms of perturbation vorticity and velocity. The analysis is based on large
scale waves and expansions using multi scales and multi times for the partial
differential equations. The multiscaling is based on an approach where the
small parameter is linked to the perturbation property independently from the
flow control parameter. Solutions of the perturbative equations are determined
numerically after the introduction of a regular perturbation scheme
analytically deduced up to the second order. Numerically, the complete linear
system is also integrated. Since the results relevant to the complete problem
are in very good agreement with the results of the first order analysis, the
numerical solution at the second order was deemed not necessary. The use for an
arbitrary initial-value problem will be shown to contain a wealth of
information for the different transient behaviors associated to the symmetry,
angle of obliquity and spatial decay of the long waves. The amplification
factor of transversal perturbations never presents the trend - a growth
followed by a long damping - usually seen in waves with wavenumber of order one
or less. Asymptotical instability is always observed.

In some recent works [G. Dimarco, L. Pareschi, Hybrid multiscale methods I.
Hyperbolic Relaxation Problems, Comm. Math. Sci., 1, (2006), pp. 155-177], [G.
Dimarco, L. Pareschi, Hybrid multiscale methods II. Kinetic equations, SIAM
Multiscale Modeling and Simulation Vol 6., No 4,pp. 1169-1197, (2008)] we
developed a general framework for the construction of hybrid algorithms which
are able to face efficiently the multiscale nature of some hyperbolic and
kinetic problems. Here, at variance with respect to the previous methods, we
construct a method form-fitting to any type of finite volume or finite
difference scheme for the reduced equilibrium system. Thanks to the coupling of
Monte Carlo techniques for the solution of the kinetic equations with
macroscopic methods for the limiting fluid equations, we show how it is
possible to solve multiscale fluid dynamic phenomena faster with respect to
traditional deterministic/stochastic methods for the full kinetic equations. In
addition, due to the hybrid nature of the schemes, the numerical solution is
affected by less fluctuations when compared to standard Monte Carlo schemes.
Applications to the Boltzmann-BGK equation are presented to show the
performance of the new methods in comparison with classical approaches used in
the simulation of kinetic equations.

In this work we study the hemodynamics in a stented artery connected either
to a collateral artery or to an aneurysmal sac. The blood flow is driven by the
pressure drop. Our aim is to characterize the flow-rate and the pressure in the
contiguous zone to the main artery: using boundary layer theory we construct a
homogenized first order approximation with respect to epsilon, the size of the
stent's wires. This provides an explicit expression of the velocity profile
through and along the stent. The profile depends only on the input/output
pressure data of the problem and some homogenized constant quantities: it is
explicit. In the collateral artery this gives the flow-rate. In the case of the
aneurysm, it shows that : (i) the zeroth order term of the pressure in the sac
equals the averaged pressure along the stent in the main artery, (ii) the
presence of the stent inverses the rotation of the vortex. Extending the tools
set up in [Bonnetier et al, Adv. Math. Fluids, 2009, Milisic, Meth. Apl. Ann.,
2009] we prove rigorously that our asymptotic approximation is first order
accurate with respect to . We derive then new implicit interface conditions
that our approximation formally satisfies, generalizing our analysis to other
possible geometrical configurations. In the last part we provide numerical
results that illustrate and validate the theoretical approach.

We show that the exact integrator for the classical Kepler motion, recently
found by Kozlov ({\it J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.\} {\bf 40} (2007) 4529-4539),
can be derived in a simple natural way (using well known exact discretization
of the harmonic oscillator). We also turn attention on important earlier
references, where the exact discretization of the 4-dimensional isotropic
harmonic oscillator has been applied to the perturbed Kepler problem.

Expansion of a wave function in a basis of eigenfunctions of a differential
eigenvalue problem lies at the heart of the R-matrix methods for both the
Schr\"odinger and Dirac particles. A central issue that should be carefully
analyzed when functional series are applied is their convergence. In the
present paper, we study the properties of the eigenfunction expansions
appearing in nonrelativistic and relativistic $R$-matrix theories. In
particular, we confirm the findings of Rosenthal [J. Phys. G: Nucl. Phys. 13,
491 (1987)] and Szmytkowski and Hinze [J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 29, 761
(1996); J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 29, 6125 (1996)] that in the most popular
formulation of the R-matrix theory for Dirac particles, the functional series
fails to converge to a claimed limit.

In one of the very few exact quantum mechanical calculations of fugacity
coefficients, Dodd and Gibbs (\textit{J. Math.Phys}.,\textbf{15}, 41 (1974))
obtained $b_{2}$ and $b_{3}$ for a one dimensional Bose gas, subject to
repulsive delta-function interactions, by direct integration of the wave
functions. For $b_{2}$, we have shown (\textit{Mol. Phys}.,\textbf{103}, 1301
(2005)) that Dodd and Gibbs' result can be obtained from a phase shift
formalism, if one also includes the contribution of oscillating terms, usually
contributing only in 1 dimension. Now, we develop an exact expression for
$b_{3}-b_{3}^{0}$ (where $b_{3}^{0}$ is the free particle fugacity coefficient)
in terms of sums and differences of 3-body eigenphase shifts. Further, we show
that if we obtain these eigenphase shifts in a distorted-Born approximation,
then, to first order, we reproduce the leading low temperature behaviour,
obtained from an expansion of the two-fold integral of Dodd and Gibbs. The
contributions of the oscillating terms cancel. The formalism that we propose is
not limited to one dimension, but seeks to provide a general method to obtain
virial coefficients, fugacity coefficients, in terms of asymptotic quantities.
The exact one dimensional results allow us to confirm the validity of our
approach in this domain.

In this paper we propose an alternative approach for the assessment of
network vulnerability under random and intentional attacks as compared to the
results obtained from the "vulnerability function" given by Criado et al.
[Criado et al. (Int. J. Comput. Math., 86 (2) (2009), pp. 209-218)]. By using
spectral and statistical measurements, we assess robustness as the antonym to
vulnerability of complex networks and suggest a tentative ranking for
vulnerability, based on the interpretation of quantified network
characteristics. We conclude that vulnerability function, derived from the
network's degree distribution and its variations only, is not general enough to
reflect the lack of robustness due to the specific configurations in graphs
with hierarchical or centralized structures. The spectral and statistical
metrics, on the other hand, capture different aspects of network topology which
provide a more thorough assessment of network vulnerability.

For the first time the kinetic description of Landau diamagnetism for
degenerate collisional plasma is given. The correct expression for transverse
electric conductivity of the quantum plasma, found by authors (see
arXiv:1002.1017 [math-ph] 4 Feb 2010) is used. In work S. Dattagupta, A.M.
Jayannavar and N. Kumar [Current science, V. 80, No. 7, 10 April, 2001] was
discussed the important problem of dissipation (collisions) influence on Landau
diamagnetism. The analysis of this problem is given with the use of exact
expression for transverse conductivity of quantum plasma.

The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is well known to possess a bottleneck arising
from decreasing workload on higher levels of the FMM tree [Greengard and Gropp,
Comp. Math. Appl., 20(7), 1990]. We show that this potential bottleneck can be
eliminated by overlapping multipole and local expansion computations with
direct kernel evaluations on the finest level grid.

Dynamics of a randomly-perturbed quantum system with 3/2-degrees of freedom
is considered. We introduce a transfer operator being the quantum analogue of
the specific Poincar\'e map. This map was proposed in (Makarov, Uleysky, J.
Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2006) for exploring domains of finite-time stability,
which survive under random excitation. Our attention is concentrated on level
spacing distribution of the transfer operator, averaged over ensemble of
realizations. The problem of sound propagation in an oceanic waveguide is
considered as an example. For the acoustic frequency of 200 Hz, level spacing
distribution undergoes the crossover from Poissonian to Wigner-like statistics
with increasing time, as it is consistent with classical predictions via the
specific Poincar\'e map. For the frequency of 600 Hz, the level spacing
statistics becomes non-universal due to large number of nearly-degenerate
levels whose contribution grows with time. Occurrence of nearly-degenerate
levels is attributed to bifurcations of classical periodic orbits, caused by
fast spatial oscillations of the random perturbation.

Research of influence of collisions on Friedel oscillations in quantum
degenerate collisional plasma (T=0) is carried out for the first time. It is
shown that presence of collisions in plasma leads to exponential decreasing of
amplitude and phase shift of the Friedel oscillations. In linear approximation
the phase shift is equal to the half of quantity inverse to product of Fermi's
wave number by free length path of electrons. The correct expression for
longitudinal dielectric permeability of the quantum collisional plasma found by
the authors (see arxiv:1001.3937 [math-ph] 22 Jan 2010) is used.

An Horizontal Visibility Graph (for short, HVG) is defined in association
with an ordered set of non-negative reals. HVGs realize a methodology in the
analysis of time series, their degree distribution being a good discriminator
between randomness and chaos [B. Luque, et al., Phys. Rev. E 80 (2009),
046103]. We prove that a graph is an HVG if and only if outerplanar and has a
Hamilton path. Therefore, an HVG is a noncrossing graph, as defined in
algebraic combinatorics [P. Flajolet and M. Noy, Discrete Math., 204 (1999)
203-229]. Our characterization of HVGs implies a linear time recognition
algorithm. Treating ordered sets as words, we characterize subfamilies of HVGs
highlighting various connections with combinatorial statistics and introducing
the notion of a visible pair. With this technique we determine asymptotically
the average number of edges of HVGs.

We argue that there is a fundamental problem regarding the analysis that
serves as the foundation for the papers {\it Information theory explanation of
the fluctuation theorem, maximum entropy production and self-organized
criticality in non-equilibrium stationary states} [R. Dewar, J. Phys. A: Math.
Gen. {\bf 36} (2003), 631-641] and {\it Maximum entropy production and the
fluctuation theorem} [R. Dewar, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. {\bf 38} (2005),
L371-L381]. In particular, we demonstrate that this analysis is based on an
assumption that is physically unrealistic and that, hence, the results obtained
in those papers cannot be regarded as physically meaningful.

A paradigm based on the absolute equilibrium of Galerkin-truncated inviscid
systems to aid in understanding turbulence [T.-D. Lee, "On some statistical
properties of hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical fields," Q. Appl. Math.
10, 69 (1952)] is taken to study gyrokinetic plasma turbulence: A finite set of
Fourier modes of the collisionless gyrokinetic equations are kept and the
statistical equilibria are calculated; possible implications for plasma
turbulence in various situations are discussed. For the case of two spatial and
one velocity dimension, in the calculation with discretization also of velocity
$v$ with $N$ grid points (where $N+1$ quantities are conserved, corresponding
to an energy invariant and $N$ entropy-related invariants), the negative
temperature states, corresponding to the condensation of the generalized energy
into the lowest modes, are found. This indicates a generic feature of inverse
energy cascade. Comparisons are made with some classical results, such as those
of Charney-Hasegawa-Mima in the cold-ion limit. There is a universal shape for
statistical equilibrium of gyrokinetics in three spatial and two velocity
dimensions with just one conserved quantity. Possible physical relevance to
turbulence, such as ITG zonal flows, and to a critical balance hypothesis are
also discussed.

By applying Birkhoff's theorem to the problem of the general relativistic
collapse of a uniform density dust, we directly show that the density of the
dust $\rho=0$ even when its proper number density $n$ would be assumed to be
finite! The physical reason behind this exact result can be traced back to the
observation of Arnowitt et al. that the gravitational mass of a neutral point
particle is zero: $m=0$ (PRL, 4, 375, 1960). And since, a dust is a mere
collection of {\em neutral point particles, unlike a continuous hydrodynamic
fluid}, its density $\rho = m n=0$. It is nonetheless found that for $k=-1$, a
homogeneous dust can collapse and expand special relativistically in the
fashion of a Milne universe. Thus, in reality, general relativistic homogeneous
dust collapse does not lead to the formation of any black hole in conformity of
many previous studies (Logunov, Mestverishvili, Kiselev, Phys.Part.Nucl. 37,
317, 2006; Kisevev, Logunov & Mestvirishvili, Theor. Math. Phys., 164, 972,
2010; Mitra, J. Math. Phys. 50, 042502, 2009; Suggett, J. Phys. A, 12, 375
1979).
  Interestingly, this result is in agreement with the intuition of Oppenheimer
& Snyder (Phys. Rev. 56, p.456, 1939) too:
  "Physically such a singularity would mean that the expressions used for the
energy-momentum tensor does not take into account some essential physical fact
which would really smooth the singularity out. Further, a star in its early
stages of development would not possess a singular density or pressure, it is
impossible for a singularity to develop in a finite time."

The purpose of the present paper is to study the influence of wall-echo on
pressure fluctuations $p'$, and on statistical correlations containing $p'$,
{\em viz} redistribution $\phi_{ij}$, pressure diffusion $d_{ij}^{(p)}$, and
velocity/pressure-gradient $\Pi_{ij}$. We extend the usual analysis of
turbulent correlations containing pressure fluctuations in wall-bounded
\tsc{dns} computations [Kim J.: {\em J. Fluid Mech.} {\bf 205} (1989)
421--451], separating $p'$ not only into rapid $p_{(\mathrm{r})}'$ and slow
$p_{(\mathrm{s})}'$ parts [Chou P.Y.: {\em Quart. Appl. Math.} {\bf 3} (1945)
38--54], but further into volume ($p'_{(\mathrm{r};\mathfrak{V})}$ and
$p'_{(\mathrm{s};\mathfrak{V})}$) and surface (wall-echo; $p'_{(\mathrm{r};w)}$
and $p'_{(\mathrm{s};w)}$) terms. An algorithm, based on a Green's function
approach, is developed to compute the above splittings for various correlations
containing pressure fluctuations (redistribution, pressure diffusion,
velocity/pressure-gradient), in fully developed turbulent plane channel flow.
This exact analysis confirms previous results based on a method-of-images
approximation [Manceau R., Wang M., Laurence D.: {\em J. Fluid Mech.} {\bf 438}
(2001) 307--338] showing that, at the wall, $p'_{(\mathfrak{V})}$ and
$p'_{(w)}$ are usually of the same sign and approximately equal. The above
results are then used to study the contribution of each mechanism on the
pressure correlations in low Reynolds-number plane channel flow, and to discuss
standard second-moment-closure modelling practices.

In several applications, such as \tsc{weno} interpolation and reconstruction
[Shu C.W.: SIAM Rev. 51 (2009) 82--126], we are interested in the analytical
expression of the weight-functions which allow the representation of the
approximating function on a given stencil (Chebyshev-system) as the weighted
combination of the corresponding approximating functions on substencils
(Chebyshev-subsystems). We show that the weight-functions in such
representations [M\"uhlbach G.: Num. Math. 31 (1978) 97--110] can be generated
by a general recurrence relation based on the existence of a 1-level
subdivision rule. As an example of application we apply this recurrence to the
computation of the weight-functions for Lagrange interpolation [Carlini E.,
Ferretti R., Russo G.: SIAM J. Sci. Comp. 27 (2005) 1071--1091] for a general
subdivision of the stencil ${x_{i-M_-},...,x_{i+M_+}}$ of $M+1:=M_-+M_++1$
distinct ordered points into $K_\mathrm{s}+1\leq M:=M_-+M_+>1$ (Neville)
substencils ${x_{i-M_-+k_\mathrm{s}},...,x_{i+M_+-K_\mathrm{s}+k_\mathrm{s}}}$
($k_\mathrm{s}\in{0,...,K_\mathrm{s}}$) all containing the same number of
$M-K_\mathrm{s}+1$ points but each shifted by 1 cell with respect to its
neighbour, and give a general proof for the conditions of positivity of the
weight-functions (implying convexity of the combination), extending previous
results obtained for particular stencils and subdvisions [Liu Y.Y., Shu C.W.,
Zhang M.P.: Acta Math. Appl. Sinica 25 (2009) 503--538]. Finally, we apply the
recurrence relation to the representation by combination of substencils of
derivatives of arbitrary order of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial.

The Lagrange reconstructing polynomial [Shu C.W.: {\em SIAM Rev.} {\bf 51}
(2009) 82--126] of a function $f(x)$ on a given set of equidistant ($\Delta
x=\const$) points $\bigl\{x_i+\ell\Delta x;\;\ell\in\{-M_-,...,+M_+\}\bigr\}$
is defined [Gerolymos G.A.: {\em J. Approx. Theory} {\bf 163} (2011) 267--305]
as the polynomial whose sliding (with $x$) averages on $[x-\tfrac{1}{2}\Delta
x,x+\tfrac{1}{2}\Delta x]$ are equal to the Lagrange interpolating polynomial
of $f(x)$ on the same stencil. We first study the fundamental functions of
Lagrange reconstruction, show that these polynomials have only real and
distinct roots, which are never located at the cell-interfaces (half-points)
$x_i+n\tfrac{1}{2}\Delta x$ ($n\in\mathbb{Z}$), and obtain several identities.
Using these identities, by analogy to the recursive Neville-Aitken-like
algorithm applied to the Lagrange interpolating polynomial, we show that there
exists a unique representation of the Lagrange reconstructing polynomial on
$\{i-M_-,...,i+M_+\}$ as a combination of the Lagrange reconstructing
polynomials on the $K_\mathrm{s}+1\leq M:=M_-+M_+>1$ substencils
$\{i-M_-+k_\mathrm{s},...,i+M_+-K_\mathrm{s}+k_\mathrm{s}\}$
($k_\mathrm{s}\in\{0,...,K_\mathrm{s}\}$), with weights
$\sigma_{R_1,M_-,M_+,K_\mathrm{s},k_\mathrm{s}}(\xi)$ which are rational
functions of $\xi$ ($x=x_i+\xi\Delta x$) [Liu Y.Y., Shu C.W., Zhang M.P.: {\em
Acta Math. Appl. Sinica} {\bf 25} (2009) 503--538], and give an analytical
recursive expression of the weight-functions. We then use the analytical
expression of the weight-functions
$\sigma_{R_1,M_-,M_+,K_\mathrm{s},k_\mathrm{s}}(\xi)$ to obtain a formal proof
of convexity (positivity of the weight-functions) in the neighborhood of
$\xi=\tfrac{1}{2}$, under the condition that all of the substencils contain
either point $i$ or point $i+1$ (or both).

We present modeling of the incompressible viscous flows in the domain
containing an unconfined fluid and a porous medium. For such setting a rigorous
derivation of the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman interface condition was undertaken by
J\"ager and Mikeli\'c [SIAM J. Appl. Math. \rm 60 (2000), p. 1111-1127] using
the homogenization method. So far the interface law for the pressure was
conceived and confirmed only numerically. In this article we justify rigorously
the pressure jump condition using the corresponding boundary layer.

There were elaborated different models of Finsler geometry using the Cartan
(metric compatible), or Berwald and Chern (metric non-compatible) connections,
the Ricci flag curvature etc. In a series of works, we studied (non)commutative
metric compatible Finsler and nonholonomic generalizations of the Ricci flow
theory [see S. Vacaru, J. Math. Phys. 49 (2008) 043504; 50 (2009) 073503 and
references therein]. The goal of this work is to prove that there are some
models of Finsler gravity and geometric evolution theories with generalized
Perelman's functionals, and correspondingly derived nonholonomic Hamilton
evolution equations, when metric noncompatible Finsler connections are
involved. Following such an approach, we have to consider distortion tensors,
uniquely defined by the Finsler metric, from the Cartan and/or the canonical
metric compatible connections. We conclude that, in general, it is not possible
to elaborate self-consistent models of geometric evolution with arbitrary
Finsler metric noncompatible connections.

In the present work we analyze the problem of adaptation and evolution of RNA
virus populations, by defining the basic stochastic model as a multivariate
branching process in close relation with the branching process advanced by
Demetrius, Schuster and Sigmund ("Polynucleotide evolution and branching
processes", Bull. Math. Biol. 46 (1985) 239-262), in their study of
polynucleotide evolution. We show that in the absence of beneficial forces the
model is exactly solvable. As a result it is possible to prove several key
results directly related to known typical properties of these systems like (i)
proof, in the context of the theory of branching processes, of the lethal
mutagenesis criterion proposed by Bull, Sanju\'an and Wilke ("Theory of lethal
mutagenesis for viruses", J. Virology 18 (2007) 2930-2939); (ii) a new proposal
for the notion of relaxation time with a quantitative prescription for its
evaluation and (iii) the quantitative description of the evolution of the
expected values in four distinct regimes: transient, "stationary" equilibrium,
extinction threshold and lethal mutagenesis. Moreover, new insights on the
dynamics of evolving virus populations can be foreseen.

Following our paper [J. Math. Phys. 50 (2009) 123102], we systematically
carry out Lie symmetry analysis for the barotropic vorticity equation on the
rotating sphere. All finite-dimensional subalgebras of the corresponding
maximal Lie invariance algebra, which is infinite-dimensional, are classified.
Appropriate subalgebras are then used to exhaustively determine Lie reductions
of the equation under consideration. The relevance of the constructed exact
solutions for the description of real-world physical processes is discussed. It
is shown that the results of the above paper are directly related to the
results of the recent letter by N. H. Ibragimov and R. N. Ibragimov [Phys.
Lett. A 375 (2011) 3858] in which Lie symmetries and some exact solutions of
the nonlinear Euler equations for an atmospheric layer in spherical geometry
were determined.

We provide direct evidence of market manipulation at the beginning of the
financial crisis in November 2007. The type of manipulation, a "bear raid,"
would have been prevented by a regulation that was repealed by the Securities
and Exchange Commission in July 2007. The regulation, the uptick rule, was
designed to prevent manipulation and promote stability and was in force from
1938 as a key part of the government response to the 1929 market crash and its
aftermath. On November 1, 2007, Citigroup experienced an unusual increase in
trading volume and decrease in price. Our analysis of financial industry data
shows that this decline coincided with an anomalous increase in borrowed
shares, the selling of which would be a large fraction of the total trading
volume. The selling of borrowed shares cannot be explained by news events as
there is no corresponding increase in selling by share owners. A similar number
of shares were returned on a single day six days later. The magnitude and
coincidence of borrowing and returning of shares is evidence of a concerted
effort to drive down Citigroup's stock price and achieve a profit, i.e., a bear
raid. Interpretations and analyses of financial markets should consider the
possibility that the intentional actions of individual actors or coordinated
groups can impact market behavior. Markets are not sufficiently transparent to
reveal even major market manipulation events. Our results point to the need for
regulations that prevent intentional actions that cause markets to deviate from
equilibrium and contribute to crashes. Enforcement actions cannot reverse
severe damage to the economic system. The current "alternative" uptick rule
which is only in effect for stocks dropping by over 10% in a single day is
insufficient. Prevention may be achieved through improved availability of
market data and the original uptick rule or other transaction limitations.

In a previous paper (S. Ghosal and Z. Chen Bull. Math. Biol. 2010, vol. 72,
pg. 2047) it was shown that the evolution of the solute concentration in
capillary electrophoresis is described by a nonlinear wave equation that
reduced to Burger's equation if the nonlinearity was weak. It was assumed that
only strong electrolytes (fully dissociated) were present. In the present paper
it is shown that the same governing equation also describes the situation where
the electrolytic buffer consists of a single weak acid (or base). A simple
approximate formula is derived for the dimensionless peak variance which is
shown to agree well with published experimental data.

The differential migration of ions in an applied electric field is the basis
for separation of chemical species by capillary electrophoresis. Axial
diffusion of the concentration peak limits the separation efficiency.
Electromigration dispersion is observed when the concentration of sample ions
is comparable to that of the background ions. Under such conditions, the local
electrical conductivity is significantly altered in the sample zone making the
electric field, and therefore, the ion migration velocity concentration
dependent. The resulting nonlinear wave exhibits shock like features, and,
under certain simplifying assumptions, is described by Burgers' equation (S.
Ghosal and Z. Chen Bull. Math. Biol. 2010, vol.72, pg. 2047).In this paper, we
consider the more general situation where the walls of the separation channel
may have a non-zero zeta potential and are therefore able to sustain an
electro-osmotic bulk flow. The main result is a one dimensional nonlinear
advection diffusion equation for the area averaged concentration. This
homogenized equation accounts for the Taylor-Aris dispersion resulting from the
variation in the electro-osmotic slip velocity along the wall. It is shown that
in a certain range of parameters, the electro-osmotic flow can actually reduce
the total dispersion by delaying the formation of a concentration shock.
However, if the electro-osmotic flow is sufficiently high, the total dispersion
is increased because of the Taylor-Aris contribution.

In this paper we revisit and adapt to viral evolution an approach based on
the theory of branching process advanced by Demetrius, Schuster and Sigmund
("Polynucleotide evolution and branching processes", Bull. Math. Biol. 46
(1985) 239-262), in their study of polynucleotide evolution. By taking into
account beneficial effects we obtain a non-trivial multivariate generalization
of their single-type branching process model. Perturbative techniques allows us
to obtain analytical asymptotic expressions for the main global parameters of
the model which lead to the following rigorous results: (i) a new criterion for
"no sure extinction", (ii) a generalization and proof, for this particular
class of models, of the lethal mutagenesis criterion proposed by Bull,
Sanju\'an and Wilke ("Theory of lethal mutagenesis for viruses", J. Virology 18
(2007) 2930-2939), (iii) a new proposal for the notion of relaxation time with
a quantitative prescription for its evaluation, (iv) the quantitative
description of the evolution of the expected values in in four distinct
"stages": extinction threshold, lethal mutagenesis, stationary "equilibrium"
and transient. Finally, based on these quantitative results we are able to draw
some qualitative conclusions.

There is a very reason to consider that to solve Zeno's paradoxes is to
propose the theory of mechanical world view. We believe that this is not only
our opinion but also most philosophers' opinion. Recently, in order to justify
Heisenberg`s uncertainty principle (cf. Rep. Math. Phys Vol. 29, No. 3, 1991)
more firmly. we proposed the linguistic interpretation of quantum mechanics
(called quantum and classical measurement theory), which was characterized as
the metaphysical and linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation. This
turn from physics to language does not only extend quantum mechanicsto
classical systems but also yield the (quantum and classical) mechanical world
view (and therefore, establish the method of science). If it be so, we may
assert that Zeno's paradoxes (Flying Arrow Paradox, Achilles and the tortoise,
etc.) were already solved in measurement theory. The purpose of this paper is
to examine this assertion.

In capillary electrophoresis, sample ions migrate along a micro-capillary
filled with a background electrolyte under the influence of an applied electric
field. If the sample concentration is sufficiently high, the electrical
conductivity in the sample zone could differ significantly from the
background.Under such conditions, the local migration velocity of sample ions
becomes concentration dependent resulting in a nonlinear wave that exhibits
shock like features. If the nonlinearity is weak, the sample concentration
profile, under certain simplifying assumptions, can be shown to obey Burgers'
equation (S. Ghosal and Z. Chen Bull. Math. Biol. 2010, 72(8), pg. 2047) which
has an exact analytical solution for arbitrary initial condition.In this paper,
we use a numerical method to study the problem in the more general case where
the sample concentration is not small in comparison to the concentration of
background ions. In the case of low concentrations, the numerical results agree
with the weakly nonlinear theory presented earlier, but at high concentrations,
the wave evolves in a way that is qualitatively different.

We show how Noether conservation laws can be obtained from the particle
relabelling symmetries in the Euler-Poincar\'e theory of ideal fluids with
advected quantities. All calculations can be performed without Lagrangian
variables, by using the Eulerian vector fields that generate the symmetries,
and we identify the time-evolution equation that these vector fields satisfy.
When advected quantities (such as advected scalars or densities) are present,
there is an additional constraint that the vector fields must leave the
advected quantities invariant. We show that if this constraint is satisfied
initially then it will be satisfied for all times. We then show how to solve
these constraint equations in various examples to obtain evolution equations
from the conservation laws. We also discuss some fluid conservation laws in the
Euler-Poincar\'e theory that do not arise from Noether symmetries, and explain
the relationship between the conservation laws obtained here, and the
Kelvin-Noether theorem given in Section 4 of Holm, Marsden and Ratiu, {\it Adv.
in Math.}, 1998.

This note is a correction to a paper of Cortez, Peskin, Stockie & Varela
[SIAM J. Appl. Math., 65(2):494-520, 2004], who studied the stability of a
parametrically-forced, circular, elastic fiber immersed in an incompressible
fluid in 2D, and showed the existence of parametric resonance. The results were
represented as plots that separate parameter space into regions where the
solution is either stable or unstable. We uncovered two errors in the paper:
the first was in the derivation of the eigenvalue problem, and the second was
in the code to used to calculate the stability contours.

A model of discrete space-time is presented which is, in a sense, both
Lorentz invariant and has no restriction on the relative velocity between
particles (except v < c). The space-time has an inbuilt indeterminacy.
  Published originally as 'A quantisation of time', J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 10,
2115, 1977; identical to the original, apart from one or two minor corrections,
and some simplification towards the end of Section 6. The paper presents a
discrete model of time, in which the latter comprises a succession of instants
which are identified as collisions with particles called chronons. Proper-time
intervals are discrete; the structure of space-time is given by a radar map and
has an inbuilt indeterminacy, which leads naturally to Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. If I were writing this paper today I would identify the chronon with
the virtual Higgs boson. Without the latter all particles would be massless and
would follow null paths; there would be no such thing as proper time. Time is
an emergent phenomenon, and the Higgs boson is the agent of that emergence.

Undergraduate research is widely regarded as a high impact practice. However,
usually only the highest achieving students are rewarded with undergraduate
research opportunities. This paper reports on the successful implementation of
a student research program offering the weakest 10% of incoming freshmen
opportunities to conduct original research in one of several science or
engineering disciplines with the possibility of publication if the research and
report meet a suitable standard, defined as earning an A on the final research
project report in the introductory math course. The opportunity has been
offered now for two years to incoming cadets at the United States Air Force
Academy who are placed in Basic Math. The cadets placed in this course score in
the bottom 5% of incoming cadets on the math placement exam. During the second
semester of their freshman year, cadets enrolled in Calculus 1 are also offered
a similar research opportunity. About 10% of cadets are enrolled in this course
each Spring, the 5% who began in Basic Math and matriculate to Calculus 1 and
the 5% who failed Calculus 1 in their first attempt. During the first four
semesters, the program has yielded 22 cadet papers which have been published or
are currently under review and expected to be published. This represents
approximately 38% of the projects in the program, because the majority of the
projects do not earn As and are not suitable for publication. Over 80% of the
cadet co-authors on the publication quality papers are minorities, women,
and/or intercollegiate athletes.

We introduce an analytical kernel, the "cusp" kernel, to model the effects of
velocity-changing collisions on optically pumped atoms in low-pressure buffer
gases. Like the widely used Keilson-Storer kernel [J. Keilson and J. E. Storer,
Q. Appl. Math. 10, 243 (1952)], cusp kernels are characterized by a single
parameter and preserve a Maxwellian velocity distribution. Cusp kernels and
their superpositions are more useful than Keilson-Storer kernels, because they
are more similar to real kernels inferred from measurements or theory and are
easier to invert to find steady-state velocity distributions.

We apply our general method of duality, introduced in [Giardina', Kurchan,
Redig, J. Math. Phys. 48, 033301 (2007)], to models of population dynamics. The
classical dualities between forward and ancestral processes can be viewed as a
change of representation in the classical creation and annihilation operators,
both for diffusions dual to coalescents of Kingman's type, as well as for
models with finite population size. Next, using SU(1,1) raising and lowering
operators, we find new dualities between the Wright-Fisher diffusion with $d$
types and the Moran model, both in presence and absence of mutations. These new
dualities relates two forward evolutions. From our general scheme we also
identify self-duality of the Moran model.

The Generalized Riemann Problems (GRP) for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of
balance laws in one space dimension are now well-known and can be formulated as
follows: Given initial-data which are smooth on two sides of a discontinuity,
determine the time evolution of the solution near the discontinuity. While the
classical Riemann problem serves as a primary building block in the
construction of many numerical schemes (most notably the Godunov scheme), the
analytic study of GRP will lead to an array of GRP schemes, which extend the
Godunov scheme. Currently there are extensive studies on the second-order GRP
scheme, which proves to be robust and is capable of resolving complex
multidimensional fluid dynamic problems [M. Ben-Artzi and J. Falcovitz,
"Generalized Riemann Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics", Cambridge
University Press, 2003]. A more general formulation of the second-order GRP
solver is still confined with a class of weakly coupled systems [Numer. Math.
(2007) 106:369-425]. This paper provides a unified approach for solving the GRP
in the general context of hyperbolic balance laws, without weakly coupled
constraint, towards high order accuracy. The derivation of the second-order GRP
solver is more concise compared to those in previous works and the third-order
quadratic GRP is resolved for the first time. The latter is shown to be
necessary through numerical experiments with strong discontinuities. Our method
relies heavily on the new treatment of the rarefaction wave by deriving the
L(Q)-equations, an ODE system capturing the "evolution" of the characteristic
derivatives in x-t space for generalized Riemann invariants. The case of a
sonic point is incorporated into a general treatment. The accuracy of the
derived GRP solvers are justified and numerical examples are presented for the
performance of the resulting scheme.

The highest level of mathematics research is traditionally seen as a solitary
activity. Yet new innovations by mathematicians themselves are starting to
harness the power of social computation to create new modes of mathematical
production. We study the effectiveness of one such system, and make proposals
for enhancement, drawing on AI and computer based mathematics. We analyse the
content of a sample of questions and responses in the community question
answering system for research mathematicians, math-overflow. We find that
mathoverflow is very effective, with 90% of our sample of questions answered
completely or in part. A typical response is an informal dialogue, allowing
error and speculation, rather than rigorous mathematical argument: 37% of our
sample discussions acknowledged error. Responses typically present information
known to the respondent, and readily checked by other users: thus the
effectiveness of mathoverflow comes from information sharing. We conclude that
extending and the power and reach of mathoverflow through a combination of
people and machines raises new challenges for artificial intelligence and
computational mathematics, in particular how to handle error, analogy and
informal reasoning.

With the use of correct expression of the electric conductivity of quantum

electrical conductivity of a quantum collisional plasma in the Mermin approach,
- Theor. and Math. Phys., {\bf 175}(1): 559-569 (2013)) the kinetic description
of a magnetic susceptibility is obtained and the formula for calculation of
Landau diamagnetism is deduced.

The kinetic description of magnetic susceptibility and Landau diamagnetism of

The message passing approach of Karrer and Newman [Phys. Rev. E 82, 016101
(2010)] is an exact and practicable representation of
susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on finite trees. Here we show that,
assuming Poisson contact processes, a pair-based moment closure representation
[Sharkey, J. Math. Biol. 57, 311 (2008)] can be derived from their equations.
We extend the applicability of both representations and discuss their relative
merits. On arbitrary time-independent networks, as was shown for the message
passing formalism, the pair-based moment closure equations also provide a
rigorous lower bound on the expected number of susceptibles at all times.

We find a further class of exact solutions to the Lighthill Whitham Richards
Payne (LWRP) traffic flow equations. As before, using two consecutive
Lagrangian transformations, a linearization is achieved. Next, depending on the
initial density, we either obtain exact formulae for the dependence of the car
density and velocity on x, t, or else, failing that, the same result in a
parametric representation. The calculation always involves two possible
factorizations of a consistency condition. Both must be considered. In physical
terms, the lineup usually separates into two offshoots at different velocities.
Each velocity soon becomes uniform. This outcome in many ways resembles not
only Rowlands, Infeld and Skorupski J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 46 (2013) 365202
(part I) but also the two soliton solution to the Korteweg-de Vries equation.
This paper can be read independently of part I. This explains unavoidable
repetitions. Possible uses of both papers in checking numerical codes are
indicated at the end. Since LWRP, numerous more elaborate models, including
multiple lanes, traffic jams, tollgates etc. abound in the literature. However,
we present an exact solution. These are few and far between, other then found
by inverse scattering. The literature for various models, including ours, is
given. The methods used here and in part I may be useful in solving other
problems, such as shallow water flow.

We are interested in the energetic cost of a martensitic inclusion of volume
$V$ in austenite for the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformation. In contrast
with the work of [Kn\"upfer, Kohn, Otto: Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 66 (2013), no.
6, 867--904], we consider domain with a corner and obtain a better scaling law
for the minimal energy ($E_{min} \sim \min(V^{2/3},V^{7/9})$). Our predictions
are in a good agreement with physical experiments where nucleation of
martensite is usually observed near the corners of the specimen.

In ref [math.ST/0411462] the notion of statistically dual distributions is
introduced. The reconstruction of confidence density [AIP Conference
Proceedings 803 (2005) 398] for the location parameter for several pairs of
statistically dual distributions (Poisson and Gamma, normal and normal, Cauchy
and Cauchy, Laplace and Laplace) in the case of single observation of the
random variable is a unique. It allows to introduce the Transform between the
space of observed values and the space of possible values of the parameter.

In Ann. Math., 170 (2009), 1417-1436, C. De Lellis and L. Sz\'ekelyhidi Jr.
constructed wild solutions of the incompressible Euler equations using a
reformulation of the Euler equations as a differential inclusion together with
convex integration. In this article we adapt their construction to the system
consisting of adding the transport of a passive scalar to the two-dimensional
incompressible Euler equations.

We revisit the classic thermodynamic problem of maximum work extraction from
two arbitrary sized hot and cold reservoirs, modelled as perfect gases.
Assuming ignorance about the extent to which the process has advanced, which
implies an ignorance about the final temperatures, we quantify the prior
information about the process and assign a prior distribution to the unknown
temperature(s). This requires that we also take into account the temperature
values which are regarded to be unphysical in the standard theory, as they lead
to a contradiction with the physical laws. Instead in our formulation, such
values appear to be consistent with the given prior information and hence are
included in the inference. We derive estimates of the efficiency at optimal
work from the expected values of the final temperatures, and show that these
values match with the exact expressions in the limit when any one of the
reservoirs is very large compared to the other. For other relative sizes of the
reservoirs, we suggest a weighting procedure over the estimates from two valid
inference procedures, that generalizes the procedure suggested earlier in [J.
Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 46}, 365002 (2013)]. Thus a mean estimate for
efficiency is obtained which agrees with the optimal performance to a high
accuracy.

Following the lines of the recent papers [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 44, 495201
(2012); Eur. Phys. J. D 67, 179 (2013)], we construct here a new class of
generalized coherent states related to the Landau levels, which can be used as
the finite Fock subspaces for the representation of the $su(2)$ Lie algebra. We
establish the relationship between them and the deformed truncated coherent
states. We have, also, shown that they satisfy the resolution of the identity
property through a positive definite measures on the complex plane. Their
nonclassical and quantum statistical properties such as quadrature squeezing,
higher order `$su(2)$' squeezing, anti-bunching and anti-correlation effects
are studied in details. Particularly, the influence of the generalization on
the nonclassical properties of two modes is clarified.

Consider a finite-sized, multidimensional system in parameter state a. The
system is either at statistical equilibrium or general non-equilibrium, and may
obey either classical or quantum physics. L. Hardy's mathematical axioms
provide a basis for the physics obeyed by any such system. One axiom is that
the number N of distinguishable states a in the system obeys N=max. This
assumes that N is known as deterministic prior knowledge. However, most
observed systems suffer statistical fluctuations, for which N is therefore only
known approximately. Then what happens if the scope of the axiom N=max is
extended to include such observed systems? It is found that the state a of the
system must obey a principle of maximum Fisher information, I=I_{max}. This is
important because many physical laws have been derived, assuming as a working
hypothesis that I=I_{max}. These derivations include uses of the principle of
Extreme physical information (EPI). Examples of such derivations were of the De
Broglie wave hypothesis, quantum wave equations, Maxwell's equations, new laws
of biology (e.g. of Coulomb force-directed cell development, and of in situ
cancer growth), and new laws of economic fluctuation and investment. That the
principle I=I_{max} itself derives, from suitably extended Hardy axioms,
thereby eliminates its need to be assumed in these derivations. Thus, uses of
I=I_{max} and EPI express physics at its most fundamental level -- its
axiomatic basis in math.

The paper studies violation of conventional rules of SUSY quantum mechanics
for the centrifugal potential V(r) within the limit-circle (LC) range. A
special attention is given to transformation properties of the Titchmarsh-Weyl
m-function under Darboux deformations of the reflective Kratzer oscillator:
centrifugal Kepler-Coulomb (KC) potential plus a Taylor series in r. Since our
analysis is based on Fulton's representation of a regular-at-infinity solution
[Math. Nachr. 281, 1418 (2008)] as a superposition of two Frobenius solutions
at the origin, we refer to the appropriate expressions as the
Titchmarsh-Weyl-Fulton (TWF) functions. Explicit transformation relations are
derived for partner TWF functions associated with SUSY pairs of centrifugal
potentials. It is shown that these relations have a completely different form
for Darboux transformations (DTs) keeping the potential within the LC range.
  As an illustration, we use regular nodeless Frobenius solutions to construct
SUSY partners of the radial r- and c-Gauss-reference (GRef) potentials solvable
via hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric functions, respectively. We
explicitly demonstrate existence of non-isospectral partners of both radial
potentials in the LC region and obtain their discrete energy spectra using the
derived closed-form expressions for the TWF functions. The general
transformation relations for the TWF function have been verified taking
advantage of form-invariance of the radial GRef potentials under double-step
DTs with the so-called 'basic' seed solutions (SSs). Similarly we directly
ratify that TWF functions for three shape-invariant reflective potentials on
the half-line -- hyperbolic Poschl-Teller (h-PT), Eckart/Manning-Rosen (E/MR),
and centrifugal KC potentials - do retain their form under basic DTs.

The conservation of the recently formulated relativistic canonical helicity
[Yoshida Z, Kawazura Y, and Yokoyama T 2014 J. Math. Phys. 55 043101] is
derived from Noether's theorem by constructing an action principle on the
relativistic Lagrangian coordinates (we obtain general cross helicities that
include the helicity of the canonical vorticity). The conservation law is,
then, explained by the relabeling symmetry pertinent to the Lagrangian label of
fluid elements. Upon Eulerianizing the Noether current, the purely spatial
volume integral on the Lagrangian coordinates is mapped to a space-time mixed
three-dimensional integral on the four-dimensional Eulerian coordinates. The
relativistic conservation law in the Eulerian coordinates is no longer
represented by any divergence-free current; hence, it is not adequate to regard
the relativistic helicity (represented by the Eulerian variables) as a Noether
charge, and this stands the reason why the "conventional helicity" is no longer
a constant of motion. We have also formulated a relativistic action principle
of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on the Lagrangian coordinates, and have derived
the relativistic MHD cross helicity.

The {\it unsteady} process for thermocapillary droplet migration at large
Reynolds and Marangoni numbers has been previously reported by identifying a
nonconservative integral thermal flux across the surface in the {\it steady}
thermocapillary droplet migration, [Wu and Hu, J. Math. Phys. {\bf 54} 023102,
(2013)]. Here we add a thermal source in the droplet to preserve the integral
thermal flux across the surface as conservative, so that thermocapillary
droplet migration at large Reynolds and Marangoni numbers can reach a {\it
quasi-steady} process. Under assumptions of {\it quasi-steady} state and
non-deformation of the droplet, we make an analytical result for the {\it
steady} thermocapillary migration of droplet with the thermal source at large
Reynolds and Marangoni numbers. The result shows that the thermocapillary
droplet migration speed slowly increases with the increase of Marangoni number.

A goal of PER is to understand how students use math in physics contexts. To
investigate how students use math, we need to identify transitions between
conceptual sense-making about physical systems and using mathematics to
describe and to make predictions about those systems. We reviewed video of
students solving a variety of physics problems in small groups through the lens
of epistemic frames (e-frames). In this paper, we present a new e-frame, which
we are calling "Just Math", that is similar to the Worksheet e-frame, but is
characterized by brief, low-level, math-focused utterances between students.
Future work will focus on analyzing the transitions into and out of this
e-frame so that we may develop a more coherent understanding of students' use
of math in physics.

In recent work, Li et al.\ (Comm.\ Math.\ Sci., 7:81-107, 2009) developed a
diffuse-domain method (DDM) for solving partial differential equations in
complex, dynamic geometries with Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary
conditions. The diffuse-domain method uses an implicit representation of the
geometry where the sharp boundary is replaced by a diffuse layer with thickness
$\epsilon$ that is typically proportional to the minimum grid size. The
original equations are reformulated on a larger regular domain and the boundary
conditions are incorporated via singular source terms. The resulting equations
can be solved with standard finite difference and finite element software
packages. Here, we present a matched asymptotic analysis of general
diffuse-domain methods for Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Our analysis
shows that for certain choices of the boundary condition approximations, the
DDM is second-order accurate in $\epsilon$. However, for other choices the DDM
is only first-order accurate. This helps to explain why the choice of
boundary-condition approximation is important for rapid global convergence and
high accuracy. Our analysis also suggests correction terms that may be added to
yield more accurate diffuse-domain methods. Simple modifications of first-order
boundary condition approximations are proposed to achieve asymptotically
second-order accurate schemes. Our analytic results are confirmed numerically
in the $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms for selected test problems.

The quasi-streamfunction (Psi) formalism proposed by Kim et. al. (J.W. Kim,
K.J. Bai, R.C. Ertekin, W.C. Webster, J. Eng. Math. 40, 17 (2001)) provides a
natural framework for systematically studying zero-vorticity waves over
arbitrary bathymetry. The modified Psi-formalism developed here discards the
original constraints of zero-vorticity by allowing for vertical vorticity which
is the case of most interest for coastal dynamics. The problem is reformulated
in terms of two dynamical equations on the boundary supplemented by one
equation that represents a kinematic constraint in the interior of the domain.
In this framework, the kinematic constraint can be solved to express Psi in
terms of canonically-conjugated variables. The formalism is demonstrated for
horizontally homogeneous flows over mild topography, where asymptotic
formulations for the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions are derived based on
the Helmholz-Hodge decomposition. For potential flows, the asymptotic form of
the Hamiltonian is identical to previous results. The Lagrangian function is
also expressed as an expansion in terms of the surface height and its time
derivative and compared with Zakharov's formalism where agreement is found for
one-dimensional wave scattering.

In the framework of the focusing Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation we
study numerically the nonlinear stage of the modulation instability (MI) of the
condensate. As expected, the development of the MI leads to formation of
"integrable turbulence" [V.E. Zakharov, Turbulence in integrable systems, Stud.
in Appl. Math. 122, no. 3, 219-234, (2009)]. We study the time evolution of
it's major characteristics averaged across realizations of initial data - the
condensate solution seeded by small random noise with fixed statistical
properties. The measured quantities are: (1) wave-action spectrum and spatial
correlation function, (2) the probability density function (PDF) of wave
amplitudes and their momenta, and (3) kinetic and potential energies.

In classical kinetic or kinetic-like models a particle free path distribution
is exponensial, but this is more likely to be an exception than a rule. In this
paper we derive a linear Boltzmann-like equation for a general free path
distribution in the framework of Alt's model J. Math. Biol. 9:147 (1980). In
the special case that the free path distribution has at least first and second
finite moments we construct an asymptotic solution of the equation for small
mean free paths. The asymptotic solution becomes a diffusion approximation to
the one-speed Boltzmann-like equation.

For all the joint von Neumann measurements on a D-dimensional quantum system,
we present the specific example of a context-invariant quasi hidden variable
(qHV) model, proved in [Loubenets, J. Math. Phys. 56, 032201 (2015)] to exist
for each Hilbert space. In this model, a quantum observable X is represented by
a variety of random variables satisfying the functional condition required in
quantum foundations but, in contrast to a contextual model, each of these
random variables equivalently models X under all joint von Neumann
measurements, regardless of their contexts. This, in particular, implies the
specific local qHV (LqHV) model for an N-qudit state and allows us to derive
the new exact upper bound on the maximal violation of 2x...x2-setting Bell-type
inequalities of any type (either on correlation functions or on joint
probabilities) under N-partite joint von Neumann measurements on an N-qudit
state. For d=2, this new upper bound coincides with the maximal violation by an
N-qubit state of the Mermin-Klyshko inequality. Based on our results, we
discuss the conceptual and mathematical advantages of context-invariant and
local qHV modelling.

We consider a nonlinear kinetic equation of Boltzmann type which takes into
account the influence of conviction during the formation of opinion in a system
of agents which interact through the binary exchanges introduced in [G.
Toscani, Commun. Math. Sci. 4, 481 (2006)]. The original exchange mechanism,
which is based on the human tendency to compromise and change of opinion
through self-thinking, is here modified in the parameters of the compromise and
diffusion terms, which now are assumed to depend on the personal degree of
conviction. The numerical simulations show that the presence of conviction has
the potential to break symmetry, and to produce clusters of opinions. The model
is partially inspired by the recent work [L. Pareschi, G. Toscani, Phil. Trans.
R. Soc. A 372, 20130396 (2014)], in which the role of knowledge in the
formation of wealth distribution has been investigated.

In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem to the TROPIC CLIMATE MODEL
derived by Frierson-Majda-Pauluis in [Comm. Math. Sci, Vol. 2 (2004)] which is
a coupled system of the barotropic and the first baroclinic modes of the
velocity and the typical midtropospheric temperature. The system considered in
this paper has viscosities in the momentum equations, but no diffusivity in the
temperature equation. We establish here the global well-posedness of strong
solutions to this model. In proving the global existence of strong solutions,
to overcome the difficulty caused by the absence of the diffusivity in the
temperature equation, we introduce a new velocity $w$ (called the pseudo
baroclinic velocity), which has more regularities than the original baroclinic
mode of the velocity. An auxiliary function $\phi$, which looks like the
effective viscous flux for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, is also
introduced to obtain the $L^\infty$ bound of the temperature. Regarding the
uniqueness, we use the idea of performing suitable energy estimates at level
one order lower than the natural basic energy estimates for the system.

We consider the inverse refractor and the inverse reflector problem. The task
is to design a free-form lens or a free-form mirror that, when illuminated by a
point light source, produces a given illumination pattern on a target. Both
problems can be modeled by strongly nonlinear second-order partial differential
equations of Monge-Amp\`ere type. In [Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 25
(2015), pp. 803--837, DOI: 10.1142/S0218202515500190] the authors have proposed
a B-spline collocation method which has been applied to the inverse reflector
problem. Now this approach is extended to the inverse refractor problem. We
explain in depth the collocation method and how to handle boundary conditions
and constraints. The paper concludes with numerical results of refracting and
reflecting optical surfaces and their verification via ray tracing.

We reexamine Liouville equation based turbulence theories proposed by Qian
{[}Phys. Fluids \textbf{26}, 2098 (1983){]} and Edwards and McComb {[}J. Phys.
A: Math. Gen. \textbf{2}, 157 (1969){]}, which are compatible with Kolmogorov
spectrum. These theories obtained identical equation for spectral density
$q(k)$ and different results for damping coefficient. Qian proposed variational
approach and Edwards and McComb proposed maximal entropy principle to obtain
equation for the damping coefficient. We show that assumptions used in these
theories to obtain damping coefficient correspond to unphysical conditions.

Fourier transform methods are used to analyze functions and data sets to
provide frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of underlying oscillatory
components. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods offer speed advantages over
evaluation of explicit integrals (EI) that define Fourier transforms. This
paper compares frequency, amplitude, and phase accuracy of the two methods for
well resolved peaks over a wide array of data sets including cosine series with
and without random noise and a variety of physical data sets, including
atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentrations, tides, temperatures, sound
waveforms, and atomic spectra. The FFT uses MIT's FFTW3 library. The EI method
uses the rectangle method to compute the areas under the curve via complex
math. Results support the hypothesis that EI methods are more accurate than FFT
methods. Errors range from 5 to 10 times higher when determining peak frequency
by FFT, 1.4 to 60 times higher for peak amplitude, and 6 to 10 times higher for
phase under a peak. The ability to compute more accurate Fourier transforms has
promise for improved data analysis in many fields, including more sensitive
assessment of hypotheses in the environmental sciences related to
$\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentrations and temperature. Other methods are available to
address different weaknesses in FFTs; however, the EI method always produces
the most accurate output possible for a given data set. On the 2011 Lenovo
ThinkPad used in this study, an EI transform on a 10,000 point data set took 31
seconds to complete. Source code (C) and Windows executable for the EI method
are available at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/.

We study the long-time asymptotic of the solutions to Maxwell's equation in
the case of a upper-hybrid resonance in the cold plasma model. We base our
analysis in the transfer to the time domain of the recent results of B.
Despr\'es, L.M. Imbert-G\'erard and R. Weder, J. Math. Pures Appl. {\bf 101} (
2014) 623-659, where the singular solutions to Maxwell's equations in the
frequency domain were constructed by means of a limiting absorption principle
and a formula for the heating of the plasma in the limit of vanishing collision
frequency was obtained. Currently there is considerable interest in these
problems, in particular, because upper-hybrid resonances are a possible
scenario for the heating of plasmas, and since they can be a model for the
diagnostics involving wave scattering in plasmas.

In this paper, we consider a nonlinear interaction system between the
barotropic mode and the first baroclinic mode of the tropical atmosphere with
moisture; that was derived in [Frierson, D.M.W.; Majda, A.J.; Pauluis, O.M.:
Dynamics of precipitation fronts in the tropical atmosphere: a novel relaxation
limit, Commum. Math. Sci., 2 (2004), 591-626.] We establish the global
existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to this system, with initial data
in $H^1$, for each fixed convective adjustment relaxation time parameter
$\varepsilon>0$. Moreover, if the initial data enjoy slightly more regularity
than $H^1$, then the unique strong solution depends continuously on the initial
data. Furthermore, by establishing several appropriate
$\varepsilon$-independent estimates, we prove that the system converges to a
limiting system, as the relaxation time parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero,
with convergence rate of the order $O(\sqrt\varepsilon)$. Moreover, the
limiting system has a unique global strong solution, for any initial data in
$H^1$, and such unique strong solution depends continuously on the initial data
if the the initial data posses slightly more regularity than $H^1$. Notably,
this solves the VISCOUS VERSION of an open problem proposed in the above
mentioned paper of Frierson, Majda and Pauluis.

In our previous work [J. Math. Phys. 49, 033513 (2008)] two problems remain
to be resolved. One is that we lack a minimal group to replace GL(4,C), the
other is that the Equation of Motion (EoM) for fermion has no mass term. After
careful investigation we find these two problems are linked by conformal group,
a subgroup of GL(4,C) group. The Weyl group, a subgroup of conformal group, can
bring about the running of mass, charge etc. while making it responsible for
the transformation of interaction vertex. However, once concerning the
generation of the mass term in EoM, we have to resort to the whole conformal
group, in which the generators $K_\mu $ play a crucial role in making vacuum
vary from space-like (or light-cone-like)to time-like. Physically the starting
points are our previous conclusion, $\vec E^2-\vec B^2\neq 0$ for massive
bosons, and the two-photon process yielding $e^+ e^-$ pair. Finally we get to
the conclusion that the mass term of strong interaction is linearly relevant to
(chromo-)magnetic flux as well as angular momentum.

The helical absolute equilibrium of a compressible adiabatic flow presents
not only the polarization between the two purely helical modes of opposite
chiralities but also that between the vortical and acoustic modes, deviating
from the equipartition predicted by {\sc Kraichnan, R. H.} [1955 The Journal of
the Acoustical Society of America {\bf 27}, 438--441.]. Due to the existence of
the acoustic mode, even if all Fourier modes of one chiral sector in the
sharpened Helmholtz decomposition [{\sc Moses, H. E.} 1971 SIAM ~(Soc. Ind.
Appl. Math.) J. Appl. Math. {\bf 21}, 114--130] are thoroughly truncated,
leaving the system with positive definite helicity and energy, negative
temperature and the corresponding large-scale concentration of vortical modes
are not allowed, unlike the incompressible case.

We explain why the theory of Escauriaza, Seregin, and Sverak (Russian Math.
Surveys, 2003) on potential finite time singularity in Navier-Stokes solutions
must be largely misapprehended. It is found that the proofs of the backward
uniqueness theorem for parabolic equations contain technical errors. The stated
validity of a theorem for vorticity is established on ill-informed analyses as
the solenoidal constraint is not taken into account. There are many cases where
parabolic scalings are erroneously applied. We briefly discuss a number of
related issues.

Statistical agent-based models for crime have shown that repeat victimization
can lead to predictable crime hotspots (see e.g. Short et al., Math. Models
Methods Appl., 2008), then a recent study in one space dimension (Chaturapruek
et al., SIAM J. Appl. Math, 2013) shows that the hotspot dynamics changes when
movement patterns of the criminals involve long-tailed L\'evy distributions for
the jump length as opposed to classical random walks. In reality, criminals
move in confined areas with a maximum jump length. In this paper we develop a
mean-field continuum model with truncated L\'evy flights for residential
burglary in one space dimension. The continuum model yields local Laplace
diffusion, rather than fractional diffusion. We present an asymptotic theory to
derive the continuum equations and show excellent agreement between the
continuum model and the agent-based simulations. This suggests that local
diffusion models are universal for continuum limits of this problem, the
important quantity being the diffusion coefficient. Law enforcement agents are
also incorporated into the model, and the relative effectiveness of their
deployment strategies are compared quantitatively.

We introduce two new singularity detection criteria based on the work of
Duchon-Robert (DR) [J. Duchon and R. Robert, Nonlinearity, 13, 249 (2000)], and
Eyink [G.L. Eyink, Phys. Rev. E, 74 (2006)] which allow for the local detection
of singularities with scaling exponent $h\leqslant1/2$ in experimental flows,
using PIV measurements. We show that in order to detect such singularities, one
does not need to have access to the whole velocity field inside a volume but
can instead look for them from stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV)
data on a plane. We discuss the link with the Beale-Kato-Majda (BKM) [J.T.
Beale, T. Kato, A. Majda, Commun. Math. Phys., 94, 61 (1984)] criterion, based
on the blowup of vorticity, which applies to singularities of Navier-Stokes
equations. We illustrate our discussion using tomographic PIV data obtained
inside a high Reynolds number flow generated inside the boundary layer of a
wind tunnel. In such a case, BKM and DR criteria are well correlated with each
other.

A primary goal of physics is to create mathematical models that allow both
predictions and explanations of physical phenomena. We weave maths extensively
into our physics instruction beginning in high school, and the level and
complexity of the maths we draw on grows as our students progress through a
physics curriculum. Despite much research on the learning of both physics and
math, the problem of how to successfully teach most of our students to use
maths in physics effectively remains unsolved. A fundamental issue is that in
physics, we don't just use maths, we think about the physical world with it. As
a result, we make meaning with math-ematical symbology in a different way than
mathematicians do. In this talk we analyze how developing the competency of
mathematical modeling is more than just "learning to do math" but requires
learning to blend physical meaning into mathematical representations and use
that physical meaning in solving problems. Examples are drawn from across the
curriculum.

A global solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, obtained recently within the
wave operator formalism for explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonians [J. Phys. A:
Math. Theor. 48, 225205 (2015)], is generalized to take into account the case
of multidimensional active spaces. An iterative algorithm is derived to obtain
the Fourier series of the evolution operator issuing from a given
multidimensional active subspace and then the effective Hamiltonian
corresponding to the model space is computed and analysed as a measure of the
cyclic character of the dynamics. Studies of the laser controlled dynamics of
diatomic models clearly show that a multidimensional active space is required
if the wavefunction escapes too far from the initial subspace. A suitable
choice of the multidimensional active space, including the initial and target
states, increases the cyclic character and avoids divergences occuring when
one-dimensional active spaces are used. The method is also proven to be
efficient in describing dissipative processes such as photodissociation.

We consider the effective hydrophobicity of a periodically grooved surface
immersed in liquid, with trapped shear-free bubbles protruding between the
no-slip ridges at a $\pi/2$ contact angle. Specifically, we carry out a
singular-perturbation analysis in the limit $\epsilon\ll1$ where the bubbles
are closely spaced, finding the effective slip length (normalised by the bubble
radius) for longitudinal flow along the the ridges as
${\pi}/{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}-(12/\pi)\ln 2 + (13\pi/24)\sqrt{2\epsilon}+
o(\sqrt{\epsilon})$, the small parameter $\epsilon$ being the planform solid
fraction. The square-root divergence highlights the strong hydrophobic
character of this configuration; this leading singular term (along with the
third term) follows from a local lubrication-like analysis of the gap regions
between the bubbles, together with general matching considerations and a global
conservation relation. The $O(1)$ constant term is found by matching with a
leading-order solution in the "outer'" region, where the bubbles appear to be
touching. We find excellent agreement between our slip-length formula and a
numerical scheme recently derived using a "unified-transform" method (D.
Crowdy, IMA J. Appl. Math., 80 1902, 2015). The comparison demonstrates that
our asymptotic formula, together with the diametric "dilute-limit"
approximation (D. Crowdy, J. Fluid Mech., 791 R7, 2016), provides an elementary
analytical description for essentially arbitrary no-slip fractions.

In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem of the
three-dimensional primitive equations for oceanic and atmospheric dynamics with
only horizontal viscosity and horizontal diffusivity. We establish the local,
in time, well-posedness of strong solutions, for any initial data $(v_0,
T_0)\in H^1$, by using the local, in space, type energy estimate. We also
establish the global well-posedness of strong solutions for this system, with
any initial data $(v_0, T_0)\in H^1\cap L^\infty$, such that $\partial_zv_0\in
L^m$, for some $m\in(2,\infty)$, by using the logarithmic type anisotropic
Sobolev inequality and a logarithmic type Gronwall inequality. This paper
improves the previous results obtained in [Cao, C.; Li, J.; Titi, E.S.: Global
well-posedness of the 3D primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity and
diffusivity, Comm. Pure Appl.Math., Vol. 69 (2016), 1492-1531.], where the
initial data $(v_0, T_0)$ was assumed to have $H^2$ regularity.

We consider the 3D Cahn-Hilliard equations coupled to, and driven by, the
forced, incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The combination, known as
the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations, is used in statistical
mechanics to model the motion of a binary fluid. The potential development of
singularities (blow-up) in the contours of the order parameter $\phi$ is an
open problem. To address this we have proved a theorem that closely mimics the
Beale-Kato-Majda theorem for the $3D$ incompressible Euler equations [Beale et
al. Commun. Math. Phys., Commun. Math. Phys., ${\rm 94}$, $ 61-66 ({\rm
1984})$]. By taking an $L^{\infty}$ norm of the energy of the full binary
system, designated as $E_{\infty}$, we have shown that
$\int_{0}^{t}E_{\infty}(\tau)\,d\tau$ governs the regularity of solutions of
the full 3D system. Our direct numerical simulations (DNSs), of the 3D CHNS
equations, for (a) a gravity-driven Rayleigh Taylor instability and (b) a
constant-energy-injection forcing, with $128^3$ to $512^3$ collocation points
and over the duration of our DNSs, confirm that $E_{\infty}$ remains bounded as
far as our computations allow.

In this work, Stroh's formalism is endowed with causal properties on the
basis of an analysis of the radiation condition in the Green tensor of the
elastodynamic wave equation. The modified formalism is applied to dislocations
moving uniformly in an anisotropic medium. In practice, accounting for
causality amounts to a simple analytic continuation procedure whereby to the
dislocation velocity is added an infinitesimal positive imaginary part. This
device allows for a straightforward computation of velocity-dependent field
expressions that are valid whatever the dislocation velocity ---including
supersonic regimes--- without needing to consider subsonic and supersonic cases
separately. As an illustration, the distortion field of a Somigliana
dislocation of the Peierls-Nabarro-Eshelby-type with finite-width core is
computed analytically, starting from the Green tensor of elastodynamics. To
obtain the result in the form of a single compact expression, use of the
modified Stroh formalism requires splitting the Green function into its
reactive and radiative parts. In supersonic regimes, the solution obtained
displays Mach cones, which are supported by Dirac measures in the Volterra
limit. From these results, an explanation of Payton's `backward' Mach cones
[R.G. Payton, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 46, 282--288 (1995)] is given in terms of
slowness surfaces, and a simple criterion for their existence is derived. The
findings are illustrated by full-field calculations from analytical formulas
for a dislocation of finite width in iron, and by Huygens-type geometric
constructions of Mach cones from ray surfaces.

A pair of random walkers, the motion of each of which in two dimensions is
confined spatially by the action of a quadratic potential centered at different
locations for the two walks, are analyzed in the context of reaction-diffusion.
The application sought is to the process of transmission of infection in
epidemics. The walkers are animals such as rodents in considerations of the
Hantavirus epidemic, infected or susceptible, the reaction is the transmission
of infection, and the confining potential represents the tendency of the
animals to stay in the neighborhood of their home range centers. Calculations
are based on a recently developed formalism (Kenkre and Sugaya, Bull. Math.
Bio. 76, 3016 (2014)) structured around analytic solutions of a Smoluchowski
equation and one of its aims is the resolution of peculiar but well-known
problems of reaction-diffusion theory in 2-dimensions. In the present analysis,
reaction occurs not at points but in spatial regions of dimensions larger than
0. The analysis uncovers interesting nonintuitive phenomena one of which is
similar to that encountered in the 1-dimensional analysis given in the quoted
article, and another specific to the fact that the reaction region is spatially
extended. The analysis additionally provides a realistic description of
observations on animals transmitting infection while moving on what is
effectively a 2-dimensional landscape. Along with the general formalism and
explicit 1-dimensional analysis given in Bull. Math. Bio. 76, 3016 (2014), the
present work forms a model calculational tool for the analysis for the
transmission of infection in dilute systems.

Quantum violation of Bell inequalities is now used in many quantum
information applications and it is important to analyze it both quantitatively
and conceptually. In the present paper, we analyze violation of multipartite
Bell inequalities via the local probability model - the LqHV (local quasi
hidden variable) model [Loubenets, J. Math. Phys. 53, 022201 (2012)],
incorporating the LHV model only as a particular case and correctly reproducing
the probabilistic description of every quantum correlation scenario, more
generally, every nonsignaling scenario. The LqHV probability framework allows
us to construct nonsignaling analogs of Bell inequalities and to specify
parameters quantifying violation of Bell inequalities - Bell's nonlocality - in
a general nonsignaling case. For quantum correlation scenarios on an N-qudit
state, we evaluate these nonlocality parameters analytically in terms of
dilation characteristics of an N-qudit state and also, numerically - in d and
N. In view of our rigorous mathematical description of Bell's nonlocality in a
general nonsignaling case via the local probability model, we argue that
violation of Bell inequalities in a quantum case is not due to violation of the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) locality conjectured by Bell but due to the
improper HV modelling of "quantum realism".

Hamiltonian and action principle (HAP) formulations of plasma physics are
reviewed for the purpose of explaining structure preserving numerical
algorithms. Geometric structures associated with and emergent from HAP
formulations are discussed. These include conservative integration, which
exactly conserves invariants, symplectic integration, which exactly preserves
the Hamiltonian geometric structure, and other Hamiltonian integration
techniques. Basic ideas of variational integration and Poisson integration,
which can preserve noncanonical Hamiltonian structure, are discussed.
Metriplectic integration, which preserves the structure of conservative systems
with both Hamiltonian and dissipative parts, is proposed. Two kinds of
simulated annealing, a relaxation technique for obtaining equilibrium states,
are reviewed: one that uses metriplectic dynamics, which maximizes an entropy
at fixed energy, the other that uses double bracket dynamics, which preserves
Casimir invariants. Throughout, applications to plasma systems are emphasized.
The paper culminates with a discussion of GEMPIC [Kraus et al.,
arXiv:1609.03053v1 [math.NA] (2016)], a particle in cell code that incorporates
Hamiltonian and geometrical structure preserving properties.

Cauchy invariants are now viewed as a powerful tool for investigating the
Lagrangian structure of three-dimensional (3D) ideal flow (Frisch &
Zheligovsky, Commun. Math. Phys., vol. 326, 2014, pp. 499-505, Podvigina et
al., J. Comput. Phys., vol. 306, 2016, pp. 320-342). Looking at such invariants
with the modern tools of differential geometry and of geodesic flow on the
space SDiff of volume-preserving transformations (Arnold, Ann. Inst. Fourier,
vol. 16, 1966, pp. 319-361), all manners of generalisations are here derived.
The Cauchy invariants equation and the Cauchy formula, relating the vorticity
and the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map, are shown to be two expressions of this
Lie-advection invariance, which are duals of each other (specifically, Hodge
dual). Actually, this is shown to be an instance of a general result, which
holds for flow both in flat (Euclidean) space and in a curved Riemannian space:
any Lie-advection invariant p-form which is exact (i.e. is a differential of a
(p-1)-form) has an associated Cauchy invariants equation and a Cauchy formula.
This constitutes a new fundamental result in linear transport theory, providing
a Lagrangian formulation of Lie advection for some classes of differential
forms. The result has a broad applicability: examples include the
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations and various extensions thereof, discussed
by Lingam et al. (Phys. Lett. A, vol. 380, 2016, pp. 2400-2406), and include
also the equations of Tao (2016, arXiv:1606.08481 [math.AP]), Euler equations
with modified Biot-Savart law, displaying finite-time blow-up. Our main result
is also used for new derivations, and several new results, concerning local
helicity-type invariants for fluids and MHD flow in flat or curved spaces of
arbitrary dimension.

Topology changes in multi-phase fluid flows are difficult to model within a
traditional sharp interface theory. Diffuse interface models turn out to be an
attractive alternative to model two-phase flows. Based on a
Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model introduced by Abels, Garcke and Gr\"{u}n
(Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 2012), which uses a volume averaged velocity,
we derive a diffuse interface model in a Hele-Shaw geometry, which in the case
of non-matched densities, simplifies an earlier model of Lee, Lowengrub and
Goodman (Phys. Fluids 2002). We recover the classical Hele-Shaw model as a
sharp interface limit of the diffuse interface model. Furthermore, we show the
existence of weak solutions and present several numerical computations
including situations with rising bubbles and fingering instabilities.

We present experimental evidence of the universal emergence of the Peregrine
soliton predicted in the semi-classical (zero-dispersion) limit of the focusing
nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. {\bf 66}, 678
(2012)]. Experiments studying higher-order soliton propagation in optical fiber
use an optical sampling oscilloscope and frequency-resolved optical gating to
characterise intensity and phase around the first point of soliton compression
and the results show that the properties of the compressed pulse and background
pedestal can be interpreted in terms of the Peregrine soliton. Experimental and
numerical results reveal that the universal mechanism under study is highly
robust and can be observed over a broad range of parameters, and experiments
are in very good agreement with numerical simulations.

The strong-interaction limit of the Hohenberg-Kohn functional defines a
multimarginal optimal transport problem with Coulomb cost. From physical
arguments, the solution of this limit is expected to yield strictly-correlated
particle positions, related to each other by co-motion functions (or optimal
maps), but the existence of such a deterministic solution in the general
three-dimensional case is still an open question. A conjecture for the
co-motion functions for radially symmetric densities was presented in
Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 75}, 042511 (2007), and later used to build approximate
exchange-correlation functionals for electrons confined in low-density quantum
dots. Colombo and Stra [Math.~Models Methods Appl.~Sci., {\bf 26} 1025 (2016)]
have recently shown that these conjectured maps are not always optimal. Here we
revisit the whole issue both from the formal and numerical point of view,
finding that even if the conjectured maps are not always optimal, they still
yield an interaction energy (cost) that is numerically very close to the true
minimum. We also prove that the functional built from the conjectured maps has
the expected functional derivative also when they are not optimal.

We formulate a new family of high order on-surface radiation conditions to
approximate the outgoing solution to the Helmholtz equation in exterior
domains. Motivated by the pseudo-differential expansion of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator developed by Antoine et al. (J. Math. Anal. Appl.
229:184-211, 1999), we design a systematic procedure to apply
pseudo-differential symbols of arbitrarily high order. Numerical results are
presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method for solving both
the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary value problems. Possible improvements
and extensions are also discussed.

This paper presents a new methodology for the solution of problems of two-
and three-dimensional acoustic scattering (and, in particular, two-dimensional
electromagnetic scattering) by obstacles and defects in presence an arbitrary
number of penetrable layers. Relying on use of certain slow-rise windowing
functions, the proposed Windowed Green Function approach (WGF) efficiently
evaluates oscillatory integrals over unbounded domains, with high accuracy,
without recourse to the highly expensive Sommerfeld integrals that have
typically been used to account for the effect of underlying planar multi-layer
structures. The proposed methodology, whose theoretical basis was presented in
the recent contribution (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 76(5), p. 1871, 2016), is fast,
accurate, flexible, and easy to implement. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate that the numerical errors resulting from the proposed approach
decrease faster than any negative power of the window size. In a number of
examples considered in this paper the proposed method is up to thousands of
times faster, for a given accuracy, than corresponding methods based on use of
Sommerfeld integrals.

Upper-division physics students spend much of their time solving problems. In
addition to their basic skills and background, their epistemic framing can form
an important part of their ability to learn physics from these problems.
Encouraging students to move toward productive framing may help them solve
problems. Thus, an instructor should understand the specifics of how student
have framed a problem and understand how her interaction with the students will
impact that framing. In this study we investigate epistemic framing of students
in problem solving situations where math is applied to physics. To analyze the
frames and changes in frames, we develop and use a two-axis framework involving
conceptual and algorithmic physics and math. We examine student and instructor
framing and the interactions of these frames over a range of problems in an
upper-division electromagnetic fields course. Within interactions, students and
instructors generally follow each others' leads in framing.

Evolutionary dynamics experienced by mixed microbial populations of
cooperators and cheaters has been examined in experiments in the literature
using a protocol of periodic dilution to investigate the properties of
resilience and adaptability to environmental changes. Data depicted on an
appropriate phase diagram indicate, among other features, a stable equilibrium
point at which cooperators and cheaters coexist [A. Sanchez, J. Gore, PLOs
Biology, 11 (4), e1001547 (2013)]. We present here a phenomenological analysis
of these data focusing on an eco-evolutionary-game perspective. To that end, we
work on an extension of the model proposed by Tao and Cressman Y. Tao, R.
Cressman, Bull. Math. Biol. 69, 1377 - 1399 (2007). It's original version takes
into account changes of the total population density while the individuals
experience pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma game. The extension devised here
contains a dilution factor to be conform with the experimental procedure, in
addition of a term accounting for Allee effects. Differently from other
descriptions proposed in similar contexts, however, the model here does not
account for assortative encounters, group or kin selection. Nonetheless, it
describes surprisingly well both qualitatively and quantitatively the features
of the observed phase diagram. We discuss these results in terms of the
behavior of an effective payoff matrix defined accordingly.

A material-based, i.e., Lagrangian, methodology for exact integration of flux
by volume-preserving flows through a surface has been developed recently in
[Karrasch, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 76 (2016), pp. 1178-1190]. In the present
paper, we first generalize this framework to general compressible flows,
thereby solving the donating region problem in full generality. Second, we
demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on a slightly idealized version of a
classic two-dimensional mixing problem: transport in a cross-channel
micromixer, as considered recently in [Balasuriya, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 16
(2017), pp. 1015-1044].

The Dimensional Regularization of Bollini and Giambiags (Phys. Lett. {\bf B
40}, 566 (1972), Il Nuovo Cim. {\bf B 12}, 20 (1972). Phys. Rev. {\bf D 53},
5761 (1996)) can not be defined for all Schwartz Tempered Distributions
Explicitly Lorentz Invariant (STDELI) ${\cal S}^{'}_L$. In this paper we
overcome here such limitation and show that it can be generalized to all
aforementioned STDELI and obtain a product in a ring with zero divisors.
  For this purpose, we resort to a formula obtained in [Int. J. of Theor. Phys.
{\bf 43}, 1019 (2004)] and demonstrate the existence of the convolution (in
Minkowskian space) of such distributions. This is done by following a procedure
similar to that used so as to define a general convolution between the
Ultradistributions of J. Sebastiao e Silva [Math. Ann. {\bf 136}, 38 (1958)],
also known as Ultrahyperfunctions, obtained by Bollini et al. [Int. J. of
Theor. Phys. {\bf 38}, 2315 (1999), {\bf 43}, 1019 (2004), {\bf 43}, 59
(2004),{\bf 46}, 3030 (2007)]. Using the Inverse Fourier Transform we get the
ring with zero divisors ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA}$, defined as ${\cal
S}^{'}_{LA}={\cal F}^{-1}\{{\cal S}^{'}_L\}$, where ${\cal F}^{-1}$ denotes the
Inverse Fourier Transform. In this manner we effect a dimensional
regularization in momentum space (the ring ${\cal S}^{'}_{L}$) via convolution,
and a product of distributions in the corresponding configuration space (the
ring ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA})$. This generalizes the results obtained by Bollini and
Giambiagi for Euclidean space in [Phys. Rev. {\bf D 53}, 5761 (1996)].
  We provide several examples of the application of our new results in Quantum
Field Theory. In particular, the convolution of $n$ massless Feynman
propagators and the convolution of n massless Wheeler propagators in
Minkowskian space.

The recent study by Waclawczyk et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 175501
(2017)] possesses three shortcomings: (i) The analysis misses a key aspect of
the LMN equations which makes their Lie-group symmetry results incomplete. In
particular, two essential symmetries will break when including this aspect.
(ii) The statements on the constraints regarding the infinite-dimensional
symmetry groups are misleading. (iii) The particular symmetries originating
solely from the linearity of the LMN hierarchy violate the classical principle
of cause and effect and therefore are unphysical. Within this Comment we
present a detailed proof to this claim and conclude with the note that the new
study by Waclawczyk et al. gives an unrealistic outlook on deriving invariant
symmetry solutions for velocity correlations that arise from intermittent
processes.

We consider a delay differential equation (DDE) model for mode-locked
operation in class-A semiconductor lasers containing both gain and absorber
sections. The material processes are adiabatically eliminated as these are
considered fast in comparison to the delay time for a long cavity device. We
determine the steady states and analyze their bifurcations using DDE-BIFTOOL
[K. Engelborghs, T. Luzyanina, and D. Roose, ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 28, 1
(2002)]. Multiple forms of coexistence, transformation and hysteretic behavior
of stable steady states and fundamental periodic regimes are discussed in
bifurcation diagrams.

In this paper we study the dimension reduction limits of the compressible
Navier--Stokes equations over product Riemannian manifolds
$\mathcal{O}_\epsilon \cong \mathcal{M} \times \epsilon\mathcal{F}$, such that
$\dim\,(\mathcal{M})=n$ and $\dim\,(\mathcal{F})=d$ are arbitrary. Using the
method of relative entropies, we establish the convergence of the suitable weak
solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathcal{O}_\epsilon$ to the
classical solution of the limiting equations on $\mathcal{M}$ as $\epsilon
\rightarrow 0^+$, provided the latter exists. In addition, we also deduce the
vanishing viscosity limit. The limiting equations identified through our
analysis contain the weight function $A:\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
as a parameter, where $A(x)$ = area of fibre $\mathcal{F}_x$. Our work is based
on and generalises the results in P. Bella, E. Feireisl, M. Lewicka and A.
Novotn\'{y}, A rigorous justification of the Euler and Navier--Stokes equations
with geometric effects, \textit{SIAM J. Math. Anal.}, \textbf{48} (2016),
3907--3930, and it contains as special cases the physical models of circular
nozzles, thin plate limits and finite-length longitudinal nozzles.

Lane changing is one of the most common maneuvers on motorways. Although,
macroscopic traffic models are well known for their suitability to describe
fast moving crowded traffic, most of these models are generally developed in
one dimensional framework, henceforth lane changing behavior is somehow
neglected. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic model, which accounts for
lane-changing behavior on motorway, based on a two-dimensional extension of the
Aw and Rascle [Aw and Rascle, SIAM J.Appl.Math., 2000] and Zhang [Zhang,
Transport.Res.B-Meth., 2002] macroscopic model for traffic flow. Under
conditions, when lane changing maneuvers are no longer possible, the model
"relaxes" to the one-dimensional Aw-Rascle-Zhang model. Following the same
approach as in [Aw, Klar, Materne and Rascle, SIAM J.Appl.Math., 2002], we
derive the two-dimensional macroscopic model through scaling of time
discretization of a microscopic follow-the-leader model with driving direction.
We provide a detailed analysis of the space-time discretization of the proposed
macroscopic as well as an approximation of the solution to the associated
Riemann problem. Furthermore, we illustrate some features of the proposed model
through some numerical experiments.

A classical problem in fluid mechanics is the motion of an axisymmetric
vortex sheet evolving under the action of surface tension, surrounded by an
inviscid fluid. Lagrangian descriptions of these dynamics are well-known,
involving complex nonlocal expressions for the radial and longitudinal
velocities in terms of elliptic integrals. Here we use these prior results to
arrive at a remarkably compact and exact Eulerian evolution equation for the
sheet radius $r(z,t)$ in an explicit flux form associated with the conservation
of enclosed volume. The flux appears as an integral involving the pairwise
mutual induction formula for vortex loop pairs first derived by Helmholtz and
Maxwell. We show how the well-known linear stability results for cylindrical
vortex sheets in the presence of surface tension and streaming flows [A.M.
Sterling and C.A. Sleicher, $J.~Fluid~Mech.$ ${\bf 68}$, 477 (1975)] can be
obtained directly from this formulation. Furthermore, the inviscid limit of the
empirical model of Eggers and Dupont [$J.~Fluid~Mech.$ $\textbf{262}$ 205
(1994); $SIAM~J.~Appl.~Math.$ ${\bf 60}$, 1997 (2000)], which has served as the
basis for understanding singularity formation in droplet pinchoff, is derived
within the present formalism as the leading order term in an asymptotic
analysis for long slender axisymmetric vortex sheets, and should provide the
starting point for a rigorous analysis of singularity formation.

Combining ideas from [Alouges et al. (Numer. Math., 128, 2014)] and
[Praetorius et al. (Comput. Math. Appl., 2017)], we propose a numerical
algorithm for the integration of the nonlinear and time-dependent
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation which is unconditionally convergent,
formally (almost) second-order in time, and requires only the solution of one
linear system per time-step. Only the exchange contribution is integrated
implicitly in time, while the lower-order contributions like the
computationally expensive stray field are treated explicitly in time. Then, we
extend the scheme to the coupled system of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
with the eddy current approximation of Maxwell equations (ELLG). Unlike
existing schemes for this system, the new integrator is unconditionally
convergent, (almost) second-order in time, and requires only the solution of
two linear systems per time-step.

The presence of exotic states of matter in neutron stars (NSs) is currently
an open issue in physics. The appearance of muons, kaons, hyperons, and other
exotic particles in the inner regions of the NS, favored by energetic
considerations, is considered to be an effective mechanism to soften the
equation of state (EoS). In the so-called two-families scenario, the softening
of the EoS allows for NSs characterized by very small radii, which become
unstable and convert into a quark stars (QSs). In the process of conversion of
a NS into a QS material can be ablated by neutrinos from the surface of the
star. Not only neutron-rich nuclei, but also more exotic material, such as
hypernuclei or deconfined quarks, could be ejected into the atmosphere. In the
NS atmosphere, atoms like H, He, and C should exist, and attempts to model the
NS thermal emission taking into account their presence, with spectra modified
by the extreme magnetic fields, have been done. However, exotic atoms, like
muonic hydrogen $(p\,\mu^-)$ or the so-called Sigmium $(\Sigma^+\,e^-)$, could
also be present during the conversion process or in its immediate aftermath. At
present, analytical expressions of the wave functions and eigenvalues for these
atoms have been calculated only for H. In this work, we extend the existing
solutions and parametrizations to the exotic atoms $(p\,\mu^-)$ and
$(\Sigma^+\,e^-)$, making some predictions on possible transitions. Their
detection in the spectra of NS would provide experimental evidence for the
existence of hyperons in the interior of these stars.

Non-Abelian and non-adiabatic variants of Berry's geometric phase have been
pivotal in the recent advances in fault tolerant quantum computation gates,
while Berry's phase itself is at the heart of the study of topological phases
of matter. The geometrical and topological properties of the phase space of
spin$-1$ quantum states is richer than that of spin$-1/2$ quantum states and is
relatively unexplored. For instance, the spin vector of a spin-1 system, unlike
that of a spin$-1/2$ system, can lie anywhere on or inside the Bloch sphere
representing the phase space. Recently, a generalization of Berry's phase that
encapsulates the topology of spin-1 quantum states has been formulated in J.
Math. Phys., 59(6), 062105. This geometric phase includes loops that go inside
the Bloch sphere and is carried by the tensor of spin fluctuations, unlike
Berry's phase which is carried by the global phase of the quantum state.
Furthermore, due to a mathematical singularity at the center of the Bloch
sphere, the class of loops that pass through the center are called singular
loops and are significant because their geometric phase is non-Abelian. In
contrast with Berry's phase for spin$-1/2$ systems, whose properties come from
the topology of a sphere, the properties of singular loop geometric phases come
from the topology of the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, which is more
non-trivial. Here we use coherent control of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms in an
optical trap to experimentally explore this geometric phase for singular loops
in a spin-1 quantum system.

The derivation of the time-dependent variational equations of the
Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method for high-dimensional
quantum propagation is revisited from the perspective of tangent space
projection methods. In this context, we focus on a recently introduced
algorithm [C. Lubich, Appl. Math. Res. eXpress 2015, 311 (2015), B. Kloss et
al., J. Chem. Phys. 146, 174107 (2017)] for the integration of the MCTDH
equations, which relies on a suitable splitting of the tangent space
projection. The new integrator circumvents the direct inversion of reduced
density matrices that appears in the standard method, by employing an auxiliary
set of non-orthogonal single-particle functions. Here, we formulate the new
algorithm and the underlying alternative form of the MCTDH equations in
conventional chemical physics notation, in a complementary fashion to the
tensor formalism used in the original work. Further, key features of the
integration scheme are highlighted.

The recent claim by Grebenev et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 435502
(2017)] that the inviscid 2D Lundgren-Monin-Novikov (LMN) equations on a zero
vorticity characteristic naturally would reveal local conformal invariance when
only analyzing these by means of a classical Lie-group symmetry approach, is
invalid and will be refuted in the present comment. To note is that within this
comment the (possible) existence of conformal invariance in 2D turbulence is
not questioned, only the conclusion as is given in Grebenev et al. (2017) and
their approach how this invariance was derived is what is being criticized and
refuted herein. In fact, the algebraic derivation for conformal invariance of
the 2D LMN vorticity equations in Grebenev et al. (2017) is flawed. A key
constraint of the LMN equations has been wrongly transformed. Providing the
correct transformation instead will lead to a breaking of the proclaimed
conformal group. The corrected version of Grebenev et al. (2017) just leads to
a globally constant scaling in the fields and not to a local one as claimed. In
consequence, since in Grebenev et al. (2017) only the first equation within the
infinite and unclosed LMN chain is considered, also different Lie-group
infinitesimals for the one- and two-point probability density functions (PDFs)
will result from this correction, replacing thus the misleading ones proposed.

Three-dimensional, compressible, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence of an
isothermal, self-gravitating fluid is analyzed using two-point statistics in
the asymptotic limit of large Reynolds numbers (both kinetic and magnetic).
Following an alternative formulation proposed by S. Banerjee and S. Galtier
(Phys. Rev. E,93, 033120, 2016) and S. Banerjee and S. Galtier (J. Phys. A,
Math. and Theor.,50, 015501, 2017), an exact relation has been derived for the
total energy transfer. This approach results in a simpler relation expressed
entirely in terms of mixed second-order structure functions. The kinetic,
thermodynamic, magnetic and gravitational contributions to the energy transfer
rate can be easily separated in the present form. By construction, the new
formalism includes such additional effects as global rotation, the Hall term in
the induction equation, etc. The analysis shows that solid-body rotation cannot
alter the energy flux rate of compressible turbulence. However, the
contribution of a uniform background magnetic field to the flux is shown to be
non-trivial unlike in the incompressible case. Finally, the compressible,
turbulent energy flux rate does not vanish completely due to simple alignments,
which leads to a zero turbulent energy flux rate in the incompressible case.

It is well-known that by placing judiciously chosen image point forces and
doublets to the Stokeslet above a flat wall, the no-slip boundary condition can
be conveniently imposed on the wall [Blake, J. R. Math. Proc. Camb. Philos.
Soc. 70(2), 1971: 303.]. However, to further impose periodic boundary
conditions on directions parallel to the wall usually involves tedious
derivations because single or double periodicity in Stokes flow may require the
periodic unit to have no net force, which is not satisfied by the well-known
image system. In this work we present a force-neutral image system. This
neutrality allows us to represent the Stokes image system in a universal
formulation for non-periodic, singly periodic and doubly periodic geometries.
This formulation enables the black-box style usage of fast kernel summation
methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this new image method
with the periodic kernel independent fast multipole method in both non-periodic
and doubly periodic geometries. We then extend this new image system to other
widely used Stokes fundamental solutions, including the Laplacian of the
Stokeslet and the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor.

We consider a hierarchy of relaxation models for two-phase flow. The models
are derived from the non-equilibrium Baer-Nunziato model, which is endowed with
relaxation source terms to drive it towards equilibrium. The source terms cause
transfer of volume, heat, mass and momentum due to differences between the
phases in pressure, temperature, chemical potential and velocity, respectively.
The subcharacteristic condition is closely linked to the stability of such
relaxation systems, and in the context of two-phase flow models, it implies
that the sound speed of an equilibrium system can never exceed that of the
relaxation system. Here, previous work by Fl{\aa}tten and Lund [Math. Models
Methods Appl. Sci., 21 (12), 2011, 2379--2407] and Lund [SIAM J. Appl. Math.
72, 2012, 1713--1741] is extended to encompass two-fluid models, i.e. models
with separately governed velocities for the two phases. Each remaining model in
the hierarchy is derived, and analytical expressions for the sound speeds are
presented. Given only physically fundamental assumptions, the subcharacteristic
condition is shown to be satisfied in the entire hierarchy, either in a weak or
in a strong sense.

Despite simplicity, the synchronous cellular automaton [D.A. Young, Math.
Biosci. 72, 51 (1984)] enables reconstructing basic features of patterns of
skin. Our extended model allows studying the formatting of patterns and their
temporal evolution also on the favourable and hostile environments. As a
result, the impact of different types of an environment is accounted for the
dynamics of patterns formation. The process is based on two diffusible
morphogens, the short-range activator and the long-range inhibitor, produced by
differentiated cells (DCs) represented as black pixels. For a neutral
environment, the extended model reduces to the original one. However, even the
reduced model is statistically sensitive to a type of the initial distribution
of DCs. To compare the impact of the uniform random distribution of DCs
(R-system) and the non-uniform distribution in the form of random
Gaussian-clusters (G-system), we chose inhibitor as the control parameter. To
our surprise, in the neutral environment, for the chosen inhibitor-value that
ensures stable final patterns, the average size of final G-populations is lower
than in the R-case. In turn, when we consider the favourable environment, the
relatively bigger shift toward higher final concentrations of DCs appears in
the G. Thus, in the suitably favourable environment, this order can be
reversed. Furthermore, the different critical values of the control parameter
for the R and the G suggest some dissimilarities in temporal evolution of both
systems. In particular, within the proper ranges of the critical values, their
oscillatory behaviours are different. The respective temporal evolutions are
illustrated by a few examples.

This paper is based on the complete classification of evolutionary scenarios
for the Moran process with two strategies given by Taylor et al. (B. Math.
Biol. 66(6): 1621--1644, 2004). Their classification is based on whether each
strategy is a Nash equilibrium and whether the fixation probability for a
single individual of each strategy is larger or smaller than its value for
neutral evolution. We improve on this analysis by showing that each
evolutionary scenario is characterized by a definite graph shape for the
fixation probability function. A second class of results deals with the
behavior of the fixation probability when the population size tends to
infinity. We develop asymptotic formulae that approximate the fixation
probability in this limit and conclude that some of the evolutionary scenarios
cannot exist when the population size is large.

Using some rigorous results by Wiener [(1930). {\em Acta Math.} {\bf 30},
118-242] on the Fourier integral of a bounded function and the condition that
small-angle scattering intensities of amorphous samples are almost everywhere
continuous, we obtain the conditions that must be obeyed by a function
$\eta(\br)$ for this may be considered a physical scattering density
fluctuation. It turns out that these conditions can be recast in the form that
the $V\to\infty$ limit of the modulus of the Fourier transform of $\eta(\br)$,
evaluated over a cubic box of volume $V$ and divided by $\sqrt{V}$, exists and
that its square obeys the Porod invariant relation. Some examples of
one-dimensional scattering density functions, obeying the aforesaid condition,
are also numerically illustrated.

The full story of the Stern-Gerlach experiment and its reception,
interpretation and final understanding has many unexpected surprises. Here, we
review the history and the context of the proposal, the experiment, and the
subsequent story of the aftermath. We also discuss the story of the possible
Stern-Gerlach experiment for free electrons etc. Finally, we comment on the
remarkable career of Otto Stern.

In this short note we provide clarification to the comments made in Z. Angew.
Math. Phys. (2018) 69:64 on our work "Finiteness of corner vortices" [ Z.
Angew. Math. Phys. (2018) 69:37].

For a pulsating free surface source in a three-dimensional finite depth fluid
domain, the Green function of the source presented by John [F. John, On the
motion of floating bodies II. Simple harmonic motions, Communs. Pure Appl.
Math. 3 (1950) 45-101] is superposed as the Rankine source potential, an image
source potential and a wave integral in the infinite domain $(0, \infty)$. When
the source point together with a field point is on the free surface, John's
integral and its gradient are not convergent since the integration
$\int^\infty_\kappa$ of the corresponding integrands does not tend to zero in a
uniform manner as $\kappa$ tends to $\infty$. Thus evaluation of the Green
function is not based on direct integration of the wave integral but is
obtained by approximation expansions in earlier investigations. In the present
study, five images of the source with respect to the free surface mirror and
the water bed mirror in relation to the image method are employed to
reformulate the wave integral. Therefore the free surface Green function of the
source is decomposed into the Rankine potential, the five image source
potentials and a new wave integral, of which the integrand is approximated by a
smooth and rapidly decaying function. The gradient of the Green function is
further formulated so that the same integration stability with the wave
integral is demonstrated. The significance of the present research is that the
improved wave integration of the Green function and its gradient becomes
convergent. Therefore evaluation of the Green function is obtained through the
integration of the integrand in a straightforward manner. The application of
the scheme to a floating body or a submerged body motion in regular waves shows
that the approximation is sufficiently accurate to compute linear wave loads in
practice.

Entanglement in Quantum Field Theory is restricted to spacelike separations
to the order of the Compton wavelength $\hbar/mc$ (e.g., S. J. Summers and R.
Werner, {\it J. Math. Phys.}, {\bf 28}, 10,2440-2447, (1987)). Yet spin
entanglement of electrons across macroscopic distances has been observed by
Hensen { \it et al.} ({\it Nature}, {\bf 526}, doi:10.1038/nature/15759,
(2015)). The parametrized relativistic quantum mechanics of Feynman and
Stueckelberg admits spin singlets, across arbitrary separations, by providing a
single covariant wave equation for tensor products of two Dirac spinors (A. F.
Bennett, {\it Ann. Phys.} {\bf 345}, 1-16 (2014)). The formalism is extended
here from quantum electrodynamics to the electroweak interaction. A
relativistic Bell's inequality for Dirac spinors is extended here to weak
isospin.

A recent paper by A.~Z.~Janda [J.~Math.~Phys.~{\bf 59}, 061509 (2018)]
presented a partial solution of the equations of dissipationless Hall
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic function.
Unfortunately, an error crept up in the analysis, where the kinetic and
potential energies of the initial Hall MHD state were misidentified. The
present comment presents the correct energy analysis and offers a complete
solution of dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics in terms of the Jacobi
elliptic functions.

Motivation: Surface generation and visualization are some of the most
important tasks in biomolecular modeling and computation. Eulerian solvent
excluded surface (ESES) software provides analytical solvent excluded surface
(SES) in the Cartesian grid, which is necessary for simulating many
biomolecular electrostatic and ion channel models. However, large biomolecules
and/or fine grid resolutions give rise to excessively large memory requirements
in ESES construction. We introduce an out-of-core and parallel algorithm to
improve the ESES software.
  Results: The present approach drastically improves the spatial and temporal
efficiency of ESES. The memory footprint and time complexity are analyzed and
empirically verified through extensive tests with a large collection of
biomolecule examples. Our results show that our algorithm can successfully
reduce memory footprint through a straightforward divide-and-conquer strategy
to perform the calculation of arbitrarily large proteins on a typical commodity
personal computer. On multi-core computers or clusters, our algorithm can
reduce the execution time by parallelizing most of the calculation as disjoint
subproblems. Various comparisons with the state-of-the-art Cartesian grid based
SES calculation were done to validate the present method and show the improved
efficiency. This approach makes ESES a robust software for the construction of
analytical solvent excluded surfaces.

Liquid droplets sliding along solid surfaces are a frequently observed
phenomenon in nature, e.g., raindrops on a leaf, and in everyday situations,
e.g., drops of water in a drinking glass. To model this situation, we use a
phase field approach. The bulk model is given by the thermodynamically
consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes model from [Abels et al., Math. Mod.
Meth. Appl. Sc., 22(3), 2012]. To model the contact line dynamics we apply the
generalized Navier boundary condition for the fluid and the dynamically
advected boundary contact angle condition for the phase field as derived in
[Qian et al., J. Fluid Mech., 564, 2006]. In recent years several schemes were
proposed to solve this model numerically. While they widely differ in terms of
complexity, they all fulfill certain basic properties when it comes to
thermodynamic consistency. However, an accurate comparison of the influence of
the schemes on the moving contact line is rarely found. Therefore, we
thoughtfully compare the quality of the numerical results obtained with three
different schemes and two different bulk energy potentials. Especially, we
discuss the influence of the different schemes on the apparent contact angles
of a sliding droplet.

This paper presents a homogenisation-based constitutive model to describe the
effective tran- sient diffusion behaviour in heterogeneous media in which there
is a large contrast between the phase diffusivities. In this case mobile
species can diffuse over long distances through the fast phase in the time
scale of diffusion in the slow phase. At macroscopic scale, contrasted phase
diffusivities lead to a memory effect that cannot be properly described by
classical Fick's second law. Here we obtain effective governing equations
through a two-scale approach for composite materials consisting of a fast
matrix and slow inclusions. The micro-macro transition is similar to
first-order computational homogenisation, and involves the solution of a
transient diffusion boundary-value problem in a Representative Volume Element
of the microstructure. Different from computational homogenisation, we propose
a semi-analytical mean-field estimate of the composite response based on the
exact solution for a single inclusion developed in our previous work [Brassart,
L., Stainier, L., 2018. Effective transient behaviour of inclusions in
diffusion problems. Z. Angew Math. Mech. 98, 981-998]. A key outcome of the
model is that the macroscopic concentration is not one-to-one related to the
macroscopic chemical potential, but obeys a local kinetic equation associated
with diffusion in the slow phase. The history-dependent macroscopic response
admits a representation based on internal variables, enabling efficient time
integration. We show that the local chemical kinetics can result in non-Fickian
behaviour in macroscale boundary-value problems.

A classic problem in general relativity, long studied by both physicists and
philosophers of physics, concerns whether the geodesic principle may be derived
from other principles of the theory, or must be posited independently. In a
recent paper [Geroch & Weatherall, "The Motion of Small Bodies in Space-Time",
Comm. Math. Phys. (forthcoming)], Bob Geroch and I have introduced a new
approach to this problem, based on a notion we call "tracking". In the present
paper, I situate the main results of that paper with respect to two other,
related approaches, and then make some preliminary remarks on the
interpretational significance of the new approach. My main suggestion is that
"tracking" provides the resources for eliminating "point particles"---a
problematic notion in general relativity---from the geodesic principle
altogether.

Previously (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys., v. 52, p. 082303 (2011)), the Dirac
equation in an arbitrary electromagnetic field was shown to be generally
equivalent to a fourth-order equation for just one component of the
four-component Dirac spinor function, and the remaining component can be made
real by a gauge transformation. This work extends the result to the case of the
Dirac equation in the Yang-Mills field.

This paper discusses the generalised least-action principle introduced by
Brenier (J. Am. Math. Soc, 1989), from the perspective of turbulence modelling.
In essence, Brenier's least-action principle extends to a probabilistic setting
Arnold's geometric interpretation of ideal fluid mechanics, whereby strong
solutions to the Euler equations are deduced from minimising an action over
Lagrangian maps. While Arnold's framework relies on the deterministic concept
of Lagrangian flow, Brenier's least-action principle describes solutions to the
Euler equations in terms of non-deterministic "generalised flows", namely
probability measures over sets of Lagrangian trajectories. Generalised flows
seem naturally fit to describe turbulent Lagrangian trajectories in terms of
stochastic processes, an approach that originates from Richardson's seminal
work on turbulent dispersion. In particular, they seem suited to address cases
when the concept of Lagrangian flow breaks down, due to Lagrangian trajectories
becoming spontaneously stochastic. The purpose of the present paper is
therefore to give a physical perspective on Brenier's principle, and provide a
qualitative description of the hydrodynamical features of generalised flows.
Using Monte-Carlo techniques, we analyse the statistical features of three
classes of two-dimensional generalised flows, ranging from solid rotation and
cellular flows to to freely decaying two-dimensional turbulence. Our results
suggest that generalised variational formulations, if carefully used, may
provide new tools to coarse-grain multi-scale hydrodynamics.

The method of approximate automodel solution for the Green's function of the
time-dependent superdiffusive (nonlocal) transport equations (J. Phys. A: Math.
Theor. 49 (2016) 255002) is extended to the case of a finite velocity of
carriers. This corresponds to extension from the L\'evy flights-based transport
to the transport of the type, which belongs to the class of "L\'evy walk +
rests", to allow for the retardation effects in the L\'evy flights. This
problem covers the cases of the transport by the resonant photons in
astrophysical gases and plasmas, heat transport by electromagnetic waves in
plasmas, migration of predators, and other applications. We treat a model case
of one-dimensional transport on a uniform background with a simple power-law
step-length probability distribution function (PDF). A solution for arbitrary
superdiffusive PDF is suggested, and the verification of solution for a
particular power law PDF, which corresponds, e.g., to the Lorentzian wings of
atomic spectral line shape for emission of photons, is carried out using the
computation of the exact solution.

In this paper, we proposed a novel method using the elementary number theory
to investigate the discrete nature of the screw dislocations in crystal
lattices, simple cubic (SC) lattice and body centered cubic (BCC) lattice, by
developing the algebraic description of the dislocations in the previous report
(Hamada, Matsutani, Nakagawa, Saeki, Uesaka, Pacific J. Math.~for Industry
{\bf{10}} (2018), 3). Using the method, we showed that the stress energy of the
screw dislocations in the BCC lattice and the SC lattice are naturally
described; the energy of the BCC lattice was expressed by the truncated
Epstein-Hurwitz zeta function of the Eisenstein integers, whereas that of SC
lattice is associated with the truncated Epstein-Hurwitz zeta function of the
Gauss integers.

In a previous paper [Adv. Appl. Math. Mech. 10 (2018), pp. 1025-1056], we
used the Buchwald representation to construct several families of separable
cylindrical solutions to the Navier-Lam\'{e} equation; these solutions had the
property of being $2\pi$-periodic in the circumferential coordinate. In this
paper, we extend the analysis and obtain the complementary set of separable
solutions whose circumferential parts are elementary $2\pi$-aperiodic
functions. Collectively, we construct eighteen distinct families of separable
solutions; in each case, the circumferential part of the solution is one of
three elementary $2\pi$-aperiodic functions. These solutions are useful for
solving a wide variety of dynamical problems that involve cylindrical
geometries and for which $2\pi$-periodicity in the angular coordinate is
incompatible with the given boundary conditions. As illustrative examples, we
show how the obtained solutions can be used to solve certain forced-vibration
problems involving open cylindrical shells and open solid cylinders where (by
virtue of the boundary conditions) $2\pi$-periodicity in the angular coordinate
is inappropriate. As an addendum to our prior work, we also include an
illustrative example of a certain type of asymmetric problem that can be solved
using the particular $2\pi$-periodic subsolutions that ensue when there is no
explicit dependence on the circumferential coordinate.

We demonstrate that the asymptotic approximant applied to the Blasius
boundary layer flow over a flat plat (Barlow et al., 2017 Q. J. Mech. Appl.
Math., 70(1): 21-48) yields accurate analytic closed-form solutions to the
Falkner-Skan boundary layer equation for flow over a wedge having angle
$\beta\pi/2$ to the horizontal. A wide range of wedge angles satisfying
$\beta\in[-0.198837735, 1]$ are considered, and the previously established
non-unique solutions for $\beta<0$ having positive and negative shear rates
along the wedge are accurately represented. The approximant is used to
determine the singularities in the complex plane that prescribe the radius of
convergence of the power series solution to the Falkner-Skan equation. An
attractive feature of the approximant is that it may be constructed quickly by
recursion compared with traditional Pad\'e approximants that require a matrix
inversion. The accuracy of the approximant is verified by numerical solutions,
and benchmark numerical values are obtained that characterize the asymptotic
behavior of the Falkner-Skan solution at large distances from the wedge.

Solitons on a finite a background, also called breathers, are solutions of
the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which play a pivotal role in the
description of rogue waves and modulation instability. The breather family
includes Akhmediev breathers (AB), Kuznetsov-Ma (KM), and Peregrine solitons
(PS), which have been successfully exploited to describe several physical
effects. These families of solutions are actually only particular cases of a
more general three-parameter class of solutions originally derived by
Akhmediev, Eleonskii and Kulagin [Theor. Math. Phys. {\bf 72}, 809--818
(1987)]. Having more parameters to vary, this significantly wider family has a
potential to describe many more physical effects of practical interest than its
subsets mentioned above. The complexity of this class of solutions prevented
researchers to study them deeply. In this paper, we overcome this difficulty
and report several new effects that follow from more detailed analysis. Namely,
we present the doubly periodic solutions and their Fourier expansions. In
particular, we outline some striking properties of these solutions. Among the
new effects, we mention (a) regular and shifted recurrence, (b) period doubling
and (c) amplification of small periodic perturbations with frequencies outside
the conventional modulation instability gain band.

The action principle by Low [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 248, 282--287] for the
classic Vlasov-Maxwell system contains a mix of Eulerian and Lagrangian
variables. This renders the Noether analysis of reparametrization symmetries
inconvenient, especially since the well-known energy- and momentum-conservation
laws for the system are expressed in terms of Eulerian variables only. While an
Euler-Poincar\'e formulation of Vlasov-Maxwell-type systems, effectively
starting with Low's action and using constrained variations for the Eulerian
description of particle motion, has been known for a while [J. Math. Phys., 39,
6, pp. 3138-3157], it is hard to come by a documented derivation of the related
energy- and momentum-conservation laws in the spirit of the Euler-Poincar\'e
machinery. To our knowledge only one such derivation exists in the literature
so far, dealing with the so-called guiding-center Vlasov-Darwin system [Phys.
Plasmas 25, 102506]. The present exposition discusses a generic class of local
Vlasov-Maxwell-type systems, with a conscious choice of adopting the language
of differential geometry to exploit the Euler-Poincar\'e framework to its full
extent. After reviewing the transition from a Lagrangian picture to an Eulerian
one, we demonstrate how symmetries generated by isometries in space lead to
conservation laws for linear- and angular-momentum density and how symmetry by
time translation produces a conservation law for energy density. We also
discuss what happens if no symmetries exist. Finally, two explicit examples
will be given -- the classic Vlasov-Maxwell and the drift-kinetic
Vlasov-Maxwell -- and the results expressed in the language of regular vector
calculus for familiarity.

Motivated by renewed interest in the physics of branched polymers, we present
here a complete characterization of the connectivity and spatial properties of
$2$ and $3$-dimensional single-chain conformations of randomly branching
polymers in $\theta$-solvent conditions obtained by Monte Carlo computer
simulations. The first part of the work focuses on polymer average properties,
like the average polymer spatial size as a function of the total tree mass and
the typical length of the average path length on the polymer backbone. In the
second part, we move beyond average chain behavior and we discuss the complete
distribution functions for tree paths and tree spatial distances, which are
shown to obey the classical Redner-des Cloizeaux functional form. Our results
were rationalized first by the systematic comparison to a Flory theory for
branching polymers and, next, by generalized Fisher-Pincus relationships
between scaling exponents of distribution functions. For completeness, the
properties of $\theta$-polymers were compared to their ideal (i.e.), no volume
interactions) as well as good-solvent (i.e.), above the $\theta$-point)
counterparts. The results presented here brings to conclusion the recent work
performed in our group [A. Rosa and R. Everaers, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 49,
345001 (2016), J. Chem. Phys. 145, 164906 (2016), Phys. Rev. E 95, 012117
(2017)] in the context of the scaling properties of branching polymers.

In this work we prove that the solution of the Serre-Green-Naghdi equation
cannot be globally defined when the interface reaches the impervious bottom
tangentially. As a consequence, our result complements the paper \emph{Camassa,
R., Falqui, G., Ortenzi, G., Pedroni, M., \& Thomson, C. Hydrodynamic models
and confinement effects by horizontal boundaries. Journal of Nonlinear Science,
29(4), 1445-1498, 2019.} Furthermore, we also prove that the solution to the
$abcd-$Boussinesq system can change sign in finite time. Finally, we provide
with a proof of a scenario of finite time singularity for the $abcd-$Boussinesq
system. These latter mathematical results are related to the numerics in
\emph{Bona, \& Chen, Singular solutions of a Boussinesq system for water waves.
J. Math. Study, 49(3), 205-220, 2016}.

We present a general method for solving the modified Helmholtz equation
without shape approximation for an arbitrary periodic charge distribution,
whose solution is known as the Yukawa potential or the screened Coulomb
potential. The method is an extension of Weinert's pseudo-charge method [M.
Weinert, J. Math. Phys. 22, 2433 (1981)] for solving the Poisson equation for
the same class of charge density distributions. The inherent differences
between the Poisson and the modified Helmholtz equation are in their respective
radial solutions. These are polynomial functions, for the Poisson equation, and
modified spherical Bessel functions, for the modified Helmholtz equation. This
leads to a definition of a modified pseudo-charge density and modified
multipole moments. We have shown that Weinert's convergence analysis of an
absolutely and uniformly convergent Fourier series of the pseudo-charge density
is transferred to the modified pseudo-charge density. We conclude by
illustrating the algorithmic changes necessary to turn an available
implementation of the Poisson solver into a solver for the modified Helmholtz
equation.

This article discusses several erroneous claims which appear in textbooks on
numerical methods and computational physics. These are not typos or mistakes an
individual author has made, but widespread misconceptions. In an attempt to
stop these issues from further propagating, we discuss them here, along with
some background comments. In each case, we also provide a correction, which is
aimed at summarizing material that is known to experts but is frequently
mishandled in the introductory literature. To make the mistakes and corrections
easy to understand, we bring up specific examples drawn from elementary physics
and math. We also take this opportunity to provide pointers to the specialist
literature for readers who wish to delve into a given topic in more detail.

We extend a method (E. Canc\`es and L.R. Scott, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 50,
2018, 381--410) to compute more terms in the asymptotic expansion of the van
der Waals attraction between two hydrogen atoms. These terms are obtained by
solving a set of modified Slater-Kirkwood partial differential equations. The
accuracy of the method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and comparison
with other methods from the literature. It is also shown that the scattering
states of the hydrogen atom, that are the states associated with the continuous
spectrum of the Hamiltonian, have a major contribution to the C$_6$ coefficient
of the van der Waals expansion.

We investigate student comfort with the material in an upper-division
spins-first quantum mechanics course. Pre-lecture surveys probing students'
comfort were administered weekly, in which students assigned themselves a
"discomfort level" on a scale of 0--10 and provided a written explanation for
their choice. The weekly class-wide average discomfort level was effectively
constant over the semester, suggesting that the class found no single unit
especially jarring nor especially easy. Student written responses were coded
according to their reported source of discomfort---math, math-physics
connection, physics, and notation. The relative prevalence of these categories
varied significantly over the semester, indicating that students find that
different units present different challenges, and also that some of these
challenges fade in importance as the semester progresses. Semi-structured
interviews with students in a similar quantum mechanics course at a different
institution provided additional context and insight into these results.

The current claim by Grebenev et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 52, 335501
(2019)], namely that the inviscid and unclosed 2D Lundgren-Monin-Novikov (LMN)
equations on a zero-vorticity Lagrangian path admit conformal invariance, is
based on a flawed and misleading analysis published earlier by Grebenev et al.
(2017). All false results and conclusions made before in the Eulerian picture
were now extended by Grebenev et al. (2019) to the Lagrangian picture. Although
we have already commented on these errors and consistently refuted their
previous study (Frewer & Khujadze, 2018), we deem it necessary to address and
discuss these errors again in the new formulation and notation of Grebenev et
al. (2019) as it will offer new insights into this issue.

The Native Skywatchers programming addresses the loss of Ojibwe and Dakota
star knowledge. The goal is to help preserve indigenous astronomy and pass it
on to future generations. The star knowledge will serve as a cornerstone
inspiration for native communities and at the same time be influential to
Native students interested in science and math. Presented here is the Ojibwe
Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan-Ojibwe Sky Star Map created by Annette Lee and
collaborators as part of the Native Skywatchers Middle School Teachers Workshop
held June 2012.

The key difference between math as math and math in science is that in
science we blend our physical knowledge with our knowledge of math. This
blending changes the way we put meaning to math and even to the way we
interpret mathematical equations. Learning to think about physics with math
instead of just calculating involves a number of general scientific thinking
skills that are often taken for granted (and rarely taught) in physics classes.
In this paper, I give an overview of my analysis of these additional skills. I
propose specific tools for helping students develop these skills in subsequent
papers.

Making meaning with math in physics requires blending physical conceptual
knowledge with mathematical symbology. Students in introductory physics classes
often struggle with this, but it is an essential component of learning how to
think with math. Teaching dimensional analysis (DA). figuring out what
measurements were combined to create a symbolic quantity, is a valuable first
step in helping them learn to appreciate this difference. In this paper I
discuss some of the issues associated with learning dimensional analysis and
show some ways we can modify our instruction to help. This paper is one of a
series on how to help students develop the scientific thinking skills required
for learning to use math in science.

To further confirm the causality and stability of a second-order hyperbolic
system of partial differential equations that models the relativistic dynamics
of barotropic fluids with viscosity and heat conduction (H. Freist\"uhler and
B. Temple, J. Math. Phys. 59 (2018)), this paper studies the Fourier-Laplace
modes of this system and shows that all such modes, relative to arbitrary
Lorentz frames, (a) decay with increasing time and (b) travel at subluminal
speeds. Stability is also shown for the related model of non-barotropic fluids
(H. Freist\"uhler and B. Temple. Proc. R. Soc. A 470 (2014) and Proc. R. Soc. A
473 (2017)). Even though these properties had been known for a while in the
sense of numerical evidence, the fully analytical proofs for the subluminality
of modes of arbitrary wave numbers in arbitrary frames given here appear to be
the first regarding any five-field formulation of dissipative relativistic
fluid dynamics.

Recently, we have determined the spectrum and the wave functions of the
Hamiltonian of a Landau particle with time-dependent mass and frequency
undergoing the influence of a uniform time-dependent electric field[J. Math.
Phys. 56, 072104 (2018)]. In the present paper we extend the study of this
model that we name the time-dependent Landau problem into the context of
coherent states. By means of the traditional factorization method of the
eigenfunctions of this system expressed in terms of the generalized Laguerre
polynomials, we derive the generators of the su(1,1) Lie algebra and we
construct the coherent states a la Barut-Girardello. These states are shown to
satisfy the Klauder's mathematical requirement to build coherent states and
some of their statistical properties are calculated and analyzed. We find that
these states are sub-Poissonian in nature. We show that, addition of photons
from these coherent states, increases the statistical properties and changes
the mathematical properties of these states.

On the idea of mapped WENO-JS scheme, properties of mapping methods are
analyzed, uncertainties in mapping development are investigated, and new
rational mappings are proposed. Based on our former understandings, i.e.
mapping at endpoints {0, 1} tending to identity mapping, an integrated Cm,n
condition is summarized for function development. Uncertainties, i.e., whether
the mapping at endpoints would make mapped scheme behave like WENO or ENO,
whether piecewise implementation would entail numerical instability, and
whether WENO3-JS could preserve the third-order at first-order critical points
by mapping, are analyzed and clarified. A new piecewise rational mapping with
sufficient regulation capability is developed afterwards, where the flatness of
mapping around the linear weights and its endpoint convergence toward identity
mapping can be coordinated explicitly and simultaneously. Hence, the increase
of resolution and preservation of stability can be balanced. Especially,
concrete mappings are determined for WENO3,5,7-JS. Numerical cases are tested
for the new mapped WENO-JS, which regards numerical stability including that in
long time computation, resolution and robustness. In purpose of comparison,
some recent mappings such as IM by [App. Math. Comput. 232, 2014:453-468], RM
by [J. Sci. Comput. 67, 2016:540-580] and AIM by [J. Comput. Phys. 381,
2019:162-188] are chosen; in addition, some recent WENO-Z type scheme are
selected also. Proposed new schemes can preserve optimal orders at
corresponding critical points, achieve numerical stability and indicate overall
comparative advantages regarding accuracy, resolution and robustness.

Steady plasma flows have been studied almost exclusively in systems with
continuous symmetry or in open domains. In the absence of continuous symmetry,
the lack of a conserved quantity makes the study of flows intrinsically
challenging. In a toroidal domain, the requirement of double-periodicity for
physical quantities adds to the complications. In particular, the
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of plasma steady-state with the flow in a
non-symmetric toroidal domain allows the development of singularities when the
rotational transform of the magnetic field is rational, much like the
equilibrium MHD model. In this work, we show that steady flows can still be
maintained provided the rotational transform is close to rational and the
magnetic shear is weak. We extend the techniques developed in carrying out
perturbation methods to all orders for static MHD equilibrium by Weitzner
(Physics of Plasmas 21, 022515 (2014)) to MHD equilibrium with flows. We
construct perturbative MHD equilibrium in a doubly-periodic domain with nearly
parallel flows by systematically eliminating magnetic resonances order by
order. We then utilize an additional symmetry of the flow problem, first
discussed by E. Hameiri in (J. Math. Phys. \textbf{22}, 2080 (1981) Sec. III),
to obtain a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation for a class of non-symmetric
three-dimensional MHD equilibrium with flows both parallel and perpendicular to
the magnetic field. For this class of flows, we are able to obtain
non-symmetric generalizations of integrals of motion, such as Bernoulli's
function and angular momentum. Finally, we obtain the generalized Hamada
conditions, which are consistency conditions necessary to suppress singular
currents in such a system when the magnetic field lines are closed. We do not
attempt to address the question of neoclassical damping of flows.

In our earlier publication we introduced the Spectrally Integrated Voigt
Function (SIVF) as an alternative to the traditional Voigt function for the
HITRAN-based applications [Quine & Abrarov, JQSRT 2013]. It was shown that
application of the SIVF enables us to reduce spectral resolution without loss
of accuracy in computation of the spectral radiance. As a further development,
in this study we present more efficient SIVF approximations derived by using a
new sampling method based on incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function
[Abrarov & Quine, Appl. Math. Comput. 2015]. Since the SIVF mathematically
represents the mean value integral of the Voigt function, this method accounts
for area under the curve of the Voigt function. Consequently, the total band
radiance, defined as the integrated spectral radiance within a given spectral
region, can also retain its accuracy even at low spectral resolution. Our
numerical results demonstrate that application of the SIVF may be promising for
more rapid line-by-line computation in atmospheric models utilizing the HITRAN
molecular spectroscopic database. Such an approach may be particularly
efficient to implement a retrieval algorithm for the greenhouse gases from the
NIR space data collected by Earth-orbiting micro-spectrometers like Argus 1000
for their operation in a real-time mode. The real-time mode operation of the
micro-spectrometers can be advantageous for instant decision making during
flight for more efficient data collection from space.

We consider the thin-film equation $\partial_t h + \partial_y \left(m(h)
\partial_y^3 h\right) = 0$ in $\{h > 0\}$ with partial-wetting boundary
conditions and inhomogeneous mobility of the form $m(h) =
h^3+\lambda^{3-n}h^n$, where $h \ge 0$ is the film height, $\lambda > 0$ is the
slip length, $y > 0$ denotes the lateral variable, and $n \in (0,3)$ is the
mobility exponent parameterizing the nonlinear slip condition. The
partial-wetting regime implies the boundary condition $\partial_y h =
\mathrm{const.} > 0$ at the triple junction $\partial\{h > 0\}$ (nonzero
microscopic contact angle). Existence and uniqueness of traveling-wave
solutions to this problem under the constraint $\partial_y^2 h \to 0$ as $h \to
\infty$ have been proved in previous work by Chiricotto and Giacomelli in
[Commun. Appl. Ind. Math., 2(2):e-388, 16, 2011]. We are interested in the
asymptotics as $h \downarrow 0$ and $h \to \infty$. By reformulating the
problem as $h \downarrow 0$ as a dynamical system for the difference between
the solution and the microscopic contact angle, values for $n$ are found for
which linear as well as nonlinear resonances occur. These resonances lead to a
different asymptotic behavior of the solution as $h\downarrow0$ depending on
$n$.
  Together with the asymptotics as $h\to\infty$ characterizing the Cox-Voinov
law for the velocity-dependent macroscopic contact angle as found by
Giacomelli, the first author of this work, and Otto in [Nonlinearity,
29(9):2497-2536, 2016], the rigorous asymptotics of traveling-wave solutions to
the thin-film equation in partial wetting can be characterized. Furthermore,
our approach enables us to analyze the relation between the microscopic and
macroscopic contact angle. It is found that the Cox-Voinov law for the
macroscopic contact angle depends continuously differentiably on the
microscopic contact angle.

For ideal fluid flow with zero surface tension and gravity, it remains
unknown whether local singularities on the free surface can develop in
well-posed initial value problems with smooth initial data. This is so despite
great advances over the last 25 years in the mathematical analysis of the Euler
equations for water waves. Here we expand our earlier work (Chin. Ann. Math.
Ser. B 40 (2019) 925) and review the mathematical literature and some of the
history concerning Dirichlet's ellipsoids and related hyperboloids associated
with jet formation and "flip-through," "splash singularities," and recent
constructions of singular free surfaces that however violate the Taylor sign
condition for linear well-posedness. We illustrate some of these phenomena with
numerical computations of 2D flow based upon a conformal mapping formulation
(whose derivation is detailed and discussed in an appendix). Additional
numerical evidence strongly suggests that corner singularities may form in an
unstable self-similar way from specially prepared initial data.

Math anxiety is a clinical pathology impairing cognitive processing in
math-related contexts. Originally thought to affect only inexperienced,
low-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly
diffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed
studies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples
well-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and
subconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a
pathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of
students in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly
with academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students'
well-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These
patterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating
math anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network
science provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening
upon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data
science, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as
complex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g.
graph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional
associations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not
only can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math
anxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of
interacting factors, e.g. key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a
given cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways
for unveiling students' perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can
enable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety.

In a previous paper [Jayanti, P.C., Trivisa, K. Local Existence of Solutions
to a Navier-Stokes-Nonlinear-Schr\"odinger Model of Superfluidity. J. Math.
Fluid Mech. 24, 46 (2022)], the authors proved the existence of local-in-time
weak solutions to a model of superfluidity. The system of governing equations
was derived by Pitaevskii in 1959 and couples the nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation (NLS) and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). In this article, we prove
a weak-strong type uniqueness theorem for these weak solutions. Only some of
their regularity properties are used, allowing room for improved existence
theorems in the future, with compatible uniqueness results.

Entropy-Stable (ES) schemes, specifically those built from [Tadmor
\textit{Math. Comput.} 49 (1987) 91], have been gaining interest over the past
decade, especially in the context of under-resolved simulations of compressible
turbulent flows using high-order methods. These schemes are attractive because
they can provide stability in a global and nonlinear sense (consistency with
thermodynamics). However, fully realizing the potential of ES schemes requires
a better grasp of their local behavior. Entropy-stability itself does not imply
good local behavior [Gouasmi \textit{et al.} \textit{J. Sci. Comp.} 78 (2019)
971, Gouasmi \textit{et al.} \textit{Comput. Methd. Appl. M.} 363 (2020)
112912]. In this spirit, we studied ES schemes in problems where \textit{global
stability is not the core issue}. In the present work, we consider the accuracy
degradation issues typically encountered by upwind-type schemes in the
low-Mach-number regime [Turkel \textit{Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech.} 31 (1999) 285]
and their treatment using \textit{Flux-Preconditioning} [Turkel \textit{J.
Comput. Phys.} 72 (1987) 277, Miczek \textit{et al.} \textit{A \& A} 576 (2015)
A50]. ES schemes suffer from the same issues and Flux-Preconditioning can
improve their behavior without interfering with entropy-stability. This is
first demonstrated analytically: using similarity and congruence transforms we
were able to establish conditions for a preconditioned flux to be ES, and
introduce the ES variants of the Miczek's and Turkel's preconditioned fluxes.
This is then demonstrated numerically through first-order simulations of two
simple test problems representative of the incompressible and acoustic limits,
the Gresho Vortex and a right-moving acoustic wave. The results are overall
consistent with previous studies [...]

Froth flotation is a common unit operation used in mineral processing. It
serves to separate valuable mineral particles from worthless gangue particles
in finely ground ores. The valuable mineral particles are hydrophobic and
attach to bubbles of air injected into the pulp. This creates bubble-particle
aggregates that rise to the top of the flotation column where they accumulate
to a froth or foam layer that is removed through a launder for further
processing. At the same time, the hydrophilic gangue particles settle and are
removed continuously. The drainage of liquid due to capillarity is essential
for the formation of a stable froth layer. This effect is included into a
previously formulated hyperbolic system of partial differential equations that
models the volume fractions of floating aggregates and settling hydrophilic
solids [R. B\"{u}rger, S. Diehl and M.C. Mart\'i, {\it IMA J. Appl. Math.} {\bf
84} (2019) 930--973]. The construction of desired steady-state solutions with a
froth layer is detailed and feasibility conditions on the feed volume fractions
and the volumetric flows of feed, underflow and wash water are visualized in
so-called operating charts. A monotone numerical scheme is derived and employed
to simulate the dynamic behaviour of a flotation column. It is also proven
that, under a suitable Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, the approximate
volume fractions are bounded between zero and one when the initial data are.

Z.E. Musielak has reported in 2008 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 41} 055205
methods to obtain standard and non-standard Lagrangians and identify classes of
equations of motion that admit a Lagrangian description. In this comment we
show how to obtain new non-standard Lagrangians using the non-standard
Lagrangians previously found. In particular, it is demonstrated that for every
non-standard Lagrangian one can generate a new non-standard Lagrangian
associated to a new equation of motion.

In this paper we investigate the homeostatic mechanism in two biologically
motivated models: intracellular copper regulation and self immune recognition.
The analysis is based on the notions of infinitesimal homeostasis and
near-perfect homeostasis. We introduce a theoretical background that makes it
possible to consider points of infinitesimal homeostasis that lie at the
boundary of the domain of definition of the input-output function. We show that
the two models display near-perfect homeostasis. Moreover, we show that, unlike
the examples of [M. Reed, J. Best, M. Golubitsky, I. Stewart, and H. F.
Nijhout. Analysis of homeostatic mechanisms in biochemical networks. Bull.
Math. Biol., 79(11):2534-2557, 2017], the obstruction of occurrence of
infinitesimal homeostasis in both of them is caused by the modeling assumptions
that force the point of infinitesimal homeostasis to lie at the boundary of
domain of definition of the respective input-output functions.

We consider the problem of "wall-to-wall optimal transport" in which we
attempt to maximize the transport of a passive temperature field between hot
and cold plates. Specifically, we optimize the choice of the divergence-free
velocity field in the advection-diffusion equation subject to an enstrophy
constraint (which can be understood as a constraint on the power required to
generate the flow). Previous work established an a priori upper bound on the
transport, scaling as the 1/3-power of the flow's enstrophy. Recently, Tobasco
& Doering (Phys. Rev. Lett. vol.118, 2017, p.264502}) and Doering & Tobasco
(Comm. Pure Appl. Math. vol.72, 2019, p.2385--2448}) constructed self-similar
two-dimensional steady branching flows saturating this bound up to a
logarithmic correction. This logarithmic correction appears to arise due to a
topological obstruction inherent to two-dimensional steady branching flows. We
present a construction of three-dimensional "branching pipe flows" that
eliminates the possibility of this logarithmic correction and therefore
identifies the optimal scaling as a clean 1/3-power law. Our flows resemble
previous numerical studies of the three-dimensional wall-to-wall problem by
Motoki, Kawahara & Shimizu (J. Fluid Mech. vol.851, 2018, p.R4}). We also
discuss the implications of our result to the heat transfer problem in
Rayleigh--B\'enard convection and the problem of anomalous dissipation in a
passive scalar.

We present $TimeEvolver$, a program for computing time evolution in a generic
quantum system. It relies on well-known Krylov subspace techniques to tackle
the problem of multiplying the exponential of a large sparse matrix $i H$,
where $H$ is the Hamiltonian, with an initial vector $v$. The fact that $H$ is
Hermitian makes it possible to provide an easily computable bound on the
accuracy of the Krylov approximation. Apart from effects of numerical roundoff,
the resulting a posteriori error bound is rigorous, which represents a crucial
novelty as compared to existing software packages such as $Expokit$ (R. Sidje,
ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 24 (1) 1998). On a standard notebook, $TimeEvolver$
allows to compute time evolution with adjustable precision in Hilbert spaces of
dimension greater than $10^6$. Additionally, we provide routines for deriving
the matrix $H$ from a more abstract representation of the Hamiltonian operator.

This work considers two linear operators which yield wave modes that are
classified as neutrally stable, yet have responses that grow or decay in time.
Previously, King et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 1, 2016, 073604:1-19) and Huber et
al. (IMA J. Appl. Math., 85, 2020, 309-340) examined the one-dimensional (1D)
wave propagation governed by these operators. Here, we extend the linear
operators to two spatial dimensions (2D) and examine the resulting solutions.
We find that the increase of dimension leads to long-time behaviour where the
magnitude is reduced by a factor of $t^{\frac{-1}{2}}$ from the 1D solutions.
Thus, regions of the solution which grew algebraically as $t^{\frac{1}{2}}$ in
1D now are algebraically neutral in 2D, whereas regions which decay
(algebraically or exponentially) in 1D now decay more quickly in 2D.
Additionally, we find that these two linear operators admit long-time solutions
that are functions of the same similarity variable that contracts space and
time.

When surface-active molecules are released at a liquid interface, their
spreading dynamics is controlled by Marangoni flows. Though such Marangoni
spreading was investigated in different limits, exact solutions remain very
few. Here we consider the spreading of an insoluble surfactant along the
interface of a deep fluid layer. For two-dimensional Stokes flows, it was
recently shown that the non-linear transport problem can be exactly mapped to a
complex Burgers equation [Crowdy, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 81, 2526 (2021)]. We
first present a very simple derivation of this equation. We then provide fully
explicit solutions and find that varying the initial surfactant distribution -
pulse, hole, or periodic - results in distinct spreading behaviors. By
obtaining the fundamental solution, we also discuss the influence of surface
diffusion. We identify situations where spreading can be described as an
effective diffusion process but observe that this approximation is not
generally valid. Finally, the case of a three-dimensional flow with axial
symmetry is briefly considered. Our findings should provide reference solutions
for Marangoni spreading, that may be tested experimentally with fluorescent or
photoswitchable surfactants.

The chemical diffusion master equation (CDME) describes the probabilistic
dynamics of reaction--diffusion systems at the molecular level [del Razo et
al., Lett. Math. Phys. 112:49, 2022]; it can be considered the master equation
for reaction--diffusion processes. The CDME consists of an infinite ordered
family of Fokker--Planck equations, where each level of the ordered family
corresponds to a certain number of particles and each particle represents a
molecule. The equations at each level describe the spatial diffusion of the
corresponding set of particles, and they are coupled to each other via reaction
operators --linear operators representing chemical reactions. These operators
change the number of particles in the system, and thus transport probability
between different levels in the family. In this work, we present three
approaches to formulate the CDME and show the relations between them. We
further deduce the non-trivial combinatorial factors contained in the reaction
operators, and we elucidate the relation to the original formulation of the
CDME, which is based on creation and annihilation operators acting on
many-particle probability density functions. Finally we discuss applications to
multiscale simulations of biochemical systems among other future prospects.

We generalize the notion of quantum state designs to infinite-dimensional
spaces. We first prove that, under the definition of continuous-variable (CV)
state $t$-designs from Comm. Math. Phys. 326, 755 (2014), no state designs
exist for $t\geq2$. Similarly, we prove that no CV unitary $t$-designs exist
for $t\geq 2$. We propose an alternative definition for CV state designs, which
we call rigged $t$-designs, and provide explicit constructions for $t=2$. As an
application of rigged designs, we develop a design-based shadow-tomography
protocol for CV states. Using energy-constrained versions of rigged designs, we
define an average fidelity for CV quantum channels and relate this fidelity to
the CV entanglement fidelity. As an additional result of independent interest,
we establish a connection between torus $2$-designs and complete sets of
mutually unbiased bases.

In this paper, we develop a fully conservative, positivity-preserving, and
entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin scheme for simulating the chemically
reacting, compressible Euler equations with complex thermodynamics. The
proposed formulation is an extension of the conservative, high-order numerical
method previously developed by Johnson and Kercher [J. Comput. Phys., 423
(2020), 109826] that maintains pressure equilibrium between adjacent elements.
In this first part of our two-part paper, we focus on the one-dimensional case.
Our methodology is rooted in the minimum entropy principle satisfied by entropy
solutions to the multicomponent, compressible Euler equations, which was proved
by Gouasmi et al. [ESAIM: Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 54 (2020), 373--389] for
nonreacting flows. We first show that the minimum entropy principle holds in
the reacting case as well. Next, we introduce the ingredients required for the
solution to have nonnegative species concentrations, positive density, positive
pressure, and bounded entropy. We also discuss how to retain the aforementioned
ability to preserve pressure equilibrium between elements. Operator splitting
is employed to handle stiff chemical reactions. To guarantee satisfaction of
the minimum entropy principle in the reaction step, we develop an
entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin method based on diagonal-norm
summation-by-parts operators for solving ordinary differential equations. The
developed formulation is used to compute canonical one-dimensional test cases,
namely thermal-bubble advection, multicomponent shock-tube flow, and a moving
hydrogen-oxygen detonation wave with detailed chemistry. We find that the
enforcement of an entropy bound can considerably reduce the large-scale
nonlinear instabilities that emerge when only the positivity property is
enforced, to an even greater extent than in the monocomponent, calorically
perfect case.

We experimentally investigate the behaviour of instantaneous localised
releases of heavy particles falling as turbulent clouds in quiescent water,
both with and without background rotation. We present the results of 514
systematic experiments for no rotation and for three rotation rates $\Omega =
5,10,20$rpm, and for the size of particles in the range $5\mu m$ to $1mm$,
exploring four decades of the Rouse number $\mathcal{R} \in [6\times
10^{-4},4]$ which quantifies the inertia of particles. In the canonical
framework of turbulent thermals described by Morton \textit{et al.}, [Proc. R.
Soc. A: Math. Phys. Sci. \textbf{234}, 1 (1956)], we compare particle clouds
with salt-water thermals to highlight specificities due to the particulate
nature of the turbulence forcing. In the absence of rotation, particle clouds
initially behave as salty thermals with a modulation of their entrainment
capacity, which is optimally enhanced for a finite inertia $\mathcal{R}\simeq
0.3$ due to particulate effects. However this regime of turbulence is limited
in time due to the inertial decoupling between turbulent eddies and particles.
For the three values of $\Omega$ explored here, the particulate enhancement of
entrainment is inhibited. Moreover the cloud's expansion is interrupted when
the Coriolis force overcomes its inertia, forcing the cloud to transform into
vortical columnar flows which considerably increase the residence time of
particles.

We study the tail of $p(U)$, the probability distribution of
$U=\vert\psi(0,L)\vert^2$, for $\ln U\gg 1$, $\psi(x,z)$ being the solution to
$\partial_z\psi -\frac{i}{2m}\nabla_{\perp}^2 \psi =g\vert S\vert^2\, \psi$,
where $S(x,z)$ is a complex Gaussian random field, $z$ and $x$ respectively are
the axial and transverse coordinates, with $0\le z\le L$, and both $m\ne 0$ and
$g>0$ are real parameters. We perform the first instanton analysis of the
corresponding Martin-Siggia-Rose action, from which it is found that the
realizations of $S$ concentrate onto long filamentary instantons, as $\ln U\to
+\infty$. The tail of $p(U)$ is deduced from the statistics of the instantons.
The value of $g$ above which $\langle U\rangle$ diverges coincides with the one
obtained by the completely different approach developed in Mounaix et al. 2006
{\it Commun. Math. Phys.} {\bf 264}~741. Numerical simulations clearly show a
statistical bias of $S$ towards the instanton for the largest sampled values of
$\ln U$. The high maxima -- or `hot spots' -- of $\vert S(x,z)\vert^2$ for the
biased realizations of $S$ tend to cluster in the instanton region.

The Sakiadis boundary layer induced by a moving wall in a semi-infinite fluid
domain is a fundamental laminar flow field relevant to high speed coating
processes. This work provides an analytical solution to the boundary layer
problem for Ostwald-de Waele power law fluids via a power series expansion, and
extends the approach taken for Newtonian fluids [Naghshineh et al., "On the use
of asymptotically motivated gauge functions to obtain convergent series
solutions to nonlinear ODEs", IMA J. of Appl. Math., (2023)] in which variable
substitutions (which naturally determine the gauge function in the power
series) are chosen to be consistent with the large distance behavior away from
the wall. Contrary to prior literature, the asymptotic behavior dictates that a
solution only exists in the range of power law exponents, $\alpha$, lying in
the range $0.5 < \alpha \leq 1$. An analytical solution is obtained in the
range of approximately $0.74 \leq \alpha < 1$, using a convergent power series
with an asymptotically motivated gauge function. For power laws corresponding
to $0.5 < \alpha<0.74$, the gauge function becomes ill-defined over the full
domain, and an approximate analytical solution is obtained using the method of
asymptotic approximants [Barlow et al., "On the summation of divergent,
truncated, and underspecified power series via asymptotic approximants", Q. J.
Mech. Appl. Math., (2017)]. The approximant requires knowledge of two physical
constants, which we compute a priori using a numerical shooting method on a
finite domain. The utility of the power series solution is that it can be
solved on the entire semi-infinite domain and--in contrast to a numerical
solution--does not require a finite domain length approximation and subsequent
domain length refinement.

Learning to use math in physics involves combining (blending) our everyday
experiences and the conceptual ideas of physics with symbolic mathematical
representations. Graphs are one of the best ways to learn to build the blend.
They are a mathematical representation that builds on visual recognition to
create a bridge between words and equations. But students in introductory
physics classes often see a graph as an endpoint, a task the teacher asks them
to complete, rather than as a tool to help them make sense of a physical
system. And most of the graph problems in traditional introductory physics
texts simply ask students to extract a number from a graph. But if graphs are
used appropriately, they can be a powerful tool in helping students learn to
build the blend and develop their physical intuition and ability to think with
math.

M.V. Berry's work [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43, 415302 (2010)] highlighted
the correspondence between backflow in quantum mechanics and superoscillations
in waves. Superoscillations refer to situations where the local oscillation of
a superposition is faster than its fastest Fourier component. This concept has
been used to demonstrate backflow in transverse linear momentum for optical
waves. In this work, we examine the interference of classical light carrying
only negative orbital angular momentum and observe in the dark fringes of such
an interference, positive local orbital angular momentum. This finding may have
implications for the studies of light-matter interaction and represents a step
towards observing quantum backflow in two dimensions.

The ability to express scientific concepts in mathematical terms and
integrate scientific and mathematical reasoning about a phenomenon is a
foundational cognitive process involved in scientific thinking. This process
called blended math-science sensemaking (blended MSS) is a desired skill for
all STEM students, but few students are learning it, and there is little
research on how to teach it. In this work we introduce the development and
testing of a novel instructional method for teaching blended (MSS) that is
suitable for use in STEM courses in undergraduate and K-12 educational
settings. This study builds on our past work on developing and validating a
framework for characterizing in detail the cognitive levels involved in such
sensemaking. This work uses the unique power of interactive simulations for
assessing and developing blended MSS. We designed instructional activities to
help students use blended MSS in the contexts of heat capacity and Coulombs
law. The Heat Capacity activity was piloted in a freshmen Chemistry course and
the Coulombs law activity was piloted in a freshmen Physics course. The results
indicate that for students who came in with no knowledge of the relevant
equation the activity supported the development of both the equation, and their
understanding of the mathematical relationships of the equation. These results
indicate that the teaching approach helps students engage in blended MSS at
higher levels of cognitive complexity.

As students pursue a bachelor's degree in physics, they may ponder over which
area to specialize in, such as theory, computation, or experiment. Often
students develop preferences and dislikes, but it's unclear when this
preference solidifies during their undergraduate experiences. To get a better
understanding, we interviewed eighteen physics majors who were at different
stages of their degree regarding their interest in theory, computation, and
experimental methods. Out of the eighteen students, we chose to analyze only
nine students who rated computation and theory the lowest. Our analysis did not
include interest in experiment because the ratings were less negative. We used
Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and Lucidchart to analyze students'
responses and create individual graphical representations of the influences for
each student. Through this, we uncovered how various factors such as learning
experiences, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations influenced their low
interest in a particular method. We found that lack of knowledge and experience
is often the main reason why self-efficacy was lower. Students' lack of
interest is also influenced by negative outcome expectations (e.g,
math-intensive and a bad work-life balance) more than other SCCT factors. Our
findings could help physics departments and educators identify positive and
negative factors that could lead to a more motivating and inclusive physics
curriculum.

We further develop the concept of supergrowth [Jordan, Quantum Stud.: Math.
Found. $\textbf{7}$, 285-292 (2020)], a phenomenon complementary to
superoscillation, defined as the local amplitude growth rate of a function
being higher than its largest wavenumber. We identify the superoscillating and
supergrowing regions of a canonical oscillatory function and find the maximum
values of local growth rate and wavenumber. Next, we provide a quantitative
comparison of lengths and relevant intensities between the superoscillating and
the supergrowing regions of a canonical oscillatory function. Our analysis
shows that the supergrowing regions contain intensities that are exponentially
larger in terms of the highest local wavenumber compared to the
superoscillating regions. Finally, we prescribe methods to reconstruct a
sub-wavelength object from the imaging data using both superoscillatory and
supergrowing point spread functions. Our investigation provides an
experimentally preferable alternative to the superoscillation based
superresolution schemes and is relevant to cutting-edge research in far-field
sub-wavelength imaging.

The proposition that photon is a topological object (J. Math. Phys. 49,
032303, 2008) is given rigorous foundation based on pure vector field theory
independent of the electromagnetic fields. Holomorphy of 4-dimensional
space-time and the nature of topological obstructions are investigated to
articulate singular vortex model for photon. The utility of the Euclidean
symmetry group is discussed in detail for the proposed photon model.

Many interesting physical problems described by systems of hyperbolic
conservation laws are stiff, and thus impose a very small time-step because of
the restrictive CFL stability condition. In this case, one can exploit the
superior stability properties of implicit time integration which allows to
choose the time-step only from accuracy requirements, and thus avoid the use of
small time-steps. We discuss an efficient framework to devise high order
implicit schemes for stiff hyperbolic systems without tailoring it to a
specific problem. The nonlinearity of high order schemes, due to space- and
time-limiting procedures which control nonphysical oscillations, makes the
implicit time integration difficult, e.g.~because the discrete system is
nonlinear also on linear problems. This nonlinearity of the scheme is
circumvented as proposed in (Puppo et al., Comm.~Appl.~Math.~\& Comput., 2023)
for scalar conservation laws, where a first order implicit predictor is
computed to freeze the nonlinear coefficients of the essentially
non-oscillatory space reconstruction, and also to assist limiting in time. In
addition, we propose a novel conservative flux-centered a-posteriori
time-limiting procedure using numerical entropy indicators to detect troubled
cells. The numerical tests involve classical and artificially devised stiff
problems using the Euler's system of gas-dynamics.

The prototypical diffuse-interface model that describes multi-component flows
is the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard model (NSCH). Over the last decades many
NSCH models have appeared that claim to describe the same physical phenomena,
yet are distinct from one another. In a recent article [M.F.P. ten Eikelder,
K.G. van der Zee, I. Akkerman, and D. Schillinger, Math. Mod. Meth. Appl. S.
33, pp 175-221, 2023.] we have established a unified framework of virtually all
NSCH models. The framework reveals that there is only a single consistent NSCH
model that naturally emanates from the underlying mixture theory. In the
current article we present, verify and validate this novel consistent NSCH
model by means of numerical simulation. To this purpose we discretize a
divergence-free velocity formulation of the NSCH model using
divergence-conforming isogeometric spaces. We compare computations of our
consistent model to results of existing models from literature. The predictive
capability of the numerical methodology is demonstrated via three-dimensional
computations of a rising bubble and the contraction of a liquid filament that
compare well with experimental data.

This work concerns the analysis of electromagnetic dispersive media modelled
by generalized Lorentz models. More precisely, this paper is the second of two
articles dedicated to the long time behaviour of solutions of Maxwell's
equations in dissipative Lorentz media, via the long time decay rate of the
electromagnetic energy for the corresponding Cauchy problem. In opposition to
the frequency dependent Lyapunov functions approach used in [Cassier, Joly,
Rosas Mart\'inez, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 74 (2023), 115], we develop a method
based on the spectral analysis of the underlying non-self-adjoint operator of
the model. Although more involved, this approach is closer to physics, as it
uses the dispersion relation of the model, and has the advantage to provide
more precise and more optimal results, leading to distinguish the notion of
weak and strong dissipation.

In periodic systems, the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange energy exhibits the
slowest convergence of all HF energy components as the system size approaches
the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate that the recently proposed staggered
mesh method for Fock exchange energy [Xing, Li, and Lin, Math. Comp., 2024],
which is specifically designed to sidestep certain singularities in exchange
energy evaluation, can expedite the finite-size convergence rate for the exact
exchange energy across a range of insulators and semiconductors when compared
to the regular and truncated Coulomb methods. This remains true even for two
computationally cheaper versions of this new method, which we call Non-SCF and
Split-SCF staggered mesh. Additionally, a sequence of numerical tests on simple
solids showcases the staggered mesh method's ability to improve convergence
towards the thermodynamic limit for band gaps, bulk moduli, equilibrium lattice
dimensions, energies, and phonon force constants.

A model for the motion of slender vortex filaments is extended to include the
effect of gravity. The model, initially introduced by Callegari and Ting (SIAM,
J. of App. Math., (1978), vol. 35, pp. 148-175), is based on a matched
asymptotic expansion in which the outer solution, given by the Biot-Savart law,
is matched with the inner solution derived from the Navier-Stokes equations.
Building on recent work by Harikrishnan et al (Phys. of Fluids, (2023), vol.
35) the Boussinesq approximation is applied such that the density variations
only enter in the gravity term. However, unlike Harikrishnan et al. (2023) the
density variation enters at a lower order in the asymptotic expansion, and thus
has a more significant impact on the self-induced velocity of the vortex
filament. In this regime, which corresponds to the regime studied by Chang and
Smith (J. of Fl. Mech., (2018), vol. 857), the effect of gravity is given by an
alteration of the core constant, which couples the motion of the filament to
the motion within the vortical core, in addition to a change in the
compatability conditions (evolution equations) which determine the leading
order azimuthal and tangential velocity fields in the vortex core. The results
are used to explain certain properties of bouyant vortex rings, as well as
qualitatively explore the impact of gravity on tornado type atmospheric
vorticies.

It is essential to efficiently solve multiscale flows covering the continuum
regime to the rarefied regime. The explicit form of Grad's 13 moments
distribution function-based moment gas kinetic solver (G13-MGKS) has been
proposed in our previous work [Comput. Math. Appl., 137 (2023), pp. 112-125],
which demonstrates the potential for efficiently simulating continuum flows
accurately and presenting reasonable predictions for rarefied flows at moderate
Knudsen numbers on structured meshes. To further extend the solver's
applicability to unstructured meshes, we propose the simplified version of the
Grad's 13 moments distribution function-based moment gas kinetic solver
(SG13-MGKS) with an explicit form of the numerical flux in the present paper.
The Shakhov collision model has been adopted and validated within the framework
of SG13-MGKS to ensure the correct Prandtl number in the simulation.
Additionally, a simplified treatment for the numerical fluxes has been adopted
to minimize the need for complex calculations of the gradient of integral
coefficients. The performance of SG13-MGKS has been evaluated in numerical
cases of Couette flow with temperature differences, flow passing through a
NACA0012 airfoil, and pressure-driven flow in a variable-diameter circular
pipe. Our results demonstrate that SG13-MGKS can achieve reasonably accurate
computational results at Knudsen numbers below 0.2. Benefiting from the
avoidance of discretization in velocity space, G13-MGKS is able to be two
orders of magnitude faster compared to the conventional discrete velocity
method. Furthermore, the simplified form of numerical fluxes and the fewer
gradients of integration coefficients enable the performance of SG13-MGKS on
unstructured grids with a saving of about 4 times the computation time and 3
times the memory cost compared to the previous version of G13-MGKS.

In this note, we address some issues concerning the accurate pressure
calculation of Coulomb systems with periodic boundary conditions. First, we
prove that the formulas for the excess part of the pressure with Ewald
summation also reduce to the ensemble average of one-third of the ratio between
the potential energy and the volume so that the comments on our previous work
in a recent paper by [Onegin~\emph{et al}.,~J. Phys. A: Math.~Theor.~57 (2024)
205002] are incorrect. Second, we demonstrate that in charge non-neutral
systems, the pressure expression must be corrected to include interactions with
the neutralizing background. This addresses the issues about pressure
computation in LAMMPS raised in the paper by Onegin {\it et al.}. Numerical
experiments are performed to verify that the pressure obtained via Ewald
summation with corrected terms agrees with the average pressure using
thermodynamics for the non-neutral OCP system, and are independent of the
splitting parameter in the Ewald summation.

This work investigates heat transport in rotating internally heated
convection, for a horizontally periodic fluid between parallel plates under
no-slip and isothermal boundary conditions. The main results are the proof of
bounds on the mean temperature, $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$, and the heat
flux out of the bottom boundary, $\mathcal{F}_B$ at infinite Prandtl numbers
where the Prandtl number is the nondimensional ratio of viscous to thermal
diffusion. The lower bounds are functions of a Rayleigh number quantifying the
ratio of internal heating to diffusion and the Ekman number, $E$, which
quantifies the ratio of viscous diffusion to rotation. We utilise two different
estimates on the vertical velocity, $w$, one pointwise in the domain (Yan 2004,
J. Math. Phys., vol. 45(7), pp. 2718-2743) and the other an integral estimate
over the domain (Constantin et al . 1999, Phys. D: Non. Phen., vol. 125, pp.
275-284), resulting in bounds valid for different regions of
buoyancy-to-rotation dominated convection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
similar to rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, for small $E$, the critical
Rayleigh number for the onset of convection asymptotically scales as
$E^{-4/3}$.This result is combined with heuristic arguments for internally
heated and rotating convection to arrive at scaling laws for $\overline{\langle
T \rangle }$ and $\mathcal{F}_B$ valid for arbitrary Prandtl numbers.

Coupled cluster theory has had a momentous impact on the ab initio prediction
of molecular properties, and remains a staple ingratiate in high-accuracy
thermochemical model chemistries. However, these methods require inclusion of
at least some connected quadruple excitations, which generally scale at best as
$\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ with the number of basis functions. It very difficult to
predict, a priori, the effect correlation past CCSD(T) has on a give reaction
energies. The purpose of this work is to examine cost-effective quadruple
corrections based on the factorization theorem of many-body perturbation theory
that may address these challenges. We show that the $\mathcal{O}(N^7)$,
factorized CCSD(TQ${}_\text{f}$) method introduces minimal error to predicted
correlation and reaction energies as compared to the $\mathcal{O}(N^9)$
CCSD(TQ). Further, we examine the performance of Goodson's continued fraction
method in the estimation of CCSDT(Q)${}_\Lambda$ contributions to reaction
energies, as well as a "new" method related to %TAE[(T)] that we refer to as a
scaled perturbation estimator. We find that the scaled perturbation estimator
based upon CCSD(TQ${}_\text{f}$)/cc-pVDZ is capable of predicting
CCSDT(Q)${}_\Lambda$/cc-pVDZ contributions to reaction energies with an average
error of 0.07 kcal mol${}^{-1}$ and a RMST of 0.52 kcal mol${}^{-1}$ when
applied to a test-suite of nearly 3000 reactions. This offers a means by which
to reliably ballpark how important post-CCSD(T) contributions are to reaction
energies while incurring no more than CCSD(T) formal cost and a little mental
math.

Due to spatial scarcity and uncertainties in sediment data, initial and
boundary conditions in deep-time climate simulations are not well constrained.
On the other hand, the climate is a nonlinear system with a multitude of
feedback mechanisms that compete and balance differently depending on the
initial and boundary conditions. This opens up the possibility to obtain
multiple steady states under the same forcing in numerical experiments. Here,
we use the MIT general circulation model with a coupled
atmosphere-ocean-thermodynamic sea ice-land configuration to explore the
existence of such alternative steady states around the Permian-Triassic
Boundary (PTB). We construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram, taking into
account processes on a timescale of thousands of years, in order to identify
the stability range of the steady states and tipping points as the atmospheric
CO$_2$ content is varied. We find three alternative steady states with a
difference in global mean surface air temperature of about 10 $^\circ$C. We
also examine how these climatic steady states are modified when feedbacks
operating on comparable or longer time scales are included, in particular
vegetation dynamics and air-sea carbon exchanges. Our findings on
multistability provide a useful framework for explaining the climatic
variations observed in the Early Triassic geological record, as well as some
discrepancies between numerical simulations in the literature and geological
data at PTB and its aftermath.

Rational approximation has proven to be a powerful method for solving
two-dimensional (2D) fluid problems. At small Reynolds numbers, 2D Stokes flows
can be represented by two analytic functions, known as Goursat functions. Xue,
Waters and Trefethen [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46 (2024), pp. A1214-A1234]
recently introduced the LARS algorithm (Lightning-AAA Rational Stokes) for
computing 2D Stokes flows in general domains by approximating the Goursat
functions using rational functions. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm
for computing 2D Stokes flows in periodic channels using trigonometric rational
functions, with poles placed via the AAA-LS algorithm [Costa and Trefethen,
European Congr. Math., 2023] in a conformal map of the domain boundary. We
apply the algorithm to Poiseuille and Couette problems between various periodic
channel geometries, where solutions are computed to at least 6-digit accuracy
in less than 1 second. The applicability of the algorithm is highlighted in the
computation of the dynamics of fluid particles in unsteady Couette flows.

We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a
domain with moving boundary. In J. Math. Phys. 11, 2679 (1970), Moore
introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed
analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of
Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence
of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an
analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is
not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a
novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast
boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods,
our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at
many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two
variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation
or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.

We consider an interface with surface tension that separates a perfectly
conducting inviscid fluid from a vacuum. The fluid flow is governed by the
equations of ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), while the electric
and magnetic fields in vacuum satisfy the Maxwell equations. With boundary
conditions on the interface this forms a nonlinear hyperbolic problem with a
characteristic free boundary. For the corresponding linearized problem we
derive an energy a priori estimate in a conormal Sobolev space without assuming
any stability conditions on the unperturbed flow. This verifies the stabilizing
effect of surface tension because, as was shown in [Mandrik and Trakhinin, in
Commun. Math. Sci. 12 (2014), 1065-1100], a sufficiently large vacuum electric
field can make the linearized problem ill-posed for the case of zero surface
tension. The main ingredients in proving the energy estimate are a suitable
secondary symmetrization of the Maxwell equations in vacuum and making full use
of the boundary regularity enhanced from the surface tension.

While numerous indices of inter-coder reliability exist, Krippendorff's
{\alpha} and Cohen's \{kappa} have long dominated in communication studies and
other fields, respectively. The near consensus, however, may be near the end.
Recent theoretical and mathematical analyses reveal that these indices assume
intentional and maximal random coding, leading to paradoxes and inaccuracies. A
controlled experiment with one-way golden standard and Monte Carlo simulations
supports these findings, showing that \{kappa} and {\alpha} are poor predictors
and approximators of true intercoder reliability. As consensus on a perfect
index remains elusive, more authors recommend selecting the best available
index for specific situations (BAFS). To make informed choices, researchers,
reviewers, and educators need to understand the liberal-conservative hierarchy
of indices, i.e., which indices produce higher or lower scores. This study
extends previous efforts by expanding the math-based hierarchies to include 23
indices and constructing six additional hierarchies using Monte Carlo
simulations. These simulations account for factors like the number of
categories and distribution skew. The resulting eight hierarchies display a
consistent pattern and reveal a previously undetected paradox in the Ir index.

We are concerned with the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes equations
for a $\gamma$-law gas with density-dependent bulk viscosity coefficient
$\lambda=\lambda(\rho)=\rho^\beta$ on the two-dimensional periodic domain
$\mathbb{T}^2$. The global existence of weak solutions with initial density
bounded away from zero and infinity for $\beta>3$, $\gamma>1$ has been
established by Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov [Sib. Math. J. 36 (1995), 1283--1316].
When $\gamma=\beta>3$, the large-time behaviour of the weak solutions and, in
particular, the absence of formation of vacuum and concentration of density as
$t \to \infty$, has been proved by Perepelitsa [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 39
(2007/08), 1344--1365]. Huang--Li [J. Math. Pures Appl. 106 (2016), 123--154]
extended these results by establishing the global existence of weak solutions
and large-time behaviour under the assumptions $\beta >3/2$, $1<
\gamma<4\beta-3$, and that the initial density stays away from infinity (but
may contain vacuum).
  Improving upon the works listed above, we prove that in the regime of
parameters as in Huang--Li, namely that $\beta >3/2$ and $1< \gamma<4\beta-3$,
if the density has no vacuum or concentration at $t=0$, then it stays uniformly
away from zero and infinity at all later time $t \in ]0,\infty]$. Moreover,
under the mere assumption that $\beta>1$ and $\gamma>1$, we establish the
global existence of weak solutions, thus pushing the global existence theory of
the barotropic Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to the most general
setting to date. One of the key ingredients of our proof is a novel application
-- motivated by the recent work due to Danchin--Mucha [Comm. Pure Appl. Math.
76 (2023), 3437--3492] -- of Desjardins' logarithmic interpolation inequality.

The PAMPA (Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted) method, proposed in
[R. Abgrall, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5: 370-402, 2023], combines
conservative and non-conservative formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws
to evolve cell averages and point values. Solutions to hyperbolic conservation
laws typically have an invariant domain, and ensuring numerical solutions stay
within this domain is essential yet nontrivial. This paper presents a novel
framework for designing efficient Invariant-Domain-Preserving (IDP) PAMPA
schemes. We first analyze the IDP property for updated cell averages in the
original PAMPA scheme, revealing the role of cell average decomposition and
midpoint values in maintaining the invariant domain. This analysis highlights
the difficulty of relying on continuous fluxes alone to preserve the invariant
domain. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple IDP limiter for cell
midpoint values, and propose a provably IDP PAMPA scheme that guarantees the
preservation of the invariant domain for updated cell averages without
requiring post-processing limiters. This approach contrasts with existing
bound-preserving PAMPA schemes, which often require additional convex limiting
to blend high-order and low-order solutions. Most notably, inspired by the
Softplus and Clipped ReLU functions from machine learning, we propose an
automatic IDP reformulation of the governing equations, resulting in an
unconditionally limiter-free IDP scheme for evolving point values. We also
introduce techniques to suppress spurious oscillations, enabling the scheme to
capture strong shocks effectively. Numerical experiments on 1D problems,
including the linear convection equation, Burgers equation, the compressible
Euler equations, and MHD equations, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of
the proposed IDP PAMPA scheme.

The variational principle of V. I. Arnold [J. Appl. Math. Mech. Vol. 29, P.
1002 (1965)] is extended to the general conservative inhomogeneous,
compressible, and conducting fluid. The concept of iso-vortical flows is
generalized to an "invariant foliation" of the phase space. The foliation,
which may or may not correspond to explicit conservation laws, is derived from
the equations of motion and used for Lyapunov stability. A nonlinear
three-dimensional (magneto-) hydrodynamic stability criterion is formulated.

We present a new fluid-dynamical model of traffic flow. This model
generalizes the model of Aw and Rascle [SIAM J. Appl. Math. 60 916-938] and
Greenberg [SIAM J. Appl. Math 62 729-745] by prescribing a more general source
term to the velocity equation. This source term can be physically motivated by
experimental data, when taking into account relaxation and reaction time. In
particular, the new model has a (linearly) unstable regime as observed in
traffic dynamics. We develop a numerical code, which solves the corresponding
system of balance laws. Applying our code to a wide variety of initial data, we
find the observed inverse-$\lambda$ shape of the fundamental diagram of traffic
flow.

A method is given to obtain closed form formulas for the energy and forces
for an aggregate of charges interacting via a logarithmic interaction under
periodic boundary conditions. The work done here is a generalization of
Glasser's results [M. L. Glasser, J. Math. Phys. 15, 188 (1974)] and is
obtained with a different and simpler method than that by Stremler [M. A.
Stremler, J. Math. Phys. 45, 3584 (2004)]. The simplicity of the formulas
derived here makes them extremely convenient in a computer simulation.

In the field theories with twistor structure particles can be identified with
(spacially bounded) caustics of null geodesic congruences defined by the
twistor field. As a realization, we consider the ``algebrodynamical'' approach
based on the field equations which originate from noncommutative analysis (over
the algebra of biquaternions) and lead to the complex eikonal field and to the
set of gauge fields associated with solutions of the eikonal equation.
Particle-like formations represented by singularities of these fields possess
``elementary'' electric charge and other realistic ``quantum numbers'' and
manifest self-consistent time evolution including transmutations. Related
concepts of generating ``World Function'' and of multivalued physical fields
are discussed. The picture of Lorentz invariant light-formed aether and of
matter born from light arises then quite naturally. The notion of the Time Flow
identified with the flow of primodial light (``pre-Light'') is introduced in
the context. Popularization and development of the paper math-ph/0311006.

The Eigenvalue Moment Method (EMM), Handy (2001), Handy and Wang (2001)) is
applied to the $H_\alpha \equiv P^2 + iX^3 + i\alpha X$ Hamiltonian, enabling
the algebraic/numerical generation of converging bounds to the complex energies
of the $L^2$ states, as argued (through asymptotic methods) by Delabaere and
Trinh (J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. {\bf 33} 8771 (2000)).

We continue our study of colligative properties of solutions initiated in
math-ph/0407034. We focus on the situations where, in a system of linear size
$L$, the concentration and the chemical potential scale like $c=\xi/L$ and
$h=b/L$, respectively. We find that there exists a critical value $\xit$ such
that no phase separation occurs for $\xi\le\xit$ while, for $\xi>\xit$, the two
phases of the solvent coexist for an interval of values of $b$. Moreover, phase
separation begins abruptly in the sense that a macroscopic fraction of the
system suddenly freezes (or melts) forming a crystal (or droplet) of the
complementary phase when $b$ reaches a critical value. For certain values of
system parameters, under ``frozen'' boundary conditions, phase separation also
ends abruptly in the sense that the equilibrium droplet grows continuously with
increasing $b$ and then suddenly jumps in size to subsume the entire system.
Our findings indicate that the onset of freezing-point depression is in fact a
surface phenomenon.

Extending earlier work(*), we examine the deformation of the canonical
symplectic structure in a cotangent bundle $T^\star(\Q)$ by additional terms
implying the Poisson non-commutativity of both configuration and momentum
variables. In this short note, we claim this can be done consistently when $\Q$
is a Lie group. -- (*) F.J.Vanhecke, C.Sigaud and A.R.da Silva,

We continue our investigation of the nonlinear SUSY for complex potentials
started in the Part I (math-ph/0610024) and prove the theorems characterizing
its structure in the case of non-diagonalizable Hamiltonians. This part
provides the mathematical basis of previous studies. The classes of potentials
invariant under SUSY transformations for non-diagonalizable Hamiltonians are
specified and the asymptotics of formal eigenfunctions and associated functions
are derived. Several results on the normalizability of associated functions at
infinities are rigorously proved. Finally the Index Theorem on relation between
Jordan structures of intertwined Hamiltonians depending of the behavior of
elements of canonical basis of supercharge kernel at infinity is proven.

Classical billiards constitute an important class of dynamical systems. They
have not only been in used in mathematical disciplines such as ergodic theory,
but their properties demonstrate fundamental physical phenomena that can be
observed in laboratory settings. This document provides instructions for a
Matlab module that simulates classical billiard systems. It is intended to be
used as both a research and teaching tool. At present, the program efficiently
simulates tables that are constructed entirely from line segments and
elliptical arcs. It functions less reliably for tables with more complex
boundary components. The program and documentation can be downloaded from
\textit{http://www.math.gatech.edu/$\sim$mason/papers/}.

With tangent angle perturbation approach the axial symmetry deformation of a
spherical vesicle in large under the pressure changes is studied by the
elasticity theory of Helfrich spontaneous curvature model.Three main results in
axial symmetry shape: biconcave shape, peanut shape, and one type of myelin are
obtained. These axial symmetry morphology deformations are in agreement with
those observed in lipsome experiments by dark-field light microscopy [Hotani,
J. Mol. Biol. 178, (1984) 113] and in the red blood cell with two thin
filaments (myelin) observed in living state (see, Bessis, Living Blood Cells
and Their Ultrastructure, Springer-Verlag, 1973). Furthermore, the biconcave
shape and peanut shape can be simulated with the help of a powerful software,
Surface Evolver [Brakke, Exp. Math. 1, 141 (1992) 141], in which the
spontaneous curvature can be easy taken into account.

Using the canonical formalism, Compagno and Persico [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen.
35 (2002) 3629--45] have calculated the 'radiation-reaction' force on a uniform
spherical charge moving rigidly, slowly and slightly from its position at the
time when the transverse electric field is assumed to vanish. This force is
shown to result in the same time-averaged self-force as that which has been
obtained by different means for the test charge of a Bohr--Rosenfeld
field-measurement procedure and which Compagno and Persico claimed to be
incorrect.

Some mathematically incorrect claims of Compagno and Persico in their reply
(2002 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35, 8965) to my comment on their recent paper on
self-dressing and radiation reaction in classical electrodynamics are pointed
out.

The reality of neutrino oscillations has not really sunk in yet. The
phenomenon presents us with purely quantum mechanical effects over macroscopic
time and distance scales (milliseconds and 1000s of km). In order to help with
the pedagogical difficulties this poses, I attempt here to present the physics
in words and pictures rather than math. No disrespect is implied by the title;
I am merely borrowing a term used by a popular series of self-help books.

We define and compute the renormalized four-momentum of the composed physical
system: classical Maxwell field interacting with charged point particles. As a
`reference' configuration for the field surrounding the particle, we take the
Born solution. Unlike in the previous approach [Gen. Relat. Grav. 26 (1994)
167; Acta Phys. Pol. A 85 (1994) 771; Commun. Math. Phys. 198 (1998), 711],
based on the Coulomb `reference', a dependence of the four-momentum of the
particle (`dressed' with the Born solution) upon its acceleration arises in a
natural way. This will change the resulting equations of motion. Similarly, we
treat the angular momentum tensor of the system.

We study the Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock model introduced by Chaix and Iracane
({\it J. Phys. B.}, 22, 3791--3814, 1989) which is a mean-field theory deduced
from no-photon QED. The associated functional is bounded from below. In the
presence of an external field, a minimizer, if it exists, is interpreted as the
polarized vacuum and it solves a self-consistent equation.
  In a recent paper math-ph/0403005, we proved the convergence of the iterative
fixed-point scheme naturally associated with this equation to a global
minimizer of the BDF functional, under some restrictive conditions on the
external potential, the ultraviolet cut-off $\Lambda$ and the bare fine
structure constant $\alpha$. In the present work, we improve this result by
showing the existence of the minimizer by a variational method, for any cut-off
$\Lambda$ and without any constraint on the external field.
  We also study the behaviour of the minimizer as $\Lambda$ goes to infinity
and show that the theory is "nullified" in that limit, as predicted first by
Landau: the vacuum totally kills the external potential. Therefore the limit
case of an infinite cut-off makes no sense both from a physical and
mathematical point of view.
  Finally, we perform a charge and density renormalization scheme applying
simultaneously to all orders of the fine structure constant $\alpha$, on a
simplified model where the exchange term is neglected.

We present the first English translation of Einstein's original papers
related to the teleparallel ('absolute parallelism', 'distant parallelism' and
the German 'Fernparallelismus' are synonyms) attempt of an unified field theory
of gravitation and electromagnetism. Our collection contains the summarizing
paper in Math. Annal. 102 (1930) pp. 685-697 and 2 reports published in
'Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften' on June 7th,
1928 (pp. 217-221), June 14th, 1928 (pp. 224-227) and a precursor report (July
9th, 1925 pp. 414-419). To ease understanding, literature on tensor analysis is
quoted in the footnotes.

In a recent paper Ozdogan (Z. Naturforsch, 59a(2004)743) published formulas
for evaluating the two-center overlap and nuclear attraction integrals over
integer and noninteger Slater type orbitals. The purpose of this article is to
point out that the same formulas have previously been established by Guseinov
et al. (J.Mol.Model.,8(2002)272) by using the same method. As we demonstrated
in our Comment (Int.J.Quantum Chem., 91(2003)62), the expansion formula for the
product of two normalized associated Legendre functions in elliptical
coordinates and the expansion coefficients presented by Ozdogan are obtained
from the use of given in our papers general formulas (I.I.Guseinov,
J.Phys.,B,3(1970)1399; Phys.Rev.,A,32(1985)1864; J.Mol.Struct
(Theochem),336(1995)17) by changing the summation indices. It should be noted
that the published by Ozdogan results are on the use of formulas for the
evaluation of multicenter integrals presented in his other papers, which are
also obtained from the literature (see, e.g., C.C.J. Roothaan, J.Chem.Phys., 19
(1951) 1445; A.Lofthus, Mol. Phys., 5 (1962) 105) and our articles by changing
the summation indices (see Comments: I.I.Guseinov, Commun.Theor.Phys., 38
(2002) 256; Int.J.Quantum Chem., 91 (2003) 62; J.Math.Chem., 36 (2004) 123;

We discuss the nature of reality in the ontological context of Penrose's
math-matter-mind triangle. The triangle suggests the circularity of the
widespread view that math arises from the mind, the mind arises out of matter,
and that matter can be explained in terms of math. Non-physicists should be
wary of any claim that modern physics leads us to any particular resolution of
this circularity, since even the sample of three theoretical physicists writing
this paper hold three divergent views. Some physicists believe that current
physics has already found the basic framework for a complete description of
reality, and only has to fill in the details. Others suspect that no single
framework, from physics or other sources, will ever capture reality. Yet others
guess that reality might be approached arbitrarily closely by some form of
future physics, but probably based on completely different frameworks. We will
designate these three approaches as the fundamentalist, secular and mystic
views of the world, as seen by practicing physicists. We present and contrast
each of these views, which arguably form broad categories capturing most if not
all interpretations of physics. We argue that this diversity in the physics
community is more useful than an ontological monoculture, since it motivates
physicists to tackle unsolved problems with a wide variety of approaches.

Explicit solutions of the two-dimensional floating body problem (bodies that
can float in all positions) for relative density rho different from 1/2 and of
the tire track problem (tire tracks of a bicycle, which do not allow to
determine, which way the bicycle went) are given, which differ from circles.
Starting point is the differential equation given in archive physics/0205059
and Studies in Appl. Math. 111 (2003) 167-183.

We analyze low-energy scattering of positrons on Ar atoms and N2 molecules
using Modified Effective-Range Theory (MERT) developped by O'Malley, Spruch and
Rosenberg [Journal of Math. Phys. 2, 491 (1961)]. We use formulation of MERT
based on exact solutions of Schroedinger equation with polarization potential
rather than low-energy expansions of phase shifts into momentum series. We show
that MERT describes well experimental data, provided that effective-range
expansion is performed both for s- and p-wave scattering, which dominate in the
considered regime of positron energies (0.4 - 2 eV). We estimate the values of
the s-wave scattering lenght and the effective range for e+ - Ar and e+ - N2
collisions.

Considering the contributions of the main term of the relativistic Coulombian
Green function given by Hostler [J. Math. Phys, 5, 591 (1964)] to the second
order of the S-matrix element and taking into account only the large components
of Dirac spinor of the 2S subshell, we have obtained the imaginary part of the
Rayleigh amplitudes in terms of elementary functions. Thereby, simple and high
accurate formulae for the total cross-sections for photoeffect and pair
production with the electron created in the 2S subshell are obtained via the
optical theorem. Comparing the predictions given by our formulae with the full
relativistic numerical calculations of Kissel et al [Phys. Rev. A 22, 1970
(1980)] and Scofield [LLRL, Internal Report (1973)], a good agreement is found
for low and intermediate Z values if screening effects are taken into account,
for photon energies above the pair production threshold energy. We present our
numerical results for the total photoeffect and pair production cross-sections
for the 2S subshell of Zn and Ag atoms, for various photon energies.

Mathematics is an essential element of physics problem solving, but experts
often fail to appreciate exactly how they use it. Math may be the language of
science, but math-in-physics is a distinct dialect of that language. Physicists
tend to blend conceptual physics with mathematical symbolism in a way that
profoundly affects the way equations are used and interpreted. Research with
university physics students in classes from algebra-based introductory physics
indicates that the gap between what students think they are supposed to be
doing and what their instructors expect them to do can cause severe problems.

We make remarks on Fern\'{a}ndez Guasti's paper [{\it J. Phys. A: Math. Gen.}
39 (2006) 11825-11832] by pointing out some mistakes Fern\'{a}ndez Guasti
derived therein.

We review the basic kinetic wealth-exchange models of Angle [J. Angle, Social
Forces 65 (1986) 293; J. Math. Sociol. 26 (2002) 217], Bennati [E. Bennati,
Rivista Internazionale di Scienze Economiche e Commerciali 35 (1988) 735],
Chakraborti and Chakrabarti [A. Chakraborti, B. K. Chakrabarti, Eur. Phys. J. B
17 (2000) 167], and of Dragulescu and Yakovenko [A. Dragulescu, V. M.
Yakovenko, Eur. Phys. J. B 17 (2000) 723]. Analytical fitting forms for the
equilibrium wealth distributions are proposed. The influence of heterogeneity
is investigated, the appearance of the fat tail in the wealth distribution and
the relaxation to equilibrium are discussed. A unified reformulation of the
models considered is suggested.

Explicit solutions of the two-dimensional floating body problem (bodies that
can float in all positions) for relative density different from 1/2 and of the
tire track problem (tire tracks of a bicycle, which do not allow to determine,
which way the bicycle went) are given, which differ from circles. Starting
point is the differential equation given by the author in archive
physics/0205059 and Studies in Appl. Math. 111 (2003) 167-183. The curves are
also trajectories of charges in a perpendicular magnetic field.

A formula of Doetsch ({\em Math. Zeitschr.} {\bf 42}, 263 (1937)) is
generalized and used to numerically invert the one-sided Laplace transform
${\hat C}(\beta)$. The necessary input is only the values of ${\hat C}(\beta)$
on the positive real axis. The method is applicable provided that the functions
$\hat{C}(\beta)$ belong to the function space $L^2_\alpha$ defined by the
condition that $ G(x) = e^{x\alpha}\hat{C}(e^x),~ \alpha > 0$ has to be square
integrable. This space includes sums of exponential decays ${\hat
C}(\beta)=\sum_n^{\infty}a_n e^{-\beta E_n}$, e.g. partition functions with
$a_n = 1$. In practice, the inversion algorithm consists of two subsequent fast
Fourier transforms. High accuracy inverted data can be obtained, provided that
the signal is also highly accurate. The method is demonstrated for a harmonic
partition function and resonant transmission through a barrier. We find
accurately inverted functions even in the presence of noise.

Closure relations satisfied by the radial Dirac-Coulomb Sturmians are proved
analytically. The Sturmian expansion of the Dirac-Coulomb Green function is
transformed to the form containing only series with summations running over
non-negative indices. The main paper was published in J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt.
Phys. 30 (1997) 825-61 [Erratum: 30 (1997) 2747], see also J. Phys. A: Math.
Gen. 31 (1998) 4963--90 [Erratum: 31 (1998) 7415-6].

The paper contains further development of the idea of field quantization
introduced in M. Czachor, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. {\bf 33} (2000) 8081-8103. The
formalism is extended to the relativistic domain. The link to the standard
theory is obtained via a thermodynamic limit. Unitary representations of the
Poincar\'e group at the level of fields and states are explicitly given.
Non-canonical multi-photon and coherent states are introduced. In the
thermodynamic limit the statistics of photons in a coherent state is
Poissonian. The $S$ matrix of radiation fields produced by a classical current
is given by a non-canonical coherent-state displacement operator, a fact
automatically eliminating the infrared catastrophe. Field operators are shown
to be operators and not operator-valued distributions, and can be multiplied at
the same point in configuration space. An exactly solvable example is used to
compare predictions of the standard theory with those of non-canonical quantum
optics, and explicitly shows the mechanism of automatic ultraviolet
regularization occuring in the non-canonical theory. Similar conclusions are
obtained in perturbation theory, where one finds the standard Feynman diagrams,
but the Feynman rules are modified. A comparison with the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb model
allows to identify the physical structure behind the non-canonical algebra as
corresponding to an ensemble of indefinite-frequency oscillators with constant
density $N/V$.

A semidomain is a subsemiring of an integral domain. Within this class, a
unique factorization semidomain (UFS) is characterized by the property that
every nonzero, nonunit element can be factored into a product of finitely many
prime elements. In this paper, we investigate the localization of semidomains,
focusing specifically on UFSs. We demonstrate that the localization of a UFS
remains a UFS, leading to the conclusion that a UFS is either a unique
factorization domain or is additively reduced. In addition, we provide an
example of a subsemiring $\mathfrak{S}$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that
$(\mathfrak{S}, \cdot)$ and $(\mathfrak{S}, +)$ are both half-factorial,
shedding light on a conjecture posed by Baeth, Chapman, and Gotti.

The notion of a Jacobi manifold is a natural generalization of that of a
Poisson manifold. A Jacobi manifold has a natural foliation in which each leaf
has either a contact structure or a locally conformal symplectic structure. In
this paper, we study a characteristic class called the Godbillon-Vey class for
Jacobi manifolds with regular foliation and express it explicitly in terms of
Jacobi structures.

The opaque nature of transformer-based models, particularly in applications
susceptible to unethical practices such as dark-patterns in user interfaces,
requires models that integrate uncertainty quantification to enhance trust in
predictions. This study focuses on dark-pattern detection, deceptive design
choices that manipulate user decisions, undermining autonomy and consent. We
propose a differential fine-tuning approach implemented at the final
classification head via uncertainty quantification with transformer-based
pre-trained models. Employing a dense neural network (DNN) head architecture as
a baseline, we examine two methods capable of quantifying uncertainty:
Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) and Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs). These methods are evaluated on a set of open-source
foundational models across multiple dimensions: model performance, variance in
certainty of predictions and environmental impact during training and inference
phases. Results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty quantification
maintains performance while providing insights into challenging instances
within the models. Moreover, the study reveals that the environmental impact
does not uniformly increase with the incorporation of uncertainty
quantification techniques. The study's findings demonstrate that uncertainty
quantification enhances transparency and provides measurable confidence in
predictions, improving the explainability and clarity of black-box models. This
facilitates informed decision-making and mitigates the influence of
dark-patterns on user interfaces. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques in developing machine
learning models, particularly in domains where interpretability and
trustworthiness are critical.

We discuss elements of a social history of the theory of projective modules
over commutative rings. We attempt to study the question: how did the theory of
projective modules become one of "mainstream" focus in mathematics? To do this,
we begin in what one might call the pre-history of projective modules,
describing the mathematical culture into which the notion of projective module
was released. These recollections involve four pieces: (a) analyzing aspects of
the theory of fiber bundles, as it impinges on algebraic geometry, (b)
understanding the rise of homological techniques in algebraic topology, (c)
describing the influence of category-theoretic ideas in topology and algebra
and (d) revisiting the story of the percolation of sheaf-theoretic ideas
through algebraic geometry.
  We will then argue that it was this unique confluence of mathematical events
that allowed projective modules to emerge as objects of central mathematical
importance. More precisely, we will first argue that, in the context of social
currents of the time, projective modules initially were isolated as objects of
purely technical convenience reflecting the aesthetic sensibilities of the
creators of the fledgling theory of homological algebra. Only later did they
transcend this limited role to become objects of "mainstream importance" due to
influence from the theory of algebraic fiber bundles and the theory of sheaves.
Along the way, we aim to show how strong personal ties emanating from the
Bourbaki movement and its connections in mathematical centers including Paris,
Princeton and Chicago were essential to the entrance, propagation and
mainstream mathematical acceptance of the theory.

Side channels have become an essential component of many modern
information-theoretic schemes. The emerging field of cross technology
communications (CTC) provides practical methods for creating intentional side
channels between existing communications technologies. This paper describes a
theoretical foundation for one such, recently proposed, CTC scheme: Ghost
Modulation (GM). Designed to modulate a low-data-rate message atop an existing
network stream, GM is particularly suited for transmitting identification or
covert information. The implementation only requires firmware updates to
existing hardware, making it a cost-effective solution. However, GM provides an
interesting technical challenge due to a highly asymmetric binary crossover
erasure channel (BCEC) that results from packet drops and network delays. In
this work, we provide a mathematical description of the signal and channel
models for GM. A heuristic decision rule based on maximum-likelihood principles
for simplified channel models is proposed. We describe an algorithm for GM
packet acquisition and timing synchronization, supported by simulation results.
Several well known short block codes are applied, and bit error rate (BER)
results are presented.

In this paper, we study simultaneous determination of the strain hardening
exponent, the shear modulus and the yield stress in an inverse problem. First,
we analyze the direct and the inverse problems. Then we formulate the inverse
problem in the Bayesian framework. After solving the direct problem by an
iterative approach, we propose a numerical method based on a Bayesian approach
for the numerical solution of the inverse problem. Numerical examples with
noisy data illustrate applicability and accuracy of the proposed method to some
extent.\

We establish general conditions under which there exists uniform in time
convergence between a stochastic process and its approximated system. These
standardised conditions consist of a local in time estimate between the
original and the approximated process as well as of a contraction property for
one of the processes and a uniform control for the other one. Specifically, the
results we present provide global in time error bounds for multiscale methods
and numerical discretisations as well as uniform in time propagation of chaos
bounds for mean-field particle systems. We provide a general method of proof
which can be applied to many types of approximation. In all three scenarios,
examples where the joint conditions are verified and uniform in time
convergence is achieved are given.

In this paper we study the rigidity problem for sub-static systems with
possibly non-empty boundary. First, we get local and global splitting theorems
by assuming the existence of suitable compact minimal hypersurfaces,
complementing recent results in the literature. Next, we prove some boundary
integral inequalities that extend works by Chr\'usciel and
Boucher-Gibbons-Horowitz to non-vacuum spaces. Even in the vacuum static case,
the inequalities improve on known ones. Lastly, we consider the system arising
from static solutions to the Einstein field equations coupled with a
$\sigma$-model. The Liouville theorem we obtain allows for positively curved
target manifolds, generalizing a result by Reiris.

Risk measures, which typically evaluate the impact of extreme losses, are
highly sensitive to misspecification in the tails. This paper studies a robust
optimization approach to combat tail uncertainty by proposing a unifying
framework to construct uncertainty sets for a broad class of risk measures,
given a specified nominal model. Our framework is based on a parametrization of
robust risk measures using two (or multiple) $\phi$-divergence functions, which
enables us to provide uncertainty sets that are tailored to both the
sensitivity of each risk measure to tail losses and the tail behavior of the
nominal distribution. In addition, our formulation allows for a tractable
computation of robust risk measures, and elicitation of $\phi$-divergences that
describe a decision maker's risk and ambiguity preferences.

This study presents the conditional neural fields for reduced-order modeling
(CNF-ROM) framework to approximate solutions of parametrized partial
differential equations (PDEs). The approach combines a parametric neural ODE
(PNODE) for modeling latent dynamics over time with a decoder that reconstructs
PDE solutions from the corresponding latent states. We introduce a
physics-informed learning objective for CNF-ROM, which includes two key
components. First, the framework uses coordinate-based neural networks to
calculate and minimize PDE residuals by computing spatial derivatives via
automatic differentiation and applying the chain rule for time derivatives.
Second, exact initial and boundary conditions (IC/BC) are imposed using
approximate distance functions (ADFs) [Sukumar and Srivastava, CMAME, 2022].
However, ADFs introduce a trade-off as their second- or higher-order
derivatives become unstable at the joining points of boundaries. To address
this, we introduce an auxiliary network inspired by [Gladstone et al., NeurIPS
ML4PS workshop, 2022]. Our method is validated through parameter extrapolation
and interpolation, temporal extrapolation, and comparisons with analytical
solutions.

Any profinite isomorphism between two cusped finite-volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds carries profinite isomorphisms between their Dehn fillings. With
this observation, we prove that some cusped finite-volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds are profinitely rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds,
through detecting their exceptional Dehn fillings. In addition, we improved a
criteria for profinite rigidity of a hyperbolic knot complement or a
hyperbolic-type satellite knot complement among compact, orientable
3-manifolds, through examining its characterising slopes. We obtain the
following profinitely rigid examples: the complement of the Whitehead link,
Whitehead sister link, $\frac{3}{10}$ two-bridge link; specific surgeries on
one component of these links; the complement of (full) twist knots
$\mathcal{K}_n$, Eudave-Mu\~noz knots $K(3,1,n,0)$, Pretzel knots
$P(-3,3,2n+1)$, $5_2$ knot; the Berge manifold, and many more.

A new method is introduced to derive general recurrence relations for
off-shell Bethe vectors in quantum integrable models with either type
$\mathfrak{gl}_n$ or type $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ symmetries. These recurrence
relations describe how to add a single parameter, $z$, to specific subsets of
Bethe parameters, expressing the resulting Bethe vector as a linear combination
of monodromy matrix entries that act on Bethe vectors which do not depend on
$z$. We refer to these recurrence relations as \textit{rectangular} because the
monodromy matrix entries involved are drawn from the upper-right rectangular
part of the matrix. This construction is achieved within the framework of the
zero mode method.

This paper deals with the large-scale behaviour of nonlinear minimum-cost
flow problems on random graphs. In such problems, a random nonlinear cost
functional is minimised among all flows (discrete vector-fields) with a
prescribed net flux through each vertex. On a stationary random graph embedded
in $\mathbb{R}^d$, our main result asserts that these problems converge, in the
large-scale limit, to a continuous minimisation problem where an effective cost
functional is minimised among all vector fields with prescribed divergence. Our
main result is formulated using $\Gamma$-convergence and applies to
multi-species problems. The proof employs the blow-up technique by Fonseca and
M\"uller in a discrete setting. One of the main challenges overcome is the
construction of the homogenised energy density on random graphs without a
periodic structure.

We use the determinant method of Bombieri-Pila and Heath-Brown and its
Arakelov reformulation by Chen utilizing Bost's slope method to estimate the
number of hypersurfaces required to cover the regular rational points with
bounded Arakelov height on a projective variety. Using complex cellular
structures introduced by Binyamini-Novikov, we replace the usual subpolynomial
factor by a polylogarithmic factor in the estimation.

We propose a novel method that solves global optimization problems in two
steps: (1) perform a (exponential) power-$N$ transformation to the
not-necessarily differentiable objective function $f$ to obtain $f_N$, and (2)
optimize the Gaussian-smoothed $f_N$ with stochastic approximations. Under mild
conditions on $f$, for any $\delta>0$, we prove that with a sufficiently large
power $N_\delta$, this method converges to a solution in the
$\delta$-neighborhood of $f$'s global maximum point. The convergence rate is
$O(d^2\sigma^4\varepsilon^{-2})$, which is faster than both the standard and
single-loop homotopy methods. Extensive experiments show that our method
requires significantly fewer iterations than other compared algorithms to
produce a high-quality solution.

Go-or-grow approaches represent a specific class of mathematical models used
to describe populations where individuals either migrate or reproduce, but not
both simultaneously. These models have a wide range of applications in biology
and medicine, chiefly among those the modeling of brain cancer spread. The
analysis of go-or-grow models has inspired new mathematics, and it is the
purpose of this review to highlight interesting and challenging mathematical
properties of reaction--diffusion models of the go-or-grow type. We provide a
detailed review of biological and medical applications before focusing on key
results concerning solution existence and uniqueness, pattern formation,
critical domain size problems, and traveling waves. We present new general
results related to the critical domain size and traveling wave problems, and we
connect these findings to the existing literature. Moreover, we demonstrate the
high level of instability inherent in go-or-grow models. We argue that there is
currently no accurate numerical solver for these models, and emphasize that
special care must be taken when dealing with the "monster on a leash".

We prove, by using elimination from algebraic geometry, that the only set
$S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, $\left|S\right|=6$ such that all subsets that build a
triangle are isosceles triangles, is the regular pentagon with its center.

In this article, from the viewpoint of control theory, we discuss the
relationships among the commonly used monotonicity conditions that ensure the
well-posedness of the solutions arising from problems of mean field games
(MFGs) and mean field type control (MFTC). We first introduce the
well-posedness of general forward-backward stochastic differential equations
(FBSDEs) defined on some suitably chosen Hilbert spaces under the
$\beta$-monotonicity. We then propose a monotonicity condition for the MFG,
namely partitioning the running cost functional into two parts, so that both
parts still depend on the control and the state distribution, yet one satisfies
a strong convexity and a small mean field effect condition, while the other has
a newly introduced displacement quasi-monotonicity. To the best of our
knowledge, the latter quasi type condition has not yet been discussed in the
contemporary literature, and it can be considered as a bit more general
monotonicity condition than those commonly used. Besides, for the MFG, we show
that convexity and small mean field effect condition for the first part of
running cost functional and the quasi-monotonicity condition for the second
part together imply the $\beta$-monotonicity and thus the well-posedness for
the associated FBSDEs. For the MFTC problem, we show that the
$\beta$-monotonicity for the corresponding FBSDEs is simply the convexity
assumption on the cost functional. Finally, we consider a more general setting
where the drift functional is allowed to be non-linear for both MFG and MFTC
problems.

An unsplittable multiflow routes the demand of each commodity along a single
path from its source to its sink node. As our main result, we prove that in
series-parallel digraphs, any given multiflow can be expressed as a convex
combination of unsplittable multiflows, where the total flow on any arc
deviates from the given flow by less than the maximum demand of any commodity.
This result confirms a 25-year-old conjecture by Goemans for single-source
unsplittable flows, as well as a stronger recent conjecture by Morell and
Skutella, for series-parallel digraphs - even for general multiflow instances
where commodities have distinct source and sink nodes. Previously, no
non-trivial class of digraphs was known for which either conjecture holds. En
route to proving this result, we also establish strong integrality results for
multiflows on series-parallel digraphs, showing that their computation can be
reduced to a simple single-commodity network flow problem.

Let $(M,d)$ be a complete metric space and let $\mathcal{F}(M)$ denote the
Lipschitz-free space over $M$. We develop a ``Choquet theory of Lipshitz-free
spaces'' that draws from the classical Choquet theory and the De Leeuw
representation of elements of $\mathcal{F}(M)$ (and its bidual) by positive
Radon measures on $\beta\widetilde{M}$, where $\widetilde{M}$ is the space of
pairs $(x,y) \in M \times M$, $x \neq y$. We define a quasi-order
$\preccurlyeq$ on the positive Radon measures on $\beta\widetilde{M}$ that is
analogous to the classical Choquet order. Rather than in the classical case
where the focus lies on maximal measures, we study the $\preccurlyeq$-minimal
measures and show that they have a host of desirable properties. Among the
applications of this theory is a solution (given elsewhere) to the extreme
point problem for Lipschitz-free spaces.

While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained
an open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on
quantum computers. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform
(QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\times N$ discrete Laplace
transforms on quantum states encoded in $\lceil \log_2(N)\rceil$-qubits. In
many cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$
as $O(\log(\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\log(N))$, requiring
exponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time
than their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the
possibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace
transforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry,
machine learning, and finance.

We construct defects describing the transition between different phases of
gauged linear sigma models with higher rank abelian gauge groups, as well as
defects embedding these phases into the GLSMs. Our construction refers entirely
to the sector protected by B-type supersymmetry, decoupling the gauge sector.
It relies on an abstract characterization of such transition defects and does
not involve an actual perturbative analysis. It turns out that the choices that
are required to characterize consistent transition defects match with the
homotopy classes of paths between different phases. Our method applies to
non-anomalous as well as anomalous GLSMs, and we illustrate both cases with
examples. This includes the GLSM associated to the resolution of the $A_N$
singularity and one describing the entire parameter space of $N = 2$ minimal
models, in particular, the relevant flows between them. Via fusion with
boundary conditions, the defects we construct yield functors describing the
transport of D-branes on parameter space. We find that our results match with
known results on D-brane transport.

The Frobenius manifold structure on the space of rational functions with
multiple simple poles is constructed. In particular, the dependence of the
Saito-flat coordinates on the flat coordinates of the intersection form is
studied. While some of the individual flat coordinates are complicated rational
functions, they appear in the prepotential in certain combinations known as
diagonal invariants, which turn out to be polynomial. Two classes are studied
in more detail. These are generalisations of the Coxeter and
extended-affine-Weyl orbits space for the group $W=W(A_\ell)\,.$ An invariant
theory is also developed.

For a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb R^d$, for any $d\ge 2$, a hyperplane
$h$ is called $k$-rich with respect to $P$ if it contains at least $k$ points
of $P$. Answering and generalizing a question asked by Peyman Afshani, we show
that if the number of $k$-rich hyperplanes in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 3$, is at
least $\Omega(n^d/k^\alpha + n/k)$, with a sufficiently large constant of
proportionality and with $d\le \alpha < 2d-1$, then there exists a $(d-2)$-flat
that contains $\Omega(k^{(2d-1-\alpha)/(d-1)})$ points of $P$. We also present
upper bound constructions that give instances in which the above lower bound is
tight. An extension of our analysis yields similar lower bounds for $k$-rich
spheres or $k$-rich flats.

We show that the $X$-torsion order of a knot, which is defined in terms of a
generalised Lee complex, can be calculated using the reduced
Bar-Natan--Lee--Turner spectral sequence. We use this for extensive
calculations, including an example of $X$-torsion order $4$.

The Max-k-Cut problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge
that generalizes the classic NP-complete Max-Cut problem. While relaxation
techniques are commonly employed to tackle Max-k-Cut, they often lack
guarantees of equivalence between the solutions of the original problem and its
relaxation. To address this issue, we introduce the Relax-Optimize-and-Sample
(ROS) framework. In particular, we begin by relaxing the discrete constraints
to the continuous probability simplex form. Next, we pre-train and fine-tune a
graph neural network model to efficiently optimize the relaxed problem.
Subsequently, we propose a sampling-based construction algorithm to map the
continuous solution back to a high-quality Max-k-Cut solution. By integrating
geometric landscape analysis with statistical theory, we establish the
consistency of function values between the continuous solution and its mapped
counterpart. Extensive experimental results on random regular graphs and the
Gset benchmark demonstrate that the proposed ROS framework effectively scales
to large instances with up to 20000 nodes in just a few seconds, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, ROS exhibits strong generalization
capabilities across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances,
underscoring its effectiveness for large-scale optimization tasks.

In recent years, deep learning, powered by neural networks, has achieved
widespread success in solving high-dimensional problems, particularly those
with low-dimensional feature structures. This success stems from their ability
to identify and learn low dimensional features tailored to the problems.
Understanding how neural networks extract such features during training
dynamics remains a fundamental question in deep learning theory. In this work,
we propose a novel perspective by interpreting the neurons in the last hidden
layer of a neural network as basis functions that represent essential features.
To explore the linear independence of these basis functions throughout the deep
learning dynamics, we introduce the concept of 'effective rank'. Our extensive
numerical experiments reveal a notable phenomenon: the effective rank increases
progressively during the learning process, exhibiting a staircase-like pattern,
while the loss function concurrently decreases as the effective rank rises. We
refer to this observation as the 'staircase phenomenon'. Specifically, for deep
neural networks, we rigorously prove the negative correlation between the loss
function and effective rank, demonstrating that the lower bound of the loss
function decreases with increasing effective rank. Therefore, to achieve a
rapid descent of the loss function, it is critical to promote the swift growth
of effective rank. Ultimately, we evaluate existing advanced learning
methodologies and find that these approaches can quickly achieve a higher
effective rank, thereby avoiding redundant staircase processes and accelerating
the rapid decline of the loss function.

The article develops a parametric model of fairness called
"$\varepsilon$-fairness" that can be represented using a single second-order
cone constraint and incorporated into existing decision-making problem
formulations without impacting the complexity of solution techniques. We
develop the model from the fundamental result of finite-dimensional norm
equivalence in linear algebra and show that this model has a closed-form
relationship to an existing metric for measuring fairness widely used in the
literature. Finally, a simple case study on the optimal operation of a damaged
power transmission network illustrates its effectiveness.

We study the strong approximation of the solutions to singular stochastic
kinetic equations (also referred to as second-order SDEs) driven by
$\alpha$-stable processes, using an Euler-type scheme inspired by [11]. For
these equations, the stability index $\alpha$ lies in the range $(1,2)$, and
the drift term exhibits anisotropic $\beta$-H\"older continuity with $\beta >1
- \frac{\alpha}{2}$. We establish a convergence rate of $(\frac{1}{2} +
\frac{\beta}{\alpha(1+\alpha)} \wedge \frac{1}{2})$, which aligns with the
results in [4] concerning first-order SDEs.

We establish the integral kernel associated with the Koecher-Maass series of
degree three twisted by an Eisenstein series. We prove that such a kernel
admits an analytic continuation and determine its functional equations. We find
a second representation of this kernel using Poincar\'e series. As an
application, we give another proof of the analytic properties for the twisted
Koecher-Maass series. Furthermore, we generalize a result due to Siegel related
to the Lipschitz summation formula on the Siegel space of degree three.

We study optimal control of PDEs under uncertainty with the state variable
subject to joint chance constraints. The controls are deterministic, but the
states are probabilistic due to random variables in the governing equation.
Joint chance constraints ensure that the random state variable meets pointwise
bounds with high probability. For linear governing PDEs and elliptically
distributed random parameters, we prove existence and uniqueness results for
almost-everywhere state bounds. Using the spherical-radial decomposition (SRD)
of the uncertain variable, we prove that when the probability is very large or
small, the resulting Monte Carlo estimator for the chance constraint
probability exhibits substantially reduced variance compared to the standard
Monte Carlo estimator. We further illustrate how the SRD can be leveraged to
efficiently compute derivatives of the probability function, and discuss
different expansions of the uncertain variable in the governing equation.
Numerical examples for linear and bilinear PDEs compare the performance of
Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling methods, examining probability
estimation convergence as the number of samples increases. We also study how
the accuracy of the probabilities depends on the truncation of the random
variable expansion, and numerically illustrate the variance reduction of the
SRD.

This paper is concerned with lattice field models in dimension at least 2.
The action is a uniformly convex function of the gradient of the field. The
main result Theorem 1.4 proves that charge-charge correlations in the Coulomb
dipole gas are close to Gaussian. These results go beyond previous results of
Dimock-Hurd and Conlon-Spencer. The approach in the paper is based on the
observation that the sine-Gordon probability measure corresponding to the
dipole gas is the invariant measure for a certain stochastic dynamics. The
stochastic dynamics here differs from the stochastic dynamics in previous work
used to study the problem.

We investigate birational properties of hypersurfaces of degree $6$ in the
weighted projective space $\mathbf{P}(1,1,2,2,3)$. In particular, we prove that
any such quasi-smooth hypersurface is not rational.

We derive universal approximation results for the class of (countably)
$m$-rectifiable measures. Specifically, we prove that $m$-rectifiable measures
can be approximated as push-forwards of the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on
$[0,1]$ using ReLU neural networks with arbitrarily small approximation error
in terms of Wasserstein distance. What is more, the weights in the networks
under consideration are quantized and bounded and the number of ReLU neural
networks required to achieve an approximation error of $\varepsilon$ is no
larger than $2^{b(\varepsilon)}$ with
$b(\varepsilon)=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-m}\log^2(\varepsilon))$. This result
improves Lemma IX.4 in Perekrestenko et al. as it shows that the rate at which
$b(\varepsilon)$ tends to infinity as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero equals the
rectifiability parameter $m$, which can be much smaller than the ambient
dimension. We extend this result to countably $m$-rectifiable measures and show
that this rate still equals the rectifiability parameter $m$ provided that,
among other technical assumptions, the measure decays exponentially on the
individual components of the countably $m$-rectifiable support set.

Real-world clinical decision making is a complex process that involves
balancing the risks and benefits of treatments. Quality-adjusted lifetime is a
composite outcome that combines patient quantity and quality of life, making it
an attractive outcome in clinical research. We propose methods for constructing
optimal treatment length strategies to maximize this outcome. Existing methods
for estimating optimal treatment strategies for survival outcomes cannot be
applied to a quality-adjusted lifetime due to induced informative censoring. We
propose a weighted estimating equation that adjusts for both confounding and
informative censoring. We also propose a nonparametric estimator of the mean
counterfactual quality-adjusted lifetime survival curve under a given treatment
length strategy, where the weights are estimated using an undersmoothed
sieve-based estimator. We show that the estimator is asymptotically linear and
provide a data-dependent undersmoothing criterion. We apply our method to
obtain the optimal time for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion in
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Phylogenetic networks are useful in representing the evolutionary history of
taxa. In certain scenarios, one requires a way to compare different networks.
In practice, this can be rather difficult, except within specific classes of
networks. In this paper, we derive metrics for the class of \emph{orchard
networks} and the class of \emph{strongly reticulation-visible} networks, from
variants of so-called \emph{$\mu$-representations}, which are vector
representations of networks. For both network classes, we impose degree
constraints on the vertices, by considering \emph{semi-binary} networks.

We extend results for the K-theory of Hecke algebras of reductive $p$-adic
groups to completed Kac-Moody groups.

We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by
time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a
systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that
exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or
observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their
extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models
of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or
reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically
admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers.
Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in
Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we
show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that
leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively
benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to
condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate
how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in
central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization
transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error
dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.

Comparative analysis between a network and a random graph model can uncover
network properties that significantly deviate from those in random networks.
The standard random graph model used for comparison uniformly samples random
graphs with the same degrees as the network data, often achieved through
edge-swap algorithms. However, for hypergraphs, fewer such methodologies are
available. This study introduces the Hypercurveball algorithm, designed to
sample random, potentially directed, hypergraphs with fixed degrees. Minor
adjustments enable the sampling of hypergraphs without degenerate hyperedges,
self-loops, or multi-hyperedges. For most of these algorithms, we prove whether
they sample uniformly or with bias. We experimentally show that the
Hypercurveball algorithm can be significantly faster or slower than the
standard hyperedge-shuffling algorithm, which is the hyperedge-equivalent of
the edge-swap algorithm. We present criteria on the hypergraph degree sequence
that indicate when the Hypercurveball algorithm is more efficient than the
standard hyperedge swap method. Finally, our preliminary experimental results
suggest polynomial scaling of the mixing time for both the Hypercurveball and
hyperedge-shuffling algorithms.

Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed
field $k$ of characteristic $p > 0$ and let $\ell$ be a prime number different
from $p$. Let $U \subseteq G$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup, $T$ a maximal
torus normalizing $U$ and $W$ the Weyl group of $G$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a
non-degenerate multiplicative $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell} $-local system on
$U$. In \cite{bd}, the authors show that the bi-Whittaker category, namely the
triangulated monoidal category of $(U, \mathcal{L})$-biequivariant
$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell}$-complexes on $G$ is monoidally equivalent to an
explicit thick triangulated monoidal subcategory $\mathscrsfs{D}_{W}^{\circ}(T)
\subseteq \mathscrsfs{D}_{W}(T)$ of "central sheaves" on the torus. In
particular it has the structure of a symmetric monoidal category coming from
the symmetric monoidal structure on $\mathscrsfs{D}_W(T)$.
  In this paper, we give another construction of a symmetric monoidal structure
on the above category and prove that it agrees with the one coming from the
above construction. For this, among other things, we generalize a proof by
Gelfand (ref. \cite{car}) for finite groups to the geometric setup.

In this work, we describe a prenormal form for the generators of the
semigroup of a toric variety $X \subset \mathbb{C}^p$ with isolated singularity
at the origin and smooth normalization. A complete description of the semigroup
is given when $X$ is a variety of dimension $n$ in $\mathbb{C}^{2n}$. Moreover,
for toric surfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$, we provide a set of generators of the
ideal $I$ defining $X$.

We discuss vertex patch smoothers as overlapping domain decomposition methods
for fourth order elliptic partial differential equations. We show that they are
numerically very efficient and yield high convergence rates. Furthermore, we
discuss low rank tensor approximations for their efficient implementation. Our
experiments demonstrate that the inexact local solver yields a method which
converges fast and uniformly with respect to mesh refinement. The
multiplicative smoother shows superior performance in terms of solution
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations. However, in three-dimensional cases,
the additive smoother outperforms its multiplicative counterpart due to the
latter's lower potential for parallelism. Additionally, the solver
infrastructure supports a mixed-precision approach, executing the multigrid
preconditioner in single precision while performing the outer iteration in
double precision, thereby increasing throughput by up to 70 percent.

We give a new example of potential density of rational points on the third
punctual Hilbert scheme of a K3 surface.

Proper continued fractions are generalized continued fractions with positive
integer numerators $a_i$ and integer denominators with $b_i\geq a_i$. In this
paper we study the strength of approximation of irrational numbers to their
convergents and classify which pairs of integers $p,q$ yield a convergent $p/q$
to some irrational $x$. Notably, we reduce the problem to finding convergence
only of index one and two. We completely classify the possible choices for
convergents of odd index and provide a near-complete classification for even
index. We furthermore propose a natural two-dimensional generalization of the
classical Gauss map as a method for dynamically generating all possible
expansions and establish ergodicity of this map.

We develop a motivic cohomology theory, representable in the Voevodsky's
triangulated category of motives, for smooth separated Deligne-Mumford stacks
and show that the resulting higher Chow groups are canonically isomorphic to
the higher $K$-theory of such stacks. This generalises the
Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem to the category of smooth Deligne-Mumford
stacks.

We consider the local theory of constant mean curvature surfaces that satisfy
one or two integrable boundary conditions and determine the corresponding
potentials for the generalized Weierstrass representation.

K{\"o}hler, in [1], presented a weight 1 newform on $\Gamma_0(576)$
constructed from a linear combination of weight 1 eta quotients and asked,
``What would be a suitable $L$ and representation $\rho$ such that
Deligne\text{-}Serre correspondence holds?" In this paper, we find the Galois
field extension $L$ and representation $\rho$ such that the
Deligne\text{-}Serre correspondence holds for this newform, and also study the
splitting of primes in $L$ using the coefficients $a(p)$ of the newform. We
also discuss an exotic newform on $\Gamma_0(1080)$ constructed from a linear
combination of weight 1 eta quotients, find the corresponding Galois extension
and representation, and study the splitting of primes in this extension.
Furthermore, we find all such newforms that can be constructed from a linear
combination of weight 1 eta quotients listed in [2] with $q$-expansion of the
form $q+\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}a(k)q^k$.

In this paper, we extend the central limit theorem of the occupation time of
the voter model on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ given in \cite{Cox1983} to the
sample path case for $d\geq 3$. The proof of our main result utilizes the
resolvent strategy and the Poisson flow strategy introduced in previous
literatures, where the duality relationship between the voter model and the
coalescing random walk plays the key role. For $d=2$ case, we give a conjecture
about an analogue result of our main theorem.

This paper analyzes the spatial bandwidth of line-of-sight (LoS) channels in
massive MIMO systems. For the linear large-scale antenna arrays (LSAA) of
transceivers placed in random locations in 3D space, a simple but accurate
closed-form expression is derived to characterize the spatial bandwidth.
Subsequent analysis of the LSAA's spatial bandwidth properties is also
provided, leading to the formulation of an approximate expression for the
effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) of bilateral near-field channels.
Interestingly, as proved in this work, when the transmit and receive arrays are
coplanar, with the receive array positioned perpendicular to the axis joining
the centroids of the transmit and receive arrays, the EDoF of the LoS channel
is found to be approximately maximized.

The geometric linearization of nonlinear differential equation is a robust
method for the construction of analytic solutions. The method is related to the
existence of Lie symmetries which can be used to determine point
transformations such that to write the given differential equation in a linear
form. In this study we employ another geometric approach and we utilize the
Eisenhart lift to geometric linearize the Newtonian system describing the
motion of a particle in a line under the application of an autonomous force.
Our findings reveal that for the oscillator, the Ermakov potential with or
without the oscillator term, and the Morse potential, Newton's second law can
be globally expressed in the form of that of a free particle. This study open
new directions for the geometric linearization of differential equations via
equivalent dynamical systems.

In this paper, we consider subordinate symmetric Markov processes which
correspond to non-killing Dirichlet forms enjoying heat kernel estimates on a
metric measure space with the volume doubling property. We obtain estimates of
the jump kernel of the subordinate process and establish equivalent conditions
for the jump kernel following Liu-Murugan. In particular, we clarify the scale
of the jump kernel, which is different from the diffusion type. This result is
appliable to non-subordinate processes by the transferring method, which uses
stability of Dirichlet forms.

Perturbing transition rates in a steady nonequilibrium system, e.g. modeled
by a Markov jump process, causes a change in the local currents. Their
susceptibility is usually expressed via Green-Kubo relations or their
nonequilibrium extensions. However, we may also wish to directly express the
mutual relation between currents. Such a nonperturbative interrelation was
discovered by P.E. Harunari et al. in [1] by applying algebraic graph theory
showing the mutual linearity of currents over different edges in a graph. We
give a novel and shorter derivation of that current relationship where we
express the current-current susceptibility as a difference in mean
first-passage times. It allows an extension to multiple currents, which remains
affine but the relation is not additive.

In this note, we reduce an instance of the partition problem to a dynamic lot
sizing problem in polynomial time, and show that solving the latter problem
solves the former problem. We further show that the instance of the partition
problem can be solved using polynomial number of addition, multiplication and
sort operations in input data using the reduction.

Let $q=p^m$ be a prime power, $e$ be an integer with $0\leq e\leq m-1$ and
$s=\gcd(e,m)$. In this paper, for a vector $v$ and a $q$-ary linear code $C$,
we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalent code $vC$
of $C$ and the extended code of $vC$ to be $e$-Galois self-orthogonal. From
this, we directly obtain some necessary and sufficient conditions for
(extended) generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS and EGRS) codes to be $e$-Galois
self-orthogonal. Furthermore, for all possible $e$ satisfying $0\leq e\leq
m-1$, we classify them into three cases (1) $\frac{m}{s}$ odd and $p$ even; (2)
$\frac{m}{s}$ odd and $p$ odd; (3) $\frac{m}{s}$ even, and construct several
new classes of $e$-Galois self-orthogonal maximum distance separable (MDS)
codes. It is worth noting that our $e$-Galois self-orthogonal MDS codes can
have dimensions greater than $\lfloor \frac{n+p^e-1}{p^e+1}\rfloor$, which are
not covered by previously known ones. Moreover, by propagation rules, we obtain
some new MDS codes with Galois hulls of arbitrary dimensions. As an
application, many quantum codes can be obtained from these MDS codes with
Galois hulls.

The main objective of this paper is to generalize a specific quantized
convexity structure of the generalized state space of a $C^*$-algebra and to
examine the associated extreme points. We introduce the notion of
$P$-$C^*$-convex subsets, where $P$ is any positive operator on a Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}$. These subsets are defined with in the set of all completely
positive (CP) maps from a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ into the algebra
$B(\mathcal{H})$ of bounded linear maps on $\mathcal{H}$. In particular, we
focus on certain $P$-$C^*$-convex sets, denoted by
$\mathrm{CP}^{(P)}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$, and analyze their extreme
points with respect to this new convexity structure. This generalizes the
existing notions of $C^*$-convex subsets and $C^*$-extreme points of unital
completely positive maps. We significantly extend many of the known results
regarding the $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps into the
context of $P$-$C^*$-convex sets we are considering. This includes abstract
characterization and structure of $P$-$C^*$-extreme points. Further, using
these studies, we completely characterize the $C^*$-extreme points of the
$C^*$-convex set of all contractive completely positive maps from $\mathcal{A}$
into $B(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is finite-dimensional. Additionally,
we discuss the connection between $P$-$C^*$-extreme points and linear extreme
points of these convex sets, as well as Krein-Milman type theorems.

This is the third part of our series of work devoted to the dynamics of an
epidemic model with nonlocal diffusions and free boundary. This part is
concerned with the rate of accelerated spreading for three types of kernel
functions when spreading happens. By constructing the suitable upper and lower
solutions, we get the rate of the accelerated spreading of free boundary, which
is closely related to the behavior of kernel functions near infinity. Our
results indicate that the heavier the tail of the kernel functions are, the
faster the rate of accelerated spreading is. Moreover, more accurate spreading
profiles for solution component $(u,v)$ are also obtained.

For the existing near-field multiuser communications based on hybrid
beamforming (HBF) architectures, high-quality effective channel estimation is
required to obtain the channel state information (CSI) for the design of the
digital beamformer. To simplify the system reconfiguration and eliminate the
pilot overhead required by the effective channel estimation, we considered an
analog-only beamforming (AoBF) architecture in this study. The AoBF is designed
with the aim of maximizing the sum rate, which is then transformed into a
problem, maximizing the power transmitted to the target user equipment (UE) and
meanwhile minimizing the power leaked to the other UEs. To solve this problem,
we used beam focusing and beam nulling and proposed two AoBF schemes based on
the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. First, the AoBF scheme based on
perfect CSI is proposed, with the focus on the beamforming performance and
regardless of the CSI acquisition. Then, the AoBF scheme based on imperfect CSI
is proposed, where the low-dimensional imperfect CSI is obtained by beam
sweeping based on a near-field codebook. Simulation results demonstrate that
the two AoBF schemes can approach the sum rate of the HBF schemes but
outperform HBF schemes in terms of energy efficiency (EE).

We show that analytic analogs of Brunn-Minkowski-type inequalities fail for
functional intrinsic volumes on convex functions. This is demonstrated both
through counterexamples and by connecting the problem to results of Colesanti,
Hug, and Saor\'in G\'omez. By restricting to a smaller set of admissible
functions, we then introduce a family of variational functionals and establish
Wulff-type inequalities for these quantities. In addition, we derive
inequalities for the corresponding family of mixed functionals, thereby
generalizing an earlier Alexandrov-Fenchel-type inequality by Klartag and
recovering a special case of a recent P\'olya-Szeg\H{o}-type inequality by
Bianchi, Cianchi, and Gronchi.

In 2007, Andrews and Paule introduced the family of functions $\Delta_k(n)$,
which enumerate the number of broken $k$-diamond partitions for a fixed
positive integer $k$. In 2013, Radu and Sellers completely characterized the
parity of $\Delta_3(8n + r)$ for some $r$ and gave a conjecture on congruences
modulo powers of 2 for broken 3-diamond partitions. We use an unconventional
$U$-sequence to solve the revised conjecture proposed by Radu and Sellers.

The persistence barcode (equivalently, the persistence diagram), which can be
obtained from the interval decomposition of a persistence module, plays a
pivotal role in applications of persistent homology. For multi-parameter
persistent homology, which lacks a complete discrete invariant, and where
persistence modules are no longer always interval decomposable, many
alternative invariants have been proposed. Many of these invariants are akin to
persistence barcodes, in that they assign (possibly signed) multisets of
intervals. Furthermore, those invariants assign any interval decomposable
module to its corresponding multiset of intervals. Naturally, identifying the
relationships among invariants of this type, or ordering them by their
discriminating power, is a fundamental question. To address this, we formalize
the notion of barcoding invariants and compare their discriminating powers.
Notably, this formalization enables us to prove that all barcoding invariants
with the same basis possess equivalent discriminating power. One implication of
our result is that introducing a new barcoding invariant does not add any value
in terms of its generic discriminating power, even if the new invariant is
distinct from the existing barcoding invariants. This suggests the need for a
more flexible and adaptable comparison framework for barcoding invariants.
Along the way, we generalize several recent results on the discriminative power
of invariants for poset representations within our unified framework.

As 6G wireless networks seek to enable robust and dynamic programmable
wireless environments (PWEs), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have
emerged as a cornerstone for controlling electromagnetic wave propagation.
However, realizing the potential of RISs for demanding PWE applications depends
on precise and real-time user localization, especially in scenarios with random
receiver orientations and inherent hardware imperfections. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel optical localization framework that integrates
conventional ceiling-mounted LEDs with light-emitting reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (LeRISs). By leveraging the spatial diversity offered by
the LeRIS architecture, the framework introduces robust signal paths that
improve localization accuracy and reduce errors under varying orientations. To
this end, we derive a system of equations for received signal strength-based
localization that accounts for random receiver orientations and imposes spatial
constraints on LED placement, ensuring unique and reliable solutions. Finally,
our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves precise
beam control and high spectral efficiency even for RISs with large number of
reflecting elements, establishing our solution as scalable and adaptive for
PWEs that require real-time accuracy and flexibility.

Let $p$ be a prime number and $q$ a power of $p$. Let $\fq$ be the finite
field with $q$ elements. For a positive integer $n$ and a polynomial
$\varphi(X)\in\fq[X]$, let $d_{n,\varphi}(X)$ denote the denominator of the
$n$th iterate of $\frac{1}{\varphi(X)}$. The polynomial $\varphi(X)$ is said to
be inversely stable over $\fq$ if all polynomials $d_{n,\varphi}(X)$ are
irreducible polynomial over $\fq$ and distinct. In this paper, we characterize
a class of inversely stable polynomials over $\fq$. Actually, for
$\varphi(X)=X^p-X+\xi\in\fq[X]$, we provide a sufficient and necessary
condition for $\varphi(X)$ to be inversely stable over $\fq$.

Causal systems often exhibit variations of the underlying causal mechanisms
between the variables of the system. Often, these changes are driven by
different environments or internal states in which the system operates, and we
refer to context variables as those variables that indicate this change in
causal mechanisms. An example are the causal relations in soil
moisture-temperature interactions and their dependence on soil moisture
regimes: Dry soil triggers a dependence of soil moisture on latent heat, while
environments with wet soil do not feature such a feedback, making it a
context-specific property. Crucially, a regime or context variable such as soil
moisture need not be exogenous and can be influenced by the dynamical system
variables - precipitation can make a dry soil wet - leading to joint systems
with endogenous context variables. In this work we investigate the assumptions
for constraint-based causal discovery of context-specific information in
systems with endogenous context variables. We show that naive approaches such
as learning different regime graphs on masked data, or pooling all data, can
lead to uninformative results. We propose an adaptive constraint-based
discovery algorithm and give a detailed discussion on the connection to
structural causal models, including sufficiency assumptions, which allow to
prove the soundness of our algorithm and to interpret the results causally.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed method over
alternative baselines, but they also unveil current limitations of our method.

We present a matrix-free parallel scalable multilevel deflation
preconditioned method for heterogeneous time-harmonic wave problems. Building
on the higher-order deflation preconditioning proposed by Dwarka and Vuik (SIAM
J. Sci. Comput. 42(2):A901-A928, 2020; J. Comput. Phys. 469:111327, 2022) for
highly indefinite time-harmonic waves, we adapt these techniques for parallel
implementation in the context of solving large-scale heterogeneous problems
with minimal pollution error. Our proposed method integrates the Complex
Shifted Laplacian preconditioner with deflation approaches. We employ
higher-order deflation vectors and re-discretization schemes derived from the
Galerkin coarsening approach for a matrix-free parallel implementation. We
suggest a robust and efficient configuration of the matrix-free multilevel
deflation method, which yields a close to wavenumber-independent convergence
and good time efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach for increasingly complex model problems. The matrix-free
implementation of the preconditioned Krylov subspace methods reduces memory
consumption, and the parallel framework exhibits satisfactory parallel
performance and weak parallel scalability. This work represents a significant
step towards developing efficient, scalable, and parallel multilevel deflation
preconditioning methods for large-scale real-world applications in wave
propagation.

We give a sufficient condition for H\"older continuity at a boundary point
for quasiminima of double-phase functionals of $p,q$-Laplace type, in the
setting of metric measure spaces equipped with a doubling measure and
supporting a Poincar\'e inequality. We use a variational approach based on De
Giorgi-type conditions to give a pointwise estimate near a boundary point. The
proofs are based on a careful phase analysis and estimates in the intrinsic
geometries.

In this paper power saving bounds for general Kloosterman sums for all Weyl
elements for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ for $n>2$ are proven, improving the trivial bound
by D\k{a}browski and Reeder. This is achieved by representing the sums in an
explicit way as exponential sums and bounding these through applications of the
Weil bound.

Aim of the paper is to study non-local dynamic boundary conditions of
reactive-diffusive type for the Laplace equation from analytic and
probabilistic point of view. In particular, we provide compact and
probabilistic representation of the solution together with an interpretation in
term of boundary processes.

Many fundamental problems in extremal combinatorics are equivalent to proving
certain polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. In 2011, a
breakthrough result by Hatami and Norine showed that it is undecidable to
verify polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. Recently,
Blekherman, Raymond and Wei extended this result by showing that it is also
undecidable to determine the validity of polynomial inequalities in
homomorphism densities for weighted graphs with edge weights taking real
values. These two results resolved a question of Lov\'asz. In this paper, we
consider the problem of determining the validity of polynomial inequalities in
digraph homomorphism densities for tournaments. We prove that the answer to
this problem is also undecidable.

The Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) involves reconstructing a hidden set
from its multiple subset sums. Initially introduced as a cryptographic problem
of accelerating the key generation process in some public key cryptosystems, it
has recently found applications in artificial intelligence privacy-preserving
research. Although the existing algorithms based on the orthogonal lattice
attack perform well in certain cryptographic applications, they are not
effective for addressing all instances of HSSP. In this work, we focus on
designing deterministic algorithms for a special case of HSSP: For a hidden
multiset $X=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}$ with elements in $\mathbb{R}$ and an integer
$k\in(1,n)$, given the multiset $X_{n,k}$ consisting of all $k$-subset sum of
$X$, the goal is to recover $X$. Such a problem is called the $(n,k)$-complete
HSSP. Two kinds of deterministic algorithms will be proposed in this work. The
first one is a brute-force search approach. In the second one, we recover $X$
by finding all the roots of the $n$-th degree polynomial whose roots are
exactly the elements of $X$. We show that the coefficients of such a polynomial
can be calculated from $X_{n,k}$. In addition, discussions pertaining to the
Stirling partition number and the ring of homogeneous symmetric polynomials are
of independent interest.

In this paper we construct two new infinite families of divisible design
graphs based on symplectic graphs over rings with precisely three ideals.

A Cheeger-Simons triangulation $(K, K')$ of a compact smooth oriented
Riemannian manifold $M$ gives rise to a Cheeger-Simons model, which defines a
finite dimensional differential character group
$\mbox{Diff}^{\bullet}(\mathscr{CS}(K, K'))$. This group converges to the
ordinary Cheeger-Simons differential character group
$\widehat{H}^{\bullet}(M)$. We introduce a simplicial higher abelian gauge
theory based on Cheeger-Simons models and demonstrate that, as the mesh
approaches zero, the partition function of this theory converges to the one
proposed by Kelnhofer in \cite{K2}.

In 2011, Barot and Marsh provided an explicit construction of presentation of
a finite Weyl group $W$ by any quiver mutation-equivalent to an orientation of
a Dynkin diagram with Weyl group $W$. The construction was extended by the
authors of the present paper to obtain presentations for all affine Coxeter
groups, as well as to construct groups from triangulations of unpunctured
surfaces and orbifolds, where the groups are invariant under change of
triangulation and thus are presented as quotients of numerous distinct Coxeter
groups. We extend the construction to include most punctured surfaces and
orbifolds, providing a new invariant for almost all marked surfaces.

For a $C^{r}$ $(r>1)$ diffeomorphism on a compact manifold that admits a
dominated splitting, this paper establishes the upper semi-continuity of the
entropy map. More precisely, given a sequence of invariant measures with only
positive Lyapunov exponents along a sub-bundle and non-positive Lyapunov
exponents along another sub-bundle, the upper limit of their metric entropies
is less than or equal to the entropy of the limiting measure.

The classification of maximal function fields over a finite field is a
difficult open problem, and even determining isomorphism classes among known
function fields is challenging in general. We study a particular family of
maximal function fields defined over a finite field with $q^2$ elements, where
$q$ is the power of an odd prime. When $d := (q+1)/2$ is a prime, this family
is known to contain a large number of non-isomorphic function fields of the
same genus and with the same automorphism group. We compute the automorphism
group and isomorphism classes also in the case where $d$ is not a prime.

This article intends to characterize triangular norms on a finite lattice. We
first give a method for generating a triangular norm on an atomistic lattice by
the values of atoms. Then we prove that every triangular norm on a non-Boolean
atomistic lattice is not left-continuous and $T_M$ is the uniquely
left-continuous triangular norm on an atomistic Boolean lattice. Furthermore,
we show that each atomistic Boolean lattice can be represented by a family of
triangular norms on an atomistic lattice with the same number of atoms.
Finally, we construct a triangular norm on a finite lattice by restricting a
triangular norm on an extended atomistic lattice of the finite lattice to the
finite lattice.

We prove a coisotropice embedding theorem \`a l\`a Gotay for
pre-multisymplectic manifolds

We show that for every g greater or equal than 5, the locus of Prym varieties
in the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g-1
that possess a pseudoreflection of geometric origin is the union of three
different non-empty explicit irreducible families. This is in stark contrast to
the loci of Jacobian varieties that possess a pseudoreflection of geometric
origin, which is empty for any genus greater than 3. In g=6, a distinguished
example of Prym varieties with a pseudoreflection is given by intermediate
Jacobians of cubic threefolds that possess an Eckardt point.

Different hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have recently been developed as
a near-term way to solve linear systems of equations on quantum devices.
However, the focus has so far been mostly on the methods, rather than the
problems that they need to tackle. In fact, these algorithms have been run on
real hardware only for problems in quantum physics, such as Hamiltonians of a
few qubits systems. These problems are particularly favorable for quantum
hardware, since their matrices are the sum of just a few unitary terms and
since only shallow quantum circuits are required to estimate the cost function.
However, for many interesting problems in linear algebra, it appears far less
trivial to find an efficient decomposition and to trade it off with the depth
of the cost quantum circuits. A first simple yet interesting instance to
consider are tridiagonal systems of equations. These arise, for instance, in
the discretization of one-dimensional finite element analyses.
  This work presents a method to solve a class of tridiagonal systems of
equations with the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), a recently
proposed variational hybrid algorithm for solving linear systems. In
particular, we present a new decomposition for this class of matrices based on
both Pauli strings and multi--qubit gates, resulting in less terms than those
obtained by just using Pauli gates. Based on this decomposition, we discuss the
tradeoff between the number of terms and the near-term implementability of the
quantum circuits. Furthermore, we present the first simulated and real-hardware
results obtained by solving tridiagonal linear systems with VQLS, using the
decomposition proposed.

The Harer-Zagier (HZ) transform maps the HOMFLY-PT polynomial into a rational
function. For some special knots and links, the latter has a simple factorised
form, both in the numerator and denominator. This property seems to be
preserved under full twists and concatenation with the Jucys--Murphy's braid,
which are hence used to generate infinite families with HZ factorisability. For
such families, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial can be fully encoded in two sets of
integers, corresponding to the numerator and denominator exponents. These
exponents turn out to be related to the Khovanov homology and its Euler
characteristics. A criterion for when factorisability occurs is found via a
conjectural relation between the HOMFLY-PT and Kauffman polynomials, which is
proven in several special cases. The latter is equivalent to the vanishing of
the two-crosscap BPS invariant of topological strings.

A new family of groups, called trickle groups, is presented. These groups
generalize right-angled Artin and Coxeter groups, as well as cactus groups. A
trickle group is defined by a presentation with relations of the form $xy = zx$
and $x^\mu = 1$, that are governed by a simplicial graph, called a trickle
graph, endowed with a partial ordering on the vertices, a vertex labeling, and
an automorphism of the star of each vertex. We show several examples of trickle
groups, including extended cactus groups, certain finite-index subgroups of
virtual cactus groups, Thompson group F, and ordered quandle groups. A
terminating and confluent rewriting system is established for trickle groups,
enabling the definition of normal forms and a solution to the word problem. An
alternative solution to the word problem is also presented, offering a simpler
formulation akin to Tits' approach for Coxeter groups and Green's for graph
products of cyclic groups. A natural notion of a parabolic subgraph of a
trickle graph is introduced. The subgroup generated by the vertices of such a
subgraph is called a standard parabolic subgroup and it is shown to be the
trickle group associated with the subgraph itself. The intersection of two
standard parabolic subgroups is also proven to be a standard parabolic
subgroup. If only relations of the form $xy = zx$ are retained in the
definition of a trickle group, then the resulting group is called a preGarside
trickle group. Such a group is proved to be a preGarside group, a torsion-free
group, and a Garside group if and only if its associated trickle graph is
finite and complete.

Many articles have recently been devoted to Mahler equations, partly because
of their links with other branches of mathematics such as automata theory. Hahn
series (a generalization of the Puiseux series allowing arbitrary exponents of
the indeterminate as long as the set that supports them is well-ordered) play a
central role in the theory of Mahler equations. In this paper, we address the
following fundamental question: is there an algorithm to calculate the Hahn
series solutions of a given linear Mahler equation? What makes this question
interesting is the fact that the Hahn series appearing in this context can have
complicated supports with infinitely many accumulation points. Our (positive)
answer to the above question involves among other things the construction of a
computable well-ordered receptacle for the supports of the potential Hahn
series solutions.

In this proceedings article we survey the results in [5] and their
motivation, as presented at the 50th Journ\'ees EDP 2024. With the aim of
quantifying turbulent behaviors of vortex filaments, we study the
multifractality of a family of generalized Riemann's non-differentiable
functions. These functions represent, in a certain limit, the trajectory of
regular polygonal vortex filaments that evolve according to the binormal flow,
the classical model for vortex filaments dynamics. We explain how we determined
their spectrum of singularities through a careful design of Diophantine sets,
which we study by using the Duffin-Schaeffer theorem and the Mass Transference
Principle.

One-dimensional Poincare inequalities are used in Global Sensitivity Analysis
(GSA) to provide derivative-based upper bounds and approximations of Sobol
indices. We add new perspectives by investigating weighted Poincare
inequalities. Our contributions are twofold. In a first part, we provide new
theoretical results for weighted Poincare inequalities, guided by GSA needs. We
revisit the construction of weights from monotonic functions, providing a new
proof from a spectral point of view. In this approach, given a monotonic
function g, the weight is built such that g is the first non-trivial
eigenfunction of a convenient diffusion operator. This allows us to reconsider
the linear standard, i.e. the weight associated to a linear g. In particular,
we construct weights that guarantee the existence of an orthonormal basis of
eigenfunctions, leading to approximation of Sobol indices with Parseval
formulas. In a second part, we develop specific methods for GSA. We study the
equality case of the upper bound of a total Sobol index, and link the sharpness
of the inequality to the proximity of the main effect to the eigenfunction.
This leads us to theoretically investigate the construction of data-driven
weights from estimators of the main effects when they are monotonic, another
extension of the linear standard. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of using
weights on a GSA study of two toy models and a real flooding application,
involving the Poincare constant and/or the whole eigenbasis.

In this note we give a criterion for the existence of a fractional-linear
integral for a geodesic flow on a Riemannian surface and explain that modulo
M\"obius transformations the moduli space of such local integrals (if nonempty)
is either the two-dimensional projective plane or a finite number of points. We
will also consider explicit examples and discuss a relation of such rational
integrals to Killing vectors.

In this article, we shall describe the center of the universal affine vertex
superalgebra $V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak g)$ associated with $\mathfrak
g=\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}, \mathfrak {gl}_{2|1}$ at the critical level $\kappa_c$
and prove the conjecture of A. Molev and E. Ragoucy in this case.
  The center $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ turns out to be
isomorphic to the large level limit $\ell \rightarrow \infty$ of a vertex
subalgebra, called the parafermion vertex algebra $K^{\ell} (\mathfrak{sl}_2)$,
of the affine vertex algebra $V^\ell(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. The key ingredient of
the proof is to understand the principal $W$-superalgebra $
W^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1})$ at the critical level. It relates the center
$\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl} _{2|1}))$ to
$V^\infty(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ via the Kazama-Suzuki duality while it has a
surprising coincidence with $V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1})$, whose center
has been recently described. Moreover, the centers
$\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ and
$\mathfrak{z}(W^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ are proven to coincide as a
byproduct.
  A general conjecture is proposed which describes the center
$\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{n|m}))$ with $n>m$ as a large level
limit of ``the dual side'', i.e., the parafermion-type subalgebras of
$W$-algebras $ W^\ell(\mathfrak{sl}_{n}, \mathbb{O}_{[n-m,1^m]})$ associated
with hook-type partitions $[n-m,1^m]$, known also as vertex algebras at the
corner.

Conformal geodesics form an invariantly defined family of unparametrized
curves in a conformal manifold generalizing unparametrized geodesics/paths of
projective connections. The equation describing them is of third order, and it
was an open problem whether they are given by an Euler--Lagrange equation. In
dimension 3 (the simplest, but most important from the viewpoint of physical
applications) we demonstrate that the equation for unparametrized conformal
geodesics is variational.

The Generalized Persistence Diagram (GPD) for multi-parameter persistence
naturally extends the classical notion of persistence diagram for one-parameter
persistence. However, unlike its classical counterpart, computing the GPD
remains a significant challenge. The main hurdle is that, while the GPD is
defined as the M\"obius inversion of the Generalized Rank Invariant (GRI),
computing the GRI is intractable due to the formidable size of its domain,
i.e., the set of all connected and convex subsets in a finite grid in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. This computational intractability suggests
seeking alternative approaches to computing the GPD.
  In order to study the complexity associated to computing the GPD, it is
useful to consider its classical one-parameter counterpart, where for a
filtration of a simplicial complex with $n$ simplices, its persistence diagram
contains at most $n$ points. This observation leads to the question: 'Given a
$d$-parameter simplicial filtration, could the cardinality of its GPD
(specifically, the support of the GPD) also be bounded by a polynomial in the
number of simplices in the filtration?' This is the case for $d=1$, where we
compute the persistence diagram directly at the simplicial filtration level. If
this were also the case for $d\geq2$, it might be possible to compute the GPD
directly and much more efficiently without relying on the GRI.
  We show that the answer to the question above is negative, demonstrating the
inherent difficulty of computing the GPD. More specifically, we construct a
sequence of $d$-parameter simplicial filtrations where the cardinalities of
their GPDs are not bounded by any polynomial in the the number of simplices.
Furthermore, we show that several commonly used methods for constructing
multi-parameter filtrations can give rise to such "wild" filtrations.

The fluid antenna (FA)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system
based on index modulation (IM), referred to as FA-IM, significantly enhances
spectral efficiency (SE) compared to the conventional FA-assisted MIMO system.
This paper proposes an innovative FA grouping-based IM (FAG-IM) system to
improve performance in mitigating the high spatial correlation between multiple
activated ports. A block grouping scheme is employed based on the spatial
correlation model and the distribution structure of the ports. Then, a
closed-form expression for the average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound
of the FAG-IM system is derived. In order to reduce the receiver complexity of
the proposed system, the message passing mechanism is first incorporated into
the FAG-IM system. Subsequently, within the approximate message passing (AMP)
framework, an efficient structured AMP (S-AMP) detector is devised by
leveraging the structural characteristics of the transmission signal vector.
Simulation results confirm that the proposed FAG-IM system significantly
outperforms the existing FA-IM system in the presence of spatial correlation.
The derived ABEP curve aligns well with the numerical results, providing an
efficient theoretical tool for evaluating the system performance. Additionally,
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed low-complexity S-AMP detector
not only reduces the time complexity to a linear scale but also substantially
improves bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the minimum mean square
error (MMSE) detector, thus facilitating the practical implementation of the
FAG-IM system.

The sixth generation (6G) industrial Sub-networks (SNs) face several
challenges in meeting extreme latency and reliability requirements in the order
of 0.1-1 ms and 99.999 -to-99.99999 percentile, respectively. Interference
management (IM) plays an integral role in addressing these requirements,
especially in ultra-dense SN environments with rapidly varying interference
induced by channel characteristics, mobility, and resource limitations. In
general, IM can be achieved using resource allocation and \textit{accurate}
Link adaptation (LA). In this work, we focus on the latter, where we first
model interference at SN devices using the spatially consistent 3GPP channel
model. Following this, we present a discrete-time dynamic state space model
(DSSM) at a SN access point (AP), where interference power values (IPVs) are
modeled as latent variables incorporating underlying modeling errors as well as
transmission/protocol delays. Necessary approximations are then presented to
simplify the DSSM and to efficiently employ the extended Kalman filter (EKF)
for interference prediction. Unlike baseline methods, our proposed approach
predicts IPVs solely based on the channel quality indicator (CQI) reports
available at the SN AP at every transmission time interval (TTI). Numerical
results demonstrate that our proposed approach clearly outperforms the
conventional baseline. Furthermore, we also show that despite predicting with
limited information, our proposed approach consistently achieves a comparable
performance w.r.t the off-the-shelf supervised learning based baseline.

In this paper, we study the existence of a dense orbit for the diagonal
$\PGL(n)$ action on self-products of partial flag varieties. We determine when
there exists a dense orbit for flag varieties of the form $F(k_1, \dots, k_r;
n)^m$ when $k_i = i$ or when $m=3$ and $k_i = \ell + i$ for some $\ell \geq 0$.
We also show that certain infinite families of products do not have a dense
orbit.

In this letter, we propose a new conformal array architecture, called
extremely large-scale uniform arc array (XL-UAA), to improve near-field
communication performance. Specifically,under the non-uniform spherical
wavefront channel model, we establish mathematical modeling and performance
analysis for XL-UAAs. It is shown that XL-UAAs have larger direction-dependent
Rayleigh distance and uniform power distance than the conventional XL uniform
linear arrays (XL-ULAs). Moreover, a closed-form expression for the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is obtained, which depends on collective properties
of XL-UAAs, such as the distance between the user and the array center,as well
as the arc radius. In addition, we show that the asymptotic SNR of XL-UAAs with
the number of antennas depends on the projection distance of the user to the
middle of the arc array. Finally, numerical results verify that XL-UAAs achieve
a higher SNR than XL-ULAs, especially at larger user incident angles.

We present a library of formalized results around symmetric functions and the
character theory of symmetric groups. Written in Coq/Rocq and based on the
Mathematical Components library, it covers a large part of the contents of a
graduate level textbook in the field. The flagship result is a proof of the
Littlewood-Richardson rule, which computes the structure constants of the
algebra of symmetric function in the schur basis which are integer numbers
appearing in various fields of mathematics, and which has a long history of
wrong proofs. A specific feature of algebraic combinatorics is the constant
interplay between algorithms and algebraic constructions: algorithms are not
only in computations, but also are key ingredients in definitions and proofs.
As such, the proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule deeply relies on the
understanding of the execution of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm. Many
results in this library are effective and actually used in computer algebra
systems, and we discuss their certified implementation.

Entanglement of bipartite squeezed states generated by holomorphic Hermite
functions of two complex variables is investigated using phase-space approach
based on the Wigner distribution function. Orthogonality of the holomorphic
Hermite functions implies the relationship between certain real parameter
associated with the non-rotational measure in the Bargmann space and the
squeezing parameter. The mutual relation between squeezing and entanglement is
elucidated with the help of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose
criterion formulated in the phase-space version for continuous-variable
systems. The quantitative characteristics of the entanglement is determined
using the log-negativity criterion. The oscillator-like model of a two-particle
quantum-mechanical system is developed to illustrate the presented findings.

This paper presents enhanced reductions of the bounded-weight and
exact-weight Syndrome Decoding Problem (SDP) to a system of quadratic
equations. Over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we improve on a previous work and study the
degree of regularity of the modeling of the exact weight SDP. Additionally, we
introduce a novel technique that transforms SDP instances over $\mathbb{F}_q$
into systems of polynomial equations and thoroughly investigate the dimension
of their varieties. Experimental results are provided to evaluate the
complexity of solving SDP instances using our models through Gr\"obner bases
techniques.

Hypersequent calculus G{\L}$\forall$ for first-order {\L}ukasiewicz logic was
first introduced by Baaz and Metcalfe, along with a proof of its approximate
completeness with respect to standard $[0,1]$-semantics. The completeness
result was later pointed out by Gerasimov that it only applies to prenex
formulas. In this paper, we will present our proof of approximate completeness
of G{\L}$\forall$ for arbitrary first-order formulas by generalizing the
original completeness proof to hypersequents.

In the paper we investigate the joint spectra of Banach space representations
of the quantum q-plane called Banach q-modules. Based on the transversality
relation from the topological homology of the trivial modules versus given a
left Banach q-module, we introduce the joint (essential) spectra of a Banach
q-module. In particular, we have the well defined Taylor joint spectrum of a
Banach q-module. The noncommutative projection q-property is proved for the
Taylor spectrum, which stands out the conventional projection property in the
commutative case. It is provided the key examples of the Banach q-modules,
which do not possesses nether forward nor backward projection properties.

In the paper we investigate the Banach space representations of Manin's
quantum q-plane for |q| is not 1. The Arens-Michael envelope of the quantum
plane is extended up to a Frechet algebra presheaf over its spectrum. The
obtained ringed space represents the geometry of the quantum plane as a union
of two irreducible components being copies of the complex plane equipped with
the q-topology and the disk topology, respectively. It turns out that the
Frechet algebra presheaf is commutative modulo its Jacobson radical, which is
decomposed into a topological direct sum. The related noncommutative functional
calculus problem and the spectral mapping property are solved in terms of the
noncommutative Harte spectrum.

We introduce and study a class of starlike functions associated with the
non-convex domain \[ \mathcal{S}^*_{nc} = \left\{ f \in \mathcal{A} : \frac{z
f'(z)}{f(z)} \prec \frac{1+z}{\cos{z}} =: \varphi_{nc}(z), \;\; z \in
\mathbb{D} \right\}. \] Key results include the growth and distortion theorems,
initial coefficient bounds, and the sharp estimates for third-order Hankel and
Hermitian-Toeplitz determinants. We also examine inclusion relations, radius
problems for certain subclasses, and subordination results.
  These findings enrich the theory of starlike functions associated with
non-convex domains, offering new perspectives in geometric function theory.

In the present paper, we give the classification of a subclass of
n-dimensional naturally graded associative algebras with nilindex $n-3$. The
subclass has the characteristic sequence $C(\mathcal{A})=(n-3,2,1)$. The result
completes the classification of naturally graded associative algebras with
nilindex $n-3$ for $n>6$.

We consider time periodic Hamiltonian on periodic graphs and estimate the
number of its quasi-energy eigenvalues on the finite interval.

In this paper, we study the concepts of normal functions and $\varphi$-normal
functions in the framework of planar harmonic mappings. We establish the
harmonic mapping counterpart of the well-known Zalcman-Pang lemma and as a
consequence, we prove that a harmonic mapping whose spherical derivative is
bounded away from zero is normal. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the
extended spherical derivative for harmonic mappings and obtain several
sufficient conditions for a harmonic mapping to be $\varphi$-normal.

Let $q$ be a Pisot or Salem number. Let $f_j(x)$ $(j=1,2,\dots)$ be
integer-valued polynomials of degree $\ge2$ with positive leading coefficients,
and let $\{a_j (n)\}_{n\ge1}$ $(j=1,2,\dots)$ be sequences of algebraic
integers in the field $\mathbb{Q}(q)$ with suitable growth conditions. In this
paper, we investigate linear independence over $\mathbb{Q}(q)$ of the numbers
\begin{equation*} 1,\qquad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_j (n)}{q^{f_j (n)}}
\quad (j=1,2,\dots). \end{equation*} In particular, when $a_j(n)$
$(j=1,2,\dots)$ are polynomials of $n$, we give a linear independence criterion
for the above numbers.

This paper is concerned with the minimum-time path-planning problem for a
Dubins airplane under the influence of steady wind. The path-planning problem,
by transforming into the air-relative frame, is equivalent to finding the
minimum-time control strategy for a Dubins airplane to intercept a moving
target. In the air-relative frame, by applying Pontryagin's maximum principle,
the candidates for the minimum-time solution are categorized into a family of
four types: SC, CC, CCC, CSC, where S denotes a straight line segment and C
denotes a circular segment. Furthermore, the geometric properties for each type
are analyzed, indicating that the paths of SC and CC can be obtained by finding
the roots of a quadratic equation, while the paths of CCC and CSC are
determined by the roots of some nonlinear transcendental equations. An improved
bisection method is presented in the paper so that all the roots of the
transcendental equations can be computed within a constant time. As a
consequence, the globally optimal path can be obtained within a constant time
by comparing all the candidates of the four types. Finally, numerical examples
are presented, showing that the closed-form solutions derived in the paper can
ensure to find the globally optimal solution by comparing with existing methods
in the literature.

For lengths $36$, $48$ and $60$, we construct new ternary near-extremal
self-dual codes with weight enumerators for which no ternary near-extremal
self-dual codes were previously known to exist.

Given a smooth and bounded domain $\Omega(\subset\mathbf{R}^N)$, we prove the
existence of two non-trivial, non-negative solutions for the semilinear
degenerate elliptic equation \begin{align} \left. \begin{array}{l}
-\Delta_\lambda u=\mu g(z)|u|^{r-1}u+h(z)|u|^{s-1}u \;\text{in}\; \Omega u\in
H^{1,\lambda}_0(\Omega) \end{array}\right\} \end{align} where
$\Delta_\lambda=\Delta_x+|x|^{2\lambda}\Delta_y$ is the Grushin Laplacian
Operator, $z=(x,y)\in\Omega$, $N=n+m;\, n,\, m\geq 1$, $\lambda>0$, $0\leq
r<1<s<2^*_\lambda-1$; the functions $g,h$ are of indefinite sign and
$2^*_\lambda=\frac{2Q}{Q-2}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent, where
$Q=n+(1+\lambda)m$ is the homogeneous dimension associated to the operator
$\Delta_\lambda$. As for the critical case $s=2^*_\lambda-1$, we prove the
existence of at least two non-trivial, non-negative solutions provided $g\geq
0$ and $h\equiv 1$.

We show that the space of Bridgeland stability conditions equipped with the
canonical metric is, in general, not a length space, thereby providing a
negative answer to a question posed by Kikuta.

We present a framework to classify PL-types of large censuses of triangulated
$4$-manifolds, which we use to classify the PL-types of all triangulated
$4$-manifolds with up to $6$ pentachora. This is successful except for
triangulations homeomorphic to the $4$-sphere, $\mathbb{C}P^2$, and the
rational homology sphere $QS^4(2)$, where we find at most four, three, and two
PL-types respectively. We conjecture that they are all standard. In addition,
we look at the cases resisting classification and discuss the combinatorial
structure of these triangulations -- which we deem interesting in their own
rights.

We study the Izergin-Korepin Gaudin models with both periodic and open
integrable boundary conditions, which describe novel quantum systems exhibiting
long-range interactions. Using the Bethe ansatz approach, we derive the
eigenvalues of the Gaudin operators and the corresponding Bethe ansatz
equations.

Understanding the latent spaces learned by deep learning models is crucial in
exploring how they represent and generate complex data. Autoencoders (AEs) have
played a key role in the area of representation learning, with numerous
regularization techniques and training principles developed not only to enhance
their ability to learn compact and robust representations, but also to reveal
how different architectures influence the structure and smoothness of the
lower-dimensional non-linear manifold. We strive to characterize the structure
of the latent spaces learned by different autoencoders including convolutional
autoencoders (CAEs), denoising autoencoders (DAEs), and variational
autoencoders (VAEs) and how they change with the perturbations in the input. By
characterizing the matrix manifolds corresponding to the latent spaces, we
provide an explanation for the well-known observation that the latent spaces of
CAE and DAE form non-smooth manifolds, while that of VAE forms a smooth
manifold. We also map the points of the matrix manifold to a Hilbert space
using distance preserving transforms and provide an alternate view in terms of
the subspaces generated in the Hilbert space as a function of the distortion in
the input. The results show that the latent manifolds of CAE and DAE are
stratified with each stratum being a smooth product manifold, while the
manifold of VAE is a smooth product manifold of two symmetric positive definite
matrices and a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix.

Ferromagnetic magnetohydrodynamics concerns the study of conducting fluids
with intrinsic magnetisation under the influence of a magnetic field. It is a
generalisation of the magnetohydrodynamical equations and takes into account
the dynamics of the magnetisation of a fluid. First proposed by Lingam (Lingam,
`Dissipative effects in magnetohydrodynamical models with intrinsic
magnetisation', Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation
Vol 28, pp 223-231, 2015), the usual equations of magnetohydrodynamics, namely
the Navier-Stokes equation and the induction equation, are coupled with the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In this paper, the local existence,
uniqueness and regularity of weak solutions to this system are discussed.

Prelle and Singer showed in 1983 that if a system of ordinary differential
equations defined on a differential field $K$ has a first integral in an
elementrary field extension $L$ of $K$, then it must have a first integral
consisting of algebraic elements over $K$ via their constant powers and
logarithms. Based on this result they further proved that an elementary
integrable planar polynomial differential system has an integrating factor
which is a fractional power of a rational function. Here we extend their
results and prove that any $n$ dimensional elementary integrable polynomial
vector field has $n-1$ functionally independent first integrals being composed
of algebraic elements over $K$. Furthermore, using the Galois theory we prove
that the vector field has a rational Jacobian multiplier.

In this paper, we study compactness and finiteness of an $\infty$-category
$\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a conservative functor to a finite poset $P$. We
provide sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ to be compact in terms of
strata and homotopy links of $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow P$. Analogous conditions
for $\mathcal{C}$ to be finite are also given. From these, we deduce that, if
$X\rightarrow P$ is a conically stratified space with the property that the
weak homotopy type of its strata, and of strata of its local links, are compact
(respectively finite) $\infty$-groupoids, then $\text{Exit}_P(X)$ is compact
(respectively finite). This gives a positive answer to a question of Porta and
Teyssier. If $X\rightarrow P$ is equipped with a conically smooth structure
(e.g. a Whitney stratification), we show that $\text{Exit}_P(X)$ is finite if
and only the weak homotopy types of the strata of $X\rightarrow P$ are finite.
The aforementioned characterization relies on the finiteness of
$\text{Exit}_P(X)$, when $X\rightarrow P$ is compact and conically smooth. We
conclude our paper by showing that the analogous statement does not hold in the
topological category. More explicitly, we provide an example of a compact
$C^0$-stratified space whose exit paths $\infty$-category is compact, but not
finite. This stratified space was constructed by Quinn. We also observe that
this provides a non-trivial example of a $C^0$-stratified space which does not
admit any conically smooth structure.

In the present paper, we study the first eigenvalue $\lambda(p)$ of the
one-dimensional $p$-Laplacian in the interval $(-1,1)$. We give an upper and
lower estimate of $\lambda(p)$ and study its asymptotic behavior as $p \to 1+0$
or $p \to \infty$.

In the advent of next-generation wireless communication, millimeter-wave
(mmWave) and terahertz (THz) technologies are pivotal for their high data rate
capabilities. However, their reliance on large antenna arrays and narrow
directive beams for ensuring adequate receive signal power introduces
significant beam training overheads. This becomes particularly challenging in
supporting highly-mobile applications such as drone communication, where the
dynamic nature of drones demands frequent beam alignment to maintain
connectivity. Addressing this critical bottleneck, our paper introduces a novel
machine learning-based framework that leverages multi-modal sensory data,
including visual and positional information, to expedite and refine mmWave/THz
beam prediction. Unlike conventional approaches that solely depend on
exhaustive beam training methods, our solution incorporates additional layers
of contextual data to accurately predict beam directions, significantly
mitigating the training overhead. Additionally, our framework is capable of
predicting future beam alignments ahead of time. This feature enhances the
system's responsiveness and reliability by addressing the challenges posed by
the drones' mobility and the computational delays encountered in real-time
processing. This capability for advanced beam tracking asserts a critical
advancement in maintaining seamless connectivity for highly-mobile drones. We
validate our approach through comprehensive evaluations on a unique, real-world
mmWave drone communication dataset, which integrates concurrent camera visuals,
practical GPS coordinates, and mmWave beam training data...

Lagrangian tracer particle trajectories for invariant solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations confined to the three-dimensional geometry of plane
Couette flow are studied. Treating the Eulerian velocity field of an invariant
solution as a dynamical system, the transport of these passive scalars along
Lagrangian flow trajectories reveals a rich repertoire of different types of
motion that can occur, including stagnation points, for which there is no fluid
movement, and invariant tori, which obstruct chaotic mixing across the full
volume of the plane Couette flow minimal cell. We determine the stability of
these stagnation points, along with their stable and unstable manifolds, and
find heteroclinic connections between them. These topological features produce
a skeleton that shapes the passive tracer flow for a turbulent fluid, providing
a first step to elucidating Lagrangian particle transport and mixing in
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulent flows.

Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising solution for enhancing
wireless network capacity through the adjustment of both three-dimensional (3D)
positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces. Previous works
mainly consider 6DMA surfaces composed of active antenna elements, thus termed
as active 6DMA. In this letter, we propose a new passive 6DMA system consisting
of distributed passive intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) that can be
adjusted in terms of 3D position and 3D rotation. Specifically, we study a
passive 6DMA-aided multiuser uplink system and aim to maximize the users'
achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the 3D positions, 3D rotations, and
reflection coefficients of all passive 6DMA surfaces, as well as the receive
beamforming matrix at the base station (BS). To solve this challenging
non-convex optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)
algorithm that decomposes it into three subproblems and solves them alternately
in an iterative manner. Numerical results are presented to investigate the
performance of the proposed passive 6DMA system under different configurations
and demonstrate its superior performance over the traditional fixed-IRS
counterpart for both directive and isotropic radiation patterns of passive
reflecting elements.

We analyze the discrete-time dynamics of a model of non-interacting fermions
on a finite graph coupled to an infinite reservoir formed by a bosonic quantum
walk on Z. This dynamics consists of consecutive applications of free
evolutions of the fermions and bosons followed by a local coupling between
them. The unitary operator implementing this coupling generates fermionic
transitions between two fixed vertices induced by absorption and emission of
bosons at a single lattice site. The free fermion evolution is given by a
second-quantized single-particle unitary operator satisfying some genericity
assumptions, in particular it produces hopping of fermions between all
vertices. The free boson evolution is given by the second-quantized shift
operator on Z. We derive explicitly the Heisenberg dynamics of fermionic
observables and obtain a systematic expansion in the large-coupling regime,
which we control by using spectral methods. We also prove that the reduced
state of the fermions converges in the large-time limit to an
infinite-temperature Gibbs

We consider a first order operator with a periodic 3x3 matrix potential on
the real line. This operator appears in the problem of the periodic vector NLS
equation. The spectrum of the operator covers the real line, it is union of the
spectral bands of multiplicity 3, separated by spectral intervals of
multiplicity 1. The main results of this work are the following: The Lyapunov
function on the corresponding 2 or 3-sheeted Riemann surface is described.
Necessary and sufficient conditions are given when the Riemann surface is
2-sheeted. The asymptotics of 2-periodic eigenvalues are determined. One
constructs an entire function, which is positive on the spectrum of
multiplicity 3 and is negative on its gaps. The Borg type results about inverse
problems are solved.

Wigner's classification has led to the insight that projective unitary
representations play a prominent role in quantum mechanics. The physics
literature often states that the theory of projective unitary representations
can be reduced to the theory of ordinary unitary representations by enlarging
the group of physical symmetries. Nevertheless, the enlargement process is not
always described explicitly: it is unclear in which cases the enlargement has
to be done to the universal cover, a central extension, or to a central
extension of the universal cover. On the other hand, in the mathematical
literature, projective unitary representations were extensively studied, and
famous theorems such as the theorems of Bargmann and Cassinelli have been
achieved. The present article bridges the two: we provide a precise,
step-by-step guide on describing projective unitary representations as unitary
representations of the enlarged group. Particular focus is paid to the
difference between algebraic and topological obstructions. To build the bridge
mentioned above, we present a detailed review of the difference between group
cohomology and Lie group cohomology. This culminates in classifying Lie group
central extensions by smooth cocycles around the identity. Finally, the
take-away message is a hands-on algorithm that takes the symmetry group of a
given quantum theory as input and provides the enlarged group as output. This
algorithm is applied to several cases of physical interest. We also briefly
outline a generalization of Bargmann's theory to time-dependent phases using
Hilbert bundles.

The problem of sequential anomaly detection and identification is considered,
where multiple data sources are simultaneously monitored and the goal is to
identify in real time those, if any, that exhibit ``anomalous" statistical
behavior. An upper bound is postulated on the number of data sources that can
be sampled at each sampling instant, but the decision maker selects which ones
to sample based on the already collected data. Thus, in this context, a policy
consists not only of a stopping rule and a decision rule that determine when
sampling should be terminated and which sources to identify as anomalous upon
stopping, but also of a sampling rule that determines which sources to sample
at each time instant subject to the sampling constraint. Two distinct
formulations are considered, which require control of different, ``generalized"
error metrics. The first one tolerates a certain user-specified number of
errors, of any kind, whereas the second tolerates distinct, user-specified
numbers of false positives and false negatives. For each of them, a universal
asymptotic lower bound on the expected time for stopping is established as the
error probabilities go to 0, and it is shown to be attained by a policy that
combines the stopping and decision rules proposed in the full-sampling case
with a probabilistic sampling rule that achieves a specific long-run sampling
frequency for each source. Moreover, the optimal to a first order asymptotic
approximation expected time for stopping is compared in simulation studies with
the corresponding factor in a finite regime, and the impact of the sampling
constraint and tolerance to errors is assessed.

How should we model an observer within quantum mechanics or quantum field
theory? How can classical physics emerge from a quantum model, and why should
classical probability be useful? How can we model a selective measurement
entirely within a closed quantum system? This paper sketches a new physical
theory of probability based on an attempt to model classical information within
a purely quantum system. We model classical information using a version of
Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism, with emphasis on quantum information
encoded using projection operators localised in spacetime. This version of
Quantum Darwinism is compatible with quantum field theory, and does not require
any artificial division of a quantum system into subsystems. The main
innovation is our attempt to provide a physical explanation of probability.
Decoherence is the physical mechanism behind Quantum Darwinism or the
`branching of quantum worlds'. Assuming a type of perfect decoherence we
construct a conventional probabilistic model for classical information. This,
however, is not our theory of natural probability, and does not quite
demonstrate the validity of Bayesian reasoning. Instead, our theory of natural
probability arises from careful consideration of errors in decoherence: roughly
speaking, we don't observe low probability events because they are swamped by
quantum noise.

When the domain is a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative
Bakry--Emery Ricci curvature and the target is a complete Riemannian manifold
with sectional curvature bounded above by a positive constant, by carrying out
refined gradient estimates, we obtain a better Liouville theorem for ancient
solutions to the V-harmonic map heat flows. Furthermore, we can also derive a
Liouville theorem for quasi-harmonic maps under an exponential growth
condition.

We add small random perturbations to a cellular automaton and consider the
one-parameter family $(F_\epsilon)_{\epsilon>0}$ parameterized by $\epsilon$
where $\epsilon>0$ is the level of noise. The objective of the article is to
study the set of limiting invariant distributions as $\epsilon$ tends to zero
denoted $\Ml$. Some topological obstructions appear, $\Ml$ is compact and
connected, as well as combinatorial obstructions as the set of cellular
automata is countable: $\Ml$ is $\Pi_3$-computable in general and
$\Pi_2$-computable if it is uniformly approached. Reciprocally, for any set of
probability measures $\mathcal{K}$ which is compact, connected and
$\Pi_2$-computable, we construct a cellular automaton whose perturbations by an
uniform noise admit $\mathcal{K}$ as the zero-noise limits measure and this set
is uniformly approached. To finish, we study how the set of limiting invariant
measures can depend on a bias in the noise. We construct a cellular automaton
which realizes any connected compact set (without computable constraints) if
the bias is changed for an arbitrary small value. In some sense this cellular
automaton is very unstable with respect to the noise.

Integer geometry on a plane deals with objects whose vertices are points in
$\mathbb Z^2$. The congruence relation is provided by all affine
transformations preserving the lattice $\mathbb Z^2$. In this paper we study
circumscribed circles in integer geometry. We introduce the notions of integer
and rational circumscribed circles of integer sets. We determine the conditions
for a finite integer set to admit an integer circumscribed circle and describe
the spectra of radii for integer and rational circumscribed circles.

We develop Aubin--Nitsche-type estimates for recently proposed first-order
system least-squares finite element methods (FOSLS) for the heat equation.
Under certain assumptions, which are satisfied if the spatial domain is convex
and the heat source and initial datum are sufficiently smooth, we prove that
the $L^2$ error of approximations of the scalar field variable converges at a
higher rate than the overall error. Furthermore, a higher-order conservation
property is shown. In addition, we discuss quasi-optimality in weaker norms.
Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings.

In this note, we extend diameter bounds of Simon, Topping, and Wu--Zheng to
submanifolds with boundary and (potentially non-compact) ambient manifolds with
minor curvature restrictions. The bound is dependent on both an integral of
mean curvature and the area of the manifold. We apply our diameter bounds to
minimal, constant mean curvature, and prescribed mean curvature surfaces
arising in min-max constructions.

We obtain a totient analogue for Linnik's theorem in arithmetic progressions.
Specifically, for any coprime pair of positive integers $(m,a)$ such that $m$
is odd, there exists $n\le m^{2+o(1)}$ such that $\varphi(n)\equiv
a\,\mathrm{mod}\,{m}$.

We study optimal design problems where the design corresponds to a
coefficient in the principal part of the state equation. The state equation, in
addition, is parameter dependent, and we allow it to change type in the limit
of this (modeling) parameter. We develop a framework that guarantees asymptotic
compatibility, that is unconditional convergence with respect to modeling and
discretization parameters to the solution of the corresponding limiting
problems. This framework is then applied to two distinct classes of problems
where the modeling parameter represents the degree of nonlocality.
Specifically, we show unconditional convergence of optimal design problems when
the state equation is either a scalar-valued fractional equation, or a strongly
coupled system of nonlocal equations derived from the bond-based model of
peridynamics.

We consider the global minimization of a particular type of minimum
structured optimization problems wherein the variables must belong to some
basic set, the feasible domain is described by the intersection of a large
number of functional constraints and the objective stems as the pointwise
minimum of a collection of functional pieces. Among others, this setting
includes all non-convex piecewise linear problems. The global minimum of a
minimum structured problem can be computed using a simple enumeration scheme by
solving a sequence of individual problems involving each a single piece and
then taking the smallest individual minimum.
  We propose a new algorithm, called Upper-Lower Optimization (ULO), tackling
problems from the aforementioned class. Our method does not require the
solution of every individual problem listed in the baseline enumeration scheme,
yielding potential substantial computational gains. It alternates between (a)
local-search steps, which minimize upper models, and (b) suggestion steps,
which optimize lower models. We prove that ULO can return a solution of any
prescribed global optimality accuracy. According to a computational complexity
model based on the cost of solving the individual problems, we analyze in which
practical scenarios ULO is expected to outperform the baseline enumeration
scheme. Finally, we empirically validate our approach on a set of piecewise
linear programs (PL) of incremental difficulty.

For any pair of integers $m$ and $n$ such that $3<m<n$, we provide an
infinite family of links, where each link in the family has a locally minimal
$n$-bridge position and a globally minimal $m$-bridge position. We accomplish
this by applying the criterion of Takao et al. The $n$-bridge position is
interesting because the corresponding bridge sphere is unperturbed, so it must
be perturbed at least once before it can be de-perturbed to attain a globally
minimal $m$-bridge sphere.

This paper proposes a novel perimeter-free regional traffic management
strategy for traffic networks under a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV)
environment. The proposed strategy requires CAVs, especially those with long
remaining travel distances, to temporarily wait at nearby parking facilities
when the network is congested. After a designated holding time, these CAVs are
allowed to re-enter the network. Doing so helps reduce congestion and improve
overall operational efficiency. Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches
that restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy
leverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way
that partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can
be easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the
maximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods.
Simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time
for vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of
the held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed
approach. Compared to the two benchmark perimeter control algorithms, the
proposed strategy is more robust against demand patterns and generates stronger
improvements in the operational efficiency. Importantly, since the proposed
strategy requires existing parking infrastructure, its performance has been
demonstrated under various configurations of parking locations and capacities.
Lastly, the proposed strategy is shown to be beneficial in a partial CAV
environment where only a subset of vehicles are available for holding.

We show that the moduli space of degree $e$ maps from smooth genus $g \ge 1$
curves to an arbitrary low degree smooth hypersurface is singular when $e$ is
large compared to $g$. We also give a lower bound for the dimension of the
singular locus.

The paper addresses some basic questions in the theory of finite time
dynamics and finite time predictions for non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical
systems. We are concerned with transport in phase spaces of such systems, and
analyze which subsets and when the orbits prefer to visit. An asymptotic
expansion of the decay of polynomial escape rates is obtained. Our approach is
based on the construction of operator renewal equations for open dynamical
systems and on their spectral analysis. In order to do this, we generalize the
Keller-Liverani perturbation technique. Applications to a large class of
one-dimensional non-uniformly expanding systems are considered.

The criteria for a baric algebra to have a unique weight homomorphism are
found. One of them requires the transition matrix from any semi-natural basis
to another semi-natural basis to be stochastic. Another one requires a certain
system of equations to have a unique non-trivial solution in the field.
Applying the latter criterion, we provide an example showing that Holgate's
well-known sufficient condition for the uniqueness of a weight homomorphism is
not necessary, and give also a new example of a baric algebra with two weight
homomorphisms.

In this paper, we develop the Oka theory for maps from families of open
Riemann surfaces to any Oka manifold, a new direction in the field. Along the
way, we prove Runge and Mergelyan approximation theorems and Weierstrass
interpolation theorem for families of complex structures on a smooth open
surface, with continuous or smooth dependence of the data and the approximating
functions on the complex structure. This implies global solvability of the
$\overline\partial$-equation on such families. We also obtain an Oka principle
for complex line bundles on families of open Riemann surfaces, and we show that
the holomorphic tangent bundles of open Riemann surfaces are holomorphically
trivial in families. We include applications to directed holomorphic immersions
and conformal minimal immersions.

We study a model of colored multiwebs, which generalizes the dimer model to
allow each vertex to be adjacent to $n_v$ edges. These objects can be
formulated as a random tiling of a graph with partial dimer covers. We examine
the case of a cycle graph, and in particular we describe the local correlations
of tiles in this setting.

We introduce the magnetic equivariant K-theory groups as the K-theory groups
associated to magnetic groups and their respective magnetic equivariant complex
bundles. We restrict the magnetic group to its subgroup of elements that act
complex linearly, and we show that this restriction induces a rational
isomorphism with the conjugation invariant part of the complex equivariant
K-theory of the restricted group. This isomorphism allows to calculate the
torsion free part of the magnetic equivariant K-theory groups reducing it to
known calculations in complex equivariant K-theory

Problems in probability theory prove to be one of the most challenging for
students. Here, we formulate and discuss four related problems in probability
theory that proved difficult for first to fourth-year undergraduate students
whose first language was not English. These examples emphasize how crucial it
is to understand the conditions and requirements of the problems precisely
before starting to solve them. We discuss the solutions to those problems in
detail, complement them with numerical estimations, and link the conditions in
the problems to the logical statements in Python programming language. We also
tested two widely used chatbots (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) by checking
their responses to these problems.

The paper aims at proposing an efficient and stable quasi-interpolation based
method for numerically computing the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of a vector
field. To this end, we first explicitly construct a matrix kernel in a general
form from polyharmonic splines such that it includes
divergence-free/curl-free/harmonic matrix kernels as special cases. Then we
apply the matrix kernel to vector decomposition via the convolution technique
together with the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. More precisely, we show that
if we convolve a vector field with a scaled divergence-free (curl-free) matrix
kernel, then the resulting divergence-free (curl-free) convolution sequence
converges to the corresponding divergence-free (curl-free) part of the
Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the field. Finally, by discretizing the
convolution sequence via certain quadrature rule, we construct a family of
(divergence-free/curl-free) quasi-interpolants for the Helmholtz-Hodge
decomposition (defined both in the whole space and over a bounded domain).
Corresponding error estimates derived in the paper show that our
quasi-interpolation based method yields convergent approximants to both the
vector field and its Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition

We develop and evaluate a method for learning solution operators to nonlinear
problems governed by partial differential equations. The approach is based on a
finite element discretization and aims at representing the solution operator by
an MLP that takes latent variables as input. The latent variables will
typically correspond to parameters in a parametrization of input data such as
boundary conditions, coefficients, and right-hand sides. The loss function is
most often an energy functional and we formulate efficient parallelizable
training algorithms based on assembling the energy locally on each element. For
large problems, the learning process can be made more efficient by using only a
small fraction of randomly chosen elements in the mesh in each iteration. The
approach is evaluated on several relevant test cases, where learning the
solution operator turns out to be beneficial compared to classical numerical
methods.

The quasi-2D electrostatic systems, characterized by periodicity in two
dimensions with a free third dimension, have garnered significant interest in
many fields. We apply the sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) approximation to the Laplace
kernel, dividing the interactions into near-field, mid-range, and long-range
components. The near-field component, singular but compactly supported in a
local domain, is directly calculated. The mid-range component is managed using
a procedure similar to nonuniform fast Fourier transforms in three dimensions.
The long-range component, which includes Gaussians of large variance, is
treated with polynomial interpolation/anterpolation in the free dimension and
Fourier spectral solver in the other two dimensions on proxy points. Unlike the
fast Ewald summation, which requires extensive zero padding in the case of high
aspect ratios, the separability of Gaussians allows us to handle such case
without any zero padding in the free direction. Furthermore, while NUFFTs
typically rely on certain upsampling in each dimension, and the truncated
kernel method introduces an additional factor of upsampling due to kernel
oscillation, our scheme eliminates the need for upsampling in any direction due
to the smoothness of Gaussians, significantly reducing computational cost for
large-scale problems. Finally, whereas all periodic fast multipole methods
require dividing the periodic tiling into a smooth far part and a near part
containing its nearest neighboring cells, our scheme operates directly on the
fundamental cell, resulting in better performance with simpler implementation.
We provide a rigorous error analysis showing that upsampling is not required in
NUFFT-like steps, achieving $O(N\log N)$ complexity with a small prefactor. The
performance of the scheme is demonstrated via extensive numerical experiments.

Markovian projections arise in problems where we aim to mimic the
one-dimensional marginal laws of an It\^o semimartingale by using another It\^o
process with simpler dynamics. In applications, Markovian projections are
useful in calibrating jump-diffusion models with both local and stochastic
features, leading to the study of the inversion problems. In this paper, we
invert the Markovian projections for pure jump processes, which can be used to
construct calibrated local stochastic intensity (LSI) models for credit risk
applications. Such models are jump process analogues of the notoriously hard to
construct local stochastic volatility (LSV) models used in equity modeling.

A new Goodman-Sharma modification of the Baskakov operator is presented for
approximation of bounded and continuous on $[0,\,\infty)$ functions. In our
study on the approximation error of the proposed operator we prove direct and
strong converse theorems with respect to a related K-functional. This operator
is linear but not positive. However it has the advantage of a higher order of
approximation compared to the Goodman-Sharma variant of the Baskakov operator
defined in 2005 by Finta.

We consider nonlinear Vlasov-type equations involving powers of the
zero-order moment and obtain a local existence and uniqueness result within a
framework of analytic functions. The proof employs a Banach fixed point
argument, where a contraction mapping is built upon the solutions of a
corresponding linearized problem. At a formal level, the considered nonlinear
kinetic equations are derived from a generalized Vlasov-Poisson type equation
under zero-electron-mass and quasi-neutrality assumptions, and are related to
compressible Euler equations through monokinetic distributions.

We introduce two families of random tridiagonal block matrices for which the
joint eigenvalue distributions can be computed explicitly. These distributions
are novel within random matrix theory, and exhibit interactions among
eigenvalue coordinates beyond the typical mean-field log-gas type. Leveraging
the matrix models, we go on to describe the point process limits at the edges
of the spectrum in two ways: through certain random differential operators, and
also in terms of coupled systems of diffusions. Along the way we establish
several algebraic identities involving sums of Vandermonde determinant
products.

We discuss $(K,N)$-convexity and gradient flows for $(K,N)$-convex
functionals on metric spaces, in the case of real $K$ and negative $N$. In this
generality, it is necessary to consider functionals unbounded from below and/or
above, possibly attaining as values both the positive and the negative
infinity. We prove several properties of gradient flows of $(K,N)$-convex
functionals characterized by Evolution Variational Inequalities, including
contractivity, regularity, and uniqueness.

We prove global well-posedness and scattering for solutions to the
mass-critical inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
$i\partial_{t}u+\Delta u=\pm |x|^{-b}|u|^{\frac{4-2b}{d}}u$ for large
$L^2(\mathbb{R} ^d)$ initial data with $d\ge3,0<b<\min \left\{ 2,\frac{d}{2}
\right\}$; in the focusing case, we require that the mass is strictly less than
that of the ground state.
  Compared with the classical Schr\"odinger case ($b=0$, Dodson, J. Amer. Math.
Soc. (2012), Adv. Math. (2015)), the main differences for the inhomogeneous
case ($b>0$) are that the presence of the inhomogeneity $|x|^{-b}$ creates a
nontrivial singularity at the origin, and breaks the translation symmetry as
well as the Galilean invariance of the equation, which makes the establishment
of the profile decomposition and long time Strichartz estimates more difficult.
To overcome these difficulties, we perform the concentration
compactness/rigidity methods of [Kenig and Merle, Invent. Math. (2006)] in the
Lorentz space framework, and reduces the problem to the exclusion of almost
periodic solutions. The exclusion of these solutions will utilize fractional
estimates and long time Strichartz estimates in Lorentz spaces.
  In our study, we obseve that the decay of the inhomogeneity $|x|^{-b}$ at
infinity prevents the concentration of the almost periodic solution at infinity
in either physical or frequency space. Therefore, we can use classical Morawetz
estimates, rather than interaction Morawetz estimates, to exclude the existence
of the quasi-soliton.

We find identities involving differential operators in the generic artinian
reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial sphere in any positive
characteristic. These identities generalize the characteristic 2 identities
used by Papadakis and Petrotou to give a proof of the algebraic g-conjecture.
We use these identities to prove the anisotropy of certain forms on the generic
artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring and to prove weak Lefschetz
results.

For the Hamming graph $H(n,q)$, where a $q$ is a constant prime power and $n$
grows, we construct perfect colorings without non-essential arguments such that
$n$ depends exponentially on the off-diagonal part of the quotient matrix. In
particular, we construct unbalanced Boolean ($q=2$) functions such that the
number of essential arguments depends exponentially on the degree of the
function.

We adapt algorithms for resolving the singularities of complex algebraic
varieties to prove that the natural map of homology theories from complex
bordism to the bordism theory of complex derived orbifolds splits. In
equivariant stable homotopy theory, our techniques yield a splitting of
homology theories for the map from bordism to the equivariant bordism theory of
a finite group $\Gamma$, given by assigning to a manifold its product with
$\Gamma$. In symplectic topology, and using recent work of
Abouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirshi-Swaminathan, we conclude that one can define
complex cobordism-valued Gromov-Witten invariant for arbirary (closed)
symplectic manifolds. We apply our results to constrain the topology of the
space of Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$. The methods we develop apply to
normally complex orbifolds, and will hence lead to applications in symplectic
topology that rely on moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian
boundary conditions.

We prove two results concerning percolation on general graphs.
  - We establish the converse of the classical Peierls argument: if the
critical parameter for (uniform) percolation satisfies $p_c<1$, then the number
of minimal cutsets of size $n$ separating a given vertex from infinity is
bounded above exponentially in $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Babson and
Benjamini from 1999.
  - We prove that $p_c<1$ for every uniformly transient graph. This solves a
problem raised by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi, Severo and Yadin, and
provides a new proof that $p_c<1$ for every transitive graph of superlinear
growth.

Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions
with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous
quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and
spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend
this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from
multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by
constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well
as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that
generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos
method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which
can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos
provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to
the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster
convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable
two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of
external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or
statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are
performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton
correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.

Undercompressive shocks are a special type of discontinuities that satisfy
the viscous profile criterion rather than the Lax inequalities. These shocks
can appear as a solution to systems of two or more conservation laws. This
paper presents the construction of the undercompressive shock surface for two
types of diffusion matrices. The first type is the identity matrix. The second
one is the capillarity matrix associated with the proper modeling of the
diffusive effects caused by capillary pressure. We show that the structure of
the undercompressive surface for the different diffusion matrices is similar.
We also show how the choice of the capillarity matrix influences the solutions
to the Riemann problem.

We define a normed matrix factorization category and a notion of bounding
cochains for objects of this category. We classify bounding cochains up to
gauge equivalence for spherical objects and use this classification to define
numerical invariants. These invariants are expected to correspond under mirror
symmetry to the open Gromov-Witten invariants with only boundary constraints of
Lagrangian rational cohomology spheres defined by the second author and
Tukachinsky.
  For each Delzant polytope, we construct a normed matrix factorization
category. For Delzant polytopes satisfying a combinatorial relative spin
condition, we construct an object of this category called the Dirac
factorization. The Dirac factorization is expected to correspond under mirror
symmetry to the Lagrangian submanifold given by the real locus of the toric
symplectic manifold associated to the Delzant polytope. In the case of the
$n$-simplex for $n$ odd, we show that the Dirac factorization is spherical,
mirroring the fact that $\mathbb{R} P^n$ is a rational cohomology sphere. For
$n = 1,$ we show the numerical invariants of the Dirac factorization coincide
with the open Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{R} P^1 \subset \mathbb{C}
P^1.$ For $n = 3$ in low degrees, computer calculations verify that the
numerical invariants of the Dirac factorization coincide with the open
Gromov-Witten-Welschinger invariants of $\mathbb{R}P^3 \subset \mathbb{C} P^3.$
Although $\mathbb{R} P^n$ is trivial in the Fukaya category of $\mathbb{C} P^n$
over any field of characteristic zero, the above results can be seen as a
manifestation of mirror symmetry over a Novikov ring.

We prove the exact worst-case convergence rate of gradient descent for smooth
strongly convex optimization, with respect to the performance criterion $\Vert
\nabla f(x_N)\Vert^2/(f(x_0)-f_*)$. The proof differs from the previous one by
Rotaru \emph{et al.} [RGP24], and is based on the performance estimation
methodology [DT14].

We prove the exact worst-case convergence rate of gradient descent for smooth
strongly convex optimization, with respect to the performance criterion
$(f(x_N)-f_*)/\Vert x_0-x_*\Vert^2$. This rate was previously conjectured in
[DT14; THG17].

For every Toeplitz sequence $x$, one can identify a period structure ${\bf
p}=(p_i)_{i\geq 0}$ which leads to a Bratteli-Vershik realization of the
associated Toeplitz shift; we call this period structure {\it constructive}.
Let $(X,\sigma,x)$ and $(Y,\sigma,y)$ be Toeplitz shifts where $x\in X$ and
$y\in Y$ are Toeplitz sequences with constructive period structures
$(p^n)_{n\geq 1}$ and $(q^n)_{n\geq 1}$, respectively. Using the
Bratteli-Vershik realization of factor maps between Toeplitz shifts, We prove
that if $p$ and $q$ share the same prime divisors and neither divides the
other, there cannot be any topological factoring $ \pi:(X,\sigma)\rightarrow
(Y,\sigma)$ with $\pi(x)=y$.

Distributed learning algorithms, such as the ones employed in Federated
Learning (FL), require communication compression to reduce the cost of client
uploads. The compression methods used in practice are often biased, which
require error feedback to achieve convergence when the compression is
aggressive. In turn, error feedback requires client-specific control variates,
which directly contradicts privacy-preserving principles and requires stateful
clients. In this paper, we propose Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), a
novel distributed learning framework that allows highly compressible client
updates by exploiting past aggregated updates, and does not require control
variates. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative
algorithm and provide a theoretical proof of CAFe's superiority to Distributed
Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-smooth
regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results confirm that
CAFe consistently outperforms distributed learning with direct compression and
highlight the compressibility of the client updates with CAFe.

Negami's famous planar cover conjecture is equivalent to the statement that a
connected graph can be embedded in the projective plane if and only if it has a
projective planar cover. In 1999, Hlin\v{e}n\'y proposed extending this
conjecture to higher genus non-orientable surfaces. In this paper, we put
forward a natural extension that encompasses orientable surfaces as well; for
every compact surface $\Sigma$, a connected graph $G$ has a finite cover
embeddable in $\Sigma$ if and only if $G$ is embeddable in a surface covered by
$\Sigma$.
  As evidence toward this, we prove that for every surface $\Sigma$, the
connected graphs with a finite cover embeddable in $\Sigma$ have bounded Euler
genus. Moreover, we show that these extensions of Negami's conjecture are
decidable for every compact surface of sufficiently large Euler genus,
surpassing what is known for Negami's original conjecture. We also prove the
natural analogue for countable graphs embeddable into a compact (orientable)
surface. More precisely, we prove that a connected countable graph $G$ has a
finite ply cover that embeds into a compact (orientable) surface if and only if
$G$ embeds into a compact (orientable) surface.
  Our most general theorem, from which these results are derived, is that there
is a constant $c>0$ such that for every surface $\Sigma$, there exists a
decreasing function $p_\Sigma:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $\lim_{g\to
\infty}p_\Sigma(g) =0$ such that every finite cover embeddable in $\Sigma$ of
any connected graph with Euler genus $g\ge c$ has ply at most $p_\Sigma(g)$.

We discuss how to understand the asymptotic resurgence number of a pair of
graded families of ideals from combinatorial data of their associated convex
bodies. When the families consist of monomial ideals, the convex bodies being
considered are the Newton-Okounkov bodies of the families. When ideals in the
second family are classical invariant ideals, for instance, determinantal
ideals or ideals of Pfaffians, these convex bodies are constructed from the
associated Rees packages.

We consider an inverse problem involving the reconstruction of the solution
to a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with unknown boundary
conditions. Instead of direct boundary data, we are provided with a large
dataset of boundary observations for typical solutions (collective data) and a
bulk measurement of a specific realization. To leverage this collective data,
we first compress the boundary data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
in a linear expansion. Next, we identify a possible nonlinear low-dimensional
structure in the expansion coefficients using an auto-encoder, which provides a
parametrization of the dataset in a lower-dimensional latent space. We then
train a neural network to map the latent variables representing the boundary
data to the solution of the PDE. Finally, we solve the inverse problem by
optimizing a data-fitting term over the latent space.
  We analyze the underlying stabilized finite element method in the linear
setting and establish optimal error estimates in the $H^1$ and $L^2$-norms. The
nonlinear problem is then studied numerically, demonstrating the effectiveness
of our approach.

Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that
inherently allows edge devices to maintain their local training data, thus
providing some level of privacy. However, FL's model updates still pose a risk
of privacy leakage, which must be mitigated. Over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) is an
adapted FL design for wireless edge networks that leverages the natural
superposition property of the wireless medium. We propose a wireless physical
layer (PHY) design for OTA-FL which improves differential privacy (DP) through
a decentralized, dynamic power control that utilizes both inherent Gaussian
noise in the wireless channel and a cooperative jammer (CJ) for additional
artificial noise generation when higher privacy levels are required. Although
primarily implemented within the Upcycled-FL framework, where a
resource-efficient method with first-order approximations is used at every even
iteration to decrease the required information from clients, our power control
strategy is applicable to any FL framework, including FedAvg and FedProx as
shown in the paper. This adaptation showcases the flexibility and effectiveness
of our design across different learning algorithms while maintaining a strong
emphasis on privacy. Our design removes the need for client-side artificial
noise injection for DP, utilizing a cooperative jammer to enhance privacy
without affecting transmission efficiency for higher privacy demands. Privacy
analysis is provided using the Moments Accountant method. We perform a
convergence analysis for non-convex objectives to tackle heterogeneous data
distributions, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between privacy and
accuracy. Numerical results show that our approach with various FL algorithms
outperforms the state-of-the-art under the same DP conditions on the non-i.i.d.
FEMNIST dataset, and highlight the cooperative jammer's effectiveness in
ensuring strict privacy.

Dually flat statistical manifolds provide a rich toolbox for investigations
around the learning process. We prove that such manifolds are Monge-Amp\`ere
manifolds. Examples of such manifolds include the space of exponential
probability distributions on finite sets and the Boltzmann manifolds. Our
investigations of Boltzmann manifolds lead us to prove that Monge-Amp\`ere
operators control learning methods for Boltzmann machines. Using local trivial
fibrations (webs) we demonstrate that on such manifolds the webs are
parallelizable and can be constructed using a generalisation of Ceva's theorem.
Assuming that our domain satisfies certain axioms of 2D topological quantum
field theory we show that locally the learning can be defined on hexagonal
structures. This brings a new geometric perspective for defining the optimal
learning process.

The main mathematical manifestation of the Stark effect in quantum mechanics
is the shift and the formation of clusters of eigenvalues when a spherical
Hamiltonian is perturbed by lower order terms. Understanding this mechanism
turned out to be fundamental in the description of the large-time asymptotics
of the associated Schr\"odinger groups and can be responsible for the lack of
dispersion in Fanelli, Felli, Fontelos and Primo [Comm. Math. Phys., 324(2013),
1033-1067; 337(2015), 1515-1533]. Recently, Miao, Su, and Zheng introduced in
[Tran. Amer. Math. Soc., 376(2023), 1739--1797] a family of spectrally
projected intertwining operators, reminiscent of the Kato's wave operators, in
the case of constant perturbations on the sphere (inverse-square potential),
and also proved their boundedness in $L^p$. Our aim is to establish a general
framework in which some suitable intertwining operators can be defined also for
non constant spherical perturbations in space dimensions 2 and higher. In
addition, we investigate the mapping properties between $L^p$-spaces of these
operators. In 2D, we prove a complete result, for the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian
with a (fixed) magnetic potential an electric potential, both scaling critical,
allowing us to prove dispersive estimates, uniform resolvent estimates, and
$L^p$-bounds of Bochner--Riesz means. In higher dimensions, apart from
recovering the example of inverse-square potential, we can conjecture a
complete result in presence of some symmetries (zonal potentials), and open
some interesting spectral problems concerning the asymptotics of
eigenfunctions.

Magic State Distillation (MSD) has been a research focus for fault-tolerant
quantum computing due to the need for non-Clifford resource in gaining quantum
advantage. Although many of the MSD protocols so far are based on stabilizer
codes with transversal $T$ gates, there exists quite several protocols that
don't fall into this class. We propose a method to map MSD protocols to
iterative dynamical systems under the framework of stabilizer reduction. With
our mapping, we are able to analyze the performance of MSD protocols using
techniques from dynamical systems theory, easily simulate the distillation
process of input states under arbitrary noise model and visualize it using flow
diagram. We apply our mapping to common MSD protocols for $\ket{T}$ state and
find some interesting properties: The $[[15, 1, 3]]$ code may distill states
corresponding to $\sqrt{T}$ gate and the $[[5, 1, 3]]$ code can distill the
magic state for corresponding to the $T$ gate. Besides, we examine the exotic
MSD protocols that may distill into other magic states proposed in [Eur. Phys.
J. D 70, 55 (2016)] and identify the condition for distillable magic states. We
also study new MSD protocols generated by concatenating different codes and
numerically demonstrate that concatenation can generate MSD protocols with
various magic states. By concatenating efficient codes with exotic codes, we
can reduce the overhead of the exotic MSD protocols. We believe our proposed
method will be a useful tool for simulating and visualization MSD protocols for
canonical MSD protocols on $\ket{T}$ as well as other unexplored MSD protocols
for other states.

In a paper from 1987, Gruenhage defined a class of topological spaces that
now bear his name, and used it to solve a problem of Talagrand on the existence
of dense $G_\delta$ metrizable subsets of Gul'ko compact spaces. Gruenhage's
paper became highly influential among researchers in renorming theory, a branch
of Banach space theory. In this paper we survey Gruenhage and related spaces,
and their interactions with renorming theory.

In \cite{fgn1}, the hydrodynamic limit in the diffusive scaling of the
symmetric simple exclusion process with a finite number of slow bonds of
strength $n^{-\beta}$ has been studied. Here $n$ is the scaling parameter and
$\beta>0$ is fixed. As shown in \cite{fgn1}, when $\beta>1$, such a limit is
given by the heat equation with Neumann boundary conditions. In this work, we
find more non-trivial super-diffusive scaling limits for this dynamics. Assume
that there are $k$ equally spaced slow bonds in the system.
  If $k$ is fixed and the time scale is $k^2n^\theta$, with $\theta\in
(2,1+\beta)$, the density is asymptotically constant in each of the $k$ boxes,
and equal to the initial expected mass in that box, i.e., there is no time
evolution. If $k$ is fixed and the time scale is $k^2n^{1+\beta}$, then the
density is also spatially constant in each box, but evolves in time according
to the discrete heat equation. Finally, if the time scale is $k^2n^{1+\beta}$
and, additionally, the number of boxes $k$ increases to infinity, then the
system converges to the continuous heat equation on the torus, with no boundary
conditions.

Lazy burning is a recently introduced variation of burning where only one set
of vertices is chosen to burn in the first round. In hypergraphs, lazy burning
spreads when all but one vertex in a hyperedge is burned. The lazy burning
number is the minimum number of initially burned vertices that eventually burns
all vertices. We give several equivalent characterizations of lazy burning on
hypergraphs using matchings and zero forcing, and then apply these to give new
bounds and complexity results.
  We prove that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph $H$ equals its order
minus the maximum cardinality of a certain matching on its incidence graph.
Using this characterization, we give a formula for the lazy burning number of a
dual hypergraph and give new bounds on the lazy burning number based on various
hypergraph parameters. We show that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph may
be characterized by a maximal subhypergraph that results from iteratively
deleting vertices in singleton hyperedges.
  We prove that lazy burning on a hypergraph is equivalent to zero forcing on
its incidence graph and show an equivalence between skew zero forcing on a
graph and lazy burning on its neighborhood hypergraph. As a result, we show
that finding an upper bound on the lazy burning number of a hypergraph is
NP-complete, which resolves a conjecture from \cite{BJR}. By applying lazy
burning, we show that computing an upper bound on the skew zero forcing number
for bipartite graphs is NP-complete. We finish with open problems.

We derive a generalisation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parametrization.
Most form factors (FFs) in $b$-hadron decays exhibit additional branch cuts --
namely subthreshold and anomalous branch cuts -- beyond the ``standard''
unitarity cut. These additional cuts cannot be adequately accounted for by the
BGL parametrization. For instance, these cuts arise in the FFs for $B\to
D^{(*)}$, $B\to K^{(*)}$, and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda$ processes, which are
particularly relevant from a phenomenological standpoint. We demonstrate how to
parametrize such FFs and derive unitarity bounds in the presence of
subthreshold and/or anomalous branch cuts. Our work paves the way for a wide
range of new FF analyses based solely on first principles, thereby minimising
systematic uncertainties.

We analytically determine the large central charge asymptotic expansion of
the Virasoro conformal blocks entering in four-point functions with external
degenerate operators on a sphere in $2d$ CFTs, and study its resurgence
properties as a function of the conformal cross-ratio $z$. We focus on the
cases of four heavy level-two $(2,1)$ degenerate operators, and two $(2,1)$
heavy degenerate ones plus two arbitrary light operators. The $1/c$ asymptotic
series is Borel summable for generic values of $z$, but it jumps when a Stokes
line is crossed. Starting from the $1/c$ series of the identity block, we show
how a resurgent analysis allows us to completely determine the other Virasoro
block and in fact to reconstruct the full correlator. We also show that
forbidden singularities, known to exist in correlators with two heavy and two
light operators, appear with four heavy operators as well. In both cases, they
are turning points emanating Stokes lines, artefacts of the asymptotic
expansion, and we show how they are non perturbatively resolved. More general
correlators and implications for gravitational theories in $\text{AdS}_{3}$ are
briefly discussed. Our results are based on new asymptotic expansions for large
parameters $(a,b,c)$ of certain hypergeometric functions $\,_2 F_1(a,b,c;z)$
which can be useful in general.

We calculate the four-graviton scattering amplitude in Type II superstring
theory at one-loop up to seventh order in the low-energy expansion through the
recently developed iterated integral formalism of Modular Graph Functions
(MGFs). We propose a new assignment of transcendental weight to the numbers
that appear in the amplitude, which leads to a violation of uniform
transcendentality. Furthermore, the machinery of the novel method allows us to
propose a general form of the amplitude, which suggests that the expansion is
expressible in terms of single-valued multiple zeta values and logarithmic
derivatives of the Riemann zeta function at positive and negative odd integers.

We show that if $H$ is a Hopf algebra with bijective antipode and $B \subset
A$ is a faithfully flat $H$-Galois extension, then $A$ is homologically smooth
if $H$ and $B$ are.

We prove that most Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type are Hopfian,
meaning that every self-epimorphism is an isomorphism. The class covered by our
result is generic, in the sense of Goldsborough-Vaskou. Moreover, assuming the
residual finiteness of certain hyperbolic groups with an explicit presentation,
we get that all large and hyperbolic type Artin groups are residually finite.
We also show that most quotients of the five-holed sphere mapping class group
are hierarchically hyperbolic, up to taking powers of the normal generators of
the kernels. The main tool we use to prove both results is a Dehn-filling-like
procedure for short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (these also include e.g.
non-geometric 3-manifolds, and triangle- and square-free RAAGs).

Advancements in sensor technology offer significant insights into vehicle
conditions, unlocking new venues to enhance fleet operations. While current
vehicle health management models provide accurate predictions of vehicle
failures, they often fail to integrate these forecasts into operational
decision-making, limiting their practical impact. This paper addresses this gap
by incorporating sensor-driven failure predictions into a single-vehicle
routing problem with time windows. A maintenance cost function is introduced to
balance two critical trade-offs: premature maintenance, which leads to
underutilization of remaining useful life, and delayed maintenance, which
increases the likelihood of breakdowns. Routing problems with time windows are
inherently challenging, and integrating maintenance considerations adds
significantly to its computational complexity. To address this, we develop a
new solution method, called the Iterative Alignment Method (IAM), building on
the structural properties of the problem. IAM generates high-quality solutions
even in large-size instances where Gurobi cannot find any solutions. Moreover,
compared to the traditional periodic maintenance strategy, our sensor-driven
approach to maintenance decisions shows improvements in operational and
maintenance costs as well as in overall vehicle reliability.

We consider $N$ i.i.d. Ising spins with mean $m\in (-1,1)$ whose interactions
are described by a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian with a quartic
correction. This model was recently introduced by Bolthausen in \cite{Bolt2} as
a toy model to understand whether a second moment argument can be used to
derive the replica symmetric formula in the full high temperature regime if
$m\neq 0$. In \cite{Bolt2}, Bolthausen suggested that a natural analogue of the
de Almeida-Thouless condition for the toy model is
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:conj} \beta^2(1-m^2)^2\leq 1. \, \, \, \, \, \, \,
\, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, (1)\end{equation} Here, $\beta \geq 0$
corresponds to the inverse temperature. While the second moment method implies
replica symmetry for $\beta $ sufficiently small, Bolthausen showed that the
method fails to prove replica symmetry in the full region described by (1). A
natural question that was left open in \cite{Bolt2} is whether (1) correctly
characterizes the high temperature phase of the toy model. In this note, we
show that this is indeed not the case. We prove that if $|m| \geq m_*$, for
some $m_* \in (0,1)$, the limiting free energy of the toy model is negative for
suitable $\beta $ that satisfy (1).

Traditionally, fractional counting processes, such as the fractional Poisson
process, etc. have been defined using fractional differential and integral
operators. Recently, Laskin (2024) introduced a generalized fractional counting
process (FCP) by changing the probability mass function (pmf) of the time
fractional Poisson process using the generalized three-parameter Mittag-Leffler
function. Here, we study some additional properties for the FCP and introduce a
time-changed fractional counting process (TCFCP), defined by time-changing the
FCP with an independent L\'evy subordinator. We derive distributional
properties such as the Laplace transform, probability generating function, the
moments generating function, mean, and variance for the TCFCP. Some results
related to waiting time distribution and the first passage time distribution
are also discussed. We define the multiplicative and additive compound variants
for the FCP and the TCFCP and examine their distributional characteristics with
some typical examples. We explore some interesting connections of the TCFCP
with Bell polynomials by introducing subordinated generalized fractional Bell
polynomials. It is shown that the moments of the TCFCP can be represented in
terms of the subordinated generalized fractional Bell polynomials. Finally, we
present the application of the FCP in a shock deterioration model.

The Karp--Sipser algorithm consists in removing recursively the leaves as
well their unique neighbours and all isolated vertices of a given graph. The
remaining graph obtained when there is no leaf left is called the Karp--Sipser
core. When the underlying graph is the classical sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi
random graph $ \mathrm{G}[n, \lambda/n]$, it is known to exhibit a phase
transition at $\lambda = \mathrm{e}$. We show that at criticality, the
Karp--Sipser core has size of order $n^{3/5}$, which proves a conjecture of
Bauer and Golinelli. We provide the asymptotic law of this renormalized size as
well as a description of the distribution of the core as a graph. Our approach
relies on the differential equation method, and builds up on a previous work on
a configuration model with bounded degrees.

Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information
theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications,
including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node
centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of
quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution.
However, it is important for many applications to understand the long-time
behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their
evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on
networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks
that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an
analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that
depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building
on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs
in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster
networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key
structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.

$N$-Brownian bees is a branching-selection particle system in $\mathbb{R}^d$
in which $N$ particles behave as independent binary branching Brownian motions,
and where at each branching event, we remove the particle furthest from the
origin. We study a variant in which $d=1$ and particles have an additional
drift $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. We show that there is a critical value, $\mu_c^N$,
and three distinct regimes (sub-critical, critical, and super-critical) and we
describe the behaviour of the system in each case. In the sub-critical regime,
the system is positive Harris recurrent and has an invariant distribution; in
the super-critical regime, the system is transient; and in the critical case,
after rescaling, the system behaves like a single reflected Brownian motion.
  We also show that the critical drift $\mu_c^N$ is in fact the speed of the
well-studied $N$-BBM process, and give a rigorous proof for the speed of
$N$-BBM, which was missing in the literature.

We prove a general version of Egorov's theorem for evolution propagators in
the Euclidean space, in the Weyl--H\"ormander framework of metrics on the phase
space. Mild assumptions on the Hamiltonian allow for a wide range of
applications that we describe in the paper, including Schr\"odinger, wave and
transport evolutions. We also quantify an Ehrenfest time and describe the full
symbol of the conjugated operator. Our main result is a consequence of a
stronger theorem on the propagation of quantum partitions of unity.

We study a stealthy range-sensor placement problem where a set of range
sensors are to be placed with respect to targets to effectively localize them
while maintaining a degree of stealthiness from the targets. This is an open
and challenging problem since two competing objectives must be balanced: (a)
optimally placing the sensors to maximize their ability to localize the targets
and (b) minimizing the information the targets gather regarding the sensors. We
provide analytical solutions in 2D for the case of any number of sensors that
localize two targets.

We prove that every element of a Lipschitz-free space admits an expression as
a convex series of elements with compact support. As a consequence, we conclude
that all extreme points of the unit ball of Lipschitz-free spaces are
elementary molecules, solving a long-standing problem. We also deduce that all
elements of a Lipschitz-free space with the Radon-Nikod\'ym property can be
expressed as convex integrals of molecules. Our results are based on a recent
theory of integral representation for functionals on Lipschitz spaces which
draws on classical Choquet theory, due to the third named author.

We introduce a notion of Lorentzian metric space which drops the boundedness
condition from our previous work and argue that the properties defining our
spaces are minimal. In fact, they are defined by three conditions given by (a)
the reverse triangle inequality for chronologically related events, (b)
Lorentzian distance continuity and relative compactness of chronological
diamonds, and (c) a distinguishing condition via the Lorentzian distance
function. By adding a countably generating condition we confirm the validity of
desirable properties for our spaces including the Polish property. The
definition of (pre)length space given in our previous work on the bounded case
is generalised to this setting. We also define a notion of Gromov-Hausdorff
convergence for Lorentzian metric spaces and prove that (pre)length spaces are
GH-stable. It is also shown that our (sequenced) Lorentzian metric space bring
a natural quasi-uniformity (resp.\ quasi-metric). Finally, an explicit
comparison with other recent constructions based on our previous work on
bounded Lorentzian metric spaces is presented.

A quad-mesh rigid origami is a continuously deformable panel-hinge structure
where rigid zero-thickness quad panels are connected by rotational hinges in
the combinatorics of a grid. This article introduces two new families of
generalized sector-angle-periodic quad-mesh rigid origami stitched from
proportional and equimodular couplings, expanding beyond commonly known
variations such as V-hedra (discrete Voss surface/eggbox pattern), anti-V-hedra
(flat-foldable pattern) and T-hedra (trapezoidal pattern). We conjecture that
as the mesh is refined to infinity, these quad-mesh rigid origami converges to
special ruled surfaces in the limit, supported by multiple lines of evidence.
Additionally, we discuss the convergence of tangent planes, metric-related, and
curvature-related properties.

Much of the engineering behind current wireless systems has focused on
designing an efficient and high-throughput downlink to support human-centric
communication such as video streaming and internet browsing. This paper looks
ahead to design of the uplink, anticipating the emergence of machine-type
communication (MTC) and the confluence of sensing, communication, and
distributed learning. We demonstrate that grant-free multiple access is
possible even in the presence of highly time-varying channels. Our approach
provides a pathway to standards adoption, since it is built on enhancing the
2-step random access procedure which is already part of the 5GNR standard. This
2-step procedure uses Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences as preambles that point to
radio resources which are then used to upload data. We also use ZC sequences as
preambles / pilots, but we process signals in the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain
rather than the time-domain. We demonstrate that it is possible to detect
multiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread using a
receiver with no knowledge of the channel other than the worst case delay and
Doppler spreads. Our approach depends on the mathematical properties of ZC
sequences in the DD domain. We derive a closed form expression for ZC pilots in
the DD domain, we characterize the possible self-ambiguity functions, and we
determine the magnitude of the possible cross-ambiguity functions. These
mathematical properties enable detection of multiple pilots through solution of
a compressed sensing problem. The columns of the compressed sensing matrix are
the translates of individual ZC pilots in delay and Doppler. We show that
columns in the design matrix satisfy a coherence property that makes it
possible to detect multiple preambles in a single Zak-OTFS subframe using
One-Step Thresholding (OST), which is an algorithm with low complexity.

The main result of this note asserts that a strong form of the Matroid Minor
Conjecture due to J. Draisma is not true, i.e., there exist properly ascending
chains of $S_\infty$-stable ideals in the affine coordinate ring of the affine
infinite Grassmannian, where $S_\infty$ is the infinite symmetric group. In
fact, we explicitly construct such an ascending chain. His conjectures on
topological noetherian property for the affine infinite Grassmannian remain
open though.

In [3], the authors used the Legendre transform to give a tractable method
for studying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in terms of sums of Gaussian
kernels. In this paper, we prove a variant for sums of cosine similarity-based
kernel functions, which requires considering the more general "$c$-transform"
from optimal transport theory [16]. We then apply these methods to a point
cloud arising from a recent breakthrough study, which exhibits a toroidal
structure in the brain activity of rats [11]. A key part of this application is
that the transport map and transformed density function arising from the
theorem replace certain delicate preprocessing steps related to density-based
denoising and subsampling.

Given an initial point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and a sequence of vectors $v_1,
v_2, \dots$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we define a greedy sequence by setting $x_{n} =
x_{n-1} \pm v_n$ where the sign is chosen so as to minimize $\|x_n\|$. We prove
that if the vectors $v_i$ are chosen uniformly at random from
$\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ then elements of the sequence are, on average, approximately
at distance $\|x_n\| \sim \sqrt{\pi d/8}$ from the origin. We show that the
sequence $(\|x_n\|)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has an invariant measure $\pi_d$ depending
only on $d$ and we determine its mean and study its decay for all $d$. We also
investigate a completely deterministic example in $d=2$ where the $v_n$ are
derived from the van der Corput sequence. Several additional examples are
considered.

The notion of a proper Ellis semigroup compactification is introduced.
Ellis's functional approach shows how to obtain them from totally bounded
equiuniformities on a phase space $X$ when the acting group $G$ is with the
topology of pointwise convergence and the $G$-space $(G, X, \curvearrowright)$
is $G$-Tychonoff.
  The correspondence between proper Ellis semigroup compactifications of a
topological group and special totally bounded equiuniformities (called Ellis
equiuniformities) on a topological group is established. The Ellis
equiuniformity on a topological transformation group $G$ from the maximal
equiuniformity on a phase space $G/H$ in the case of its uniformly
equicontinuous action is compared with Roelcke uniformity on $G$.
  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups $S\,(X)$
(the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and $Aut\,(X)$ (automorphism
group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology. It is
shown that this approach can be applied to the unitary group of a Hilbert
space.

Motivated by the optimality system associated with controlled (forward)
Volterra integral equations (FVIEs, for short), the well-posedness of coupled
forward-backward Voterra integral equations (FBVIEs, for short) is studied. The
main feature of FBVIEs is that the unknown $\{(X(t,s),Y(t,s))\}$ has two
arguments. By taking $t$ as a parameter and $s$ as a (time) variable, one can
regard FBVIE as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs, for short),
with infinite-dimensional space values
$\{(X(\cdot,s),Y(\cdot,s));\,s\in[0,T]\}$. To establish the well-posedness of
such an FBVIE, a new non-local monotonicity condition is introduced, by which a
bridge in infinite-dimensional spaces is constructed. Then by generalizing the
method of continuation developed by \cite{Hu-Peng1995,Yong1997,Peng-Wu1999} for
differential equations, we have established the well-posedness of FBVIEs.The
key is to apply the chain rule to the mapping $t\mapsto\big[\int_\cdot^T\langle
Y(s,s),X(s,\cdot)\rangle ds +\langle G(X(T,T)),X(T,\cdot)\rangle\big](t)$.

We highlight a hidden aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to
couple with a dilaton field: $\ $the dynamics of the dilaton can be used to
induce variations in Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and the speed of light
$c$. This mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in
$\textit{curved}$ spacetimes offers novel insights into the origin of late-time
cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.

We show that for $5/6$-th of all primes $p$, Hilbert's 10-th Problem is
unsolvable for $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_3, \sqrt[3]{p})$. We also show that there is
an infinite set $S$ of square free integers such tha Hilbert's 10-th Problem is
unsolvable over the number fields $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_3, \sqrt{D}, \sqrt[3]{p})$
for every $D \in S$ and every prime $p \equiv 2,5 \pmod{9}$. We use the CM
elliptic curves $Y^2=X^3-432D^2$ associated to the cube sum problem, with $D$
varying in suitable congruence class, in our proof.

This work is concerned with the computation of the first-order variation for
one-dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations. In the case of shock
waves the main challenge is addressed by developing a numerical method to
compute the evolution of the generalized tangent vector introduced by Bressan
and Marson (1995). Our basic strategy is to combine the conservative numerical
schemes and a novel expression of the interface conditions for the tangent
vectors along the discontinuity. Based on this, we propose a simple numerical
method to compute the tangent vectors for general hyperbolic systems. Numerical
results are presented for Burgers' equation and a 2 x 2 hyperbolic system with
two genuinely nonlinear fields.

We give a concise presentation for the outer automorphism group of a free
product with no free rank, whose factors are non-trivial, freely
indecomposable, not infinite cyclic, and pairwise non-isomorphic. This is
achieved by considering the action of the outer automorphism group on a
particular subcomplex of `Outer Space', which we show to be simply connected.
We then apply a theorem of K. S. Brown to extract our presentation.

We introduce the Habiro ring of a number field $\mathbb{K}$ and modules over
it graded by $K_3(\mathbb{K})$. Elements of these modules are collections of
power series at each complex root of unity that arithmetically glue with each
other after applying a Frobenius endomorphism, and after dividing at each prime
by a collection of series that depends solely on an element of the Bloch group.
We prove that the perturbative Chern-Simons invariants of knots and 3-manifolds
are elements of these modules and identify these elements with expansions of
certain admissible series of Kontsevich-Soibelman at roots of unity, suggesting
that some Donaldson-Thomas invariants have arithmetic meaning and that some
elements of the Habiro ring of a number field have enumerative meaning.

We examine the energy-critical nonlinear heat equation in critical spaces for
any dimension greater or equal than three. The aim of this paper is two-fold.
First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on initial data at or
below the ground state that dichotomizes the behavior of solutions.
Specifically, this criterion determines whether the solution will either exist
globally with energy decaying to zero over time or blow up in finite time.
Secondly, we derive the decay rate for solutions that exist globally. These
results offer a comprehensive characterization of solution behavior for
energy-critical conditions in higher-dimensional settings

This paper investigates the pathwise uniform convergence in probability of
fully discrete finite-element approximations for the two-dimensional stochastic
Navier-Stokes equations with multiplicative noise, subject to no-slip boundary
conditions. Assuming Lipschitz-continuous diffusion coefficients and under mild
conditions on the initial data, we establish that the full discretization
achieves linear convergence in space and nearly half-order convergence in time.

We construct the higher genus Open-Closed Gromov-Witten potential as a
solution of the quantum master equation defined up to quantum master isotopy.

Gateway will represent a primary logistic infrastructure in cislunar space.
The identification of efficient orbit transfers capable of connecting Earth,
Moon, and Gateway paves the way for enabling refurbishment, servicing, and
utilization of this orbiting platform. This study is devoted to determining
two-way minimum-time low-thrust orbit transfers that connect both Earth and
Moon to Gateway. Backward time propagation is proposed as a very convenient
option for trajectories that approach and rendezvous with Gateway, and a
unified formulation is introduced for minimum-time orbit transfers, using
either forward or backward propagation. Two-way transfers between Gateway and a
specified low-altitude lunar orbit are first determined, using an indirect
heuristic method, which employs the necessary conditions for optimality and a
heuristic algorithm. Second, two-way orbit transfers that connect Earth and
Gateway are addressed. Because these trajectories exist under the influence of
two major attracting bodies, the underlying optimal control problem is
formulated as a multi-arc trajectory optimization problem, involving three
different representations for the spacecraft state. Multi-arc optimal control
problems are associated with several corner conditions to be enforced at the
junction time that separates distinct arcs. However, these conditions are shown
to be solvable sequentially for the problem at hand, leveraging implicit
costate transformation. This implies that the multi-arc problem has a set of
unknown quantities with the same size as that of a single-arc optimal control
problem, with apparent advantages of computational nature. The indirect
heuristic method is also applied in this second mission scenario.

We study the multi-height distribution of rational points of smooth,
projective and split toric varieties over $\mathbf{Q}$ using the lift of the
number of points to universal torsors.

In this paper, we address a nonconvexly constrained nonsmooth optimization
problem involving the composition of a weakly convex function and a smooth
mapping. To find a stationary point of the target problem, we propose a
variable smoothing-type algorithm by combining the ideas of (i) translating the
constrained problem into a Euclidean optimization problem with a smooth
parametrization of the constraint set; (ii) exploiting a sequence of smoothed
surrogate functions, of the cost function, given with the Moreau envelope of a
weakly convex function. The proposed algorithm produces a vector sequence by
the gradient descent update of a smoothed surrogate function at each iteration.
In a case where the proximity operator of the weakly convex function is
available, the proposed algorithm does not require any iterative solver for
subproblems therein. By leveraging tools in the variational analysis, we show
the so-called {\em gradient consistency property}, which is a key ingredient
for smoothing-type algorithms, of the smoothed surrogate function used in this
paper. Based on the gradient consistency property, we also establish an
asymptotic convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$. We
describe the full lattice of subfunctors of the diagonal $p$-permutation
functor $kR_k$ obtained by $k$-linear extension from the functor $R_k$ of
linear representations over $k$. This leads to the description of the
``composition factors'' $S_P$ of $kR_k$, which are parametrized by finite
$p$-groups (up to isomorphism), and of the evaluations of these particular
simple diagonal $p$-permutation functors over $k$.

A random planar quadrangulation process is introduced as an approximation for
certain cellular automata describing neuronal dynamics. This model turns out to
be a particular (rectangular) case of a well-known Gilbert tessellation. The
central and still open question is the distribution of the line segments. We
derive exponential bounds for the tail of this distribution. The correlations
in the model are also investigated for some instructive examples. In
particular, the exponential decay of correlations is established. If the
initial configuration of points is confined in a box $[0,N]^2$ it is proved
that the average number of rays escaping the box has a linear order in $N$.

This paper considers a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)
assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where each RIS
element can flexibly switch between the active and passive modes. Subject to
the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each
communication user (CU) and the transmit power constraints for both the base
station (BS) and the active RIS elements, with the objective of maximizing the
minimum beampattern gain among multiple targets, we jointly optimize the BS
transmit beamforming for ISAC and the mode selection of each RIS reflecting
element, as well as the RIS reflection coefficient matrix. Such formulated
joint hybrid-RIS assisted ISAC design problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear
program, which is decomposed into two low-dimensional subproblems being solved
in an alternating manner. Specifically, by using the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) technique along with the rank-one beamforming construction process, we
efficiently obtain the optimal ISAC transmit beamforming design at the BS. Via
the SDR and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, we jointly
determine the active/passive mode selection and reflection coefficient for each
RIS element. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design solution is
significantly superior to the existing baseline solutions.

A multigraph in which adjacent vertices have different degrees is called
locally irregular. The locally irregular edge coloring is an edge coloring of a
multigraph $G$ in which every color induces a locally irregular submultigraph
of $G$. We denote by $\operatorname{lir}(G)$ the locally irregular chromatic
index of a multigraph $G$, which is the smallest number of colors required in a
locally irregular edge coloring of $G$, given that such a coloring of $G$
exists. By $^2G$ we denote a 2-multigraph obtained from a simple graph $G$ by
doubling each its edge. In 2022 Grzelec and Wo\'zniak conjectured that
$\operatorname{lir}(^2G) \leq 2$ for every connected simple graph $G$ different
from $K_2$; the conjecture is known as Local Irregularity Conjecture for
2-multigraphs. In this paper, we prove this conjecture in the case of regular
graphs, split graphs, and some particular families of subcubic graphs.
Moreover, we provide a constant upper bound on the locally irregular chromatic
index of planar 2-multigraphs (except for $^2K_2$), and we obtain a better
constant upper bound on $\operatorname{lir}(^2G)$ if $G$ is a simple subcubic
graph different from $K_2$. In the proofs, special decompositions of graphs and
the relation of Local Irregularity Conjecture to the well-known 1-2-3
Conjecture are utilized.

We put forward a conjecture for the leading constant in Malle's conjecture on
number fields of bounded discriminant, guided by stacky versions of conjectures
of Batyrev-Manin, Batyrev-Tschinkel, and Peyre on rational points of bounded
height on Fano varieties. A new framework for Brauer groups of stacks plays a
key role in our conjecture, and we define a new notion of the unramified Brauer
group of an algebraic stack.

We introduce the notion of a partial Betti splitting of a homogeneous ideal,
generalizing the notion of a Betti splitting first given by Francisco, H\`a,
and Van Tuyl. Given a homogeneous ideal $I$ and two ideals $J$ and $K$ such
that $I = J+K$, a partial Betti splitting of $I$ relates some of the graded
Betti of $I$ with those of $J, K$, and $J\cap K$. As an application, we focus
on the partial Betti splittings of binomial edge ideals. Using this new
technique, we generalize results of Saeedi Madani and Kiani related to binomial
edge ideals with cut edges, we describe a partial Betti splitting for all
binomial edge ideals, and we compute the total second Betti number of binomial
edge ideals of trees.

Multilayer networks provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems
that capture different types of interactions between the same set of entities
across multiple layers. Core-periphery detection involves partitioning the
nodes of a network into core nodes, which are highly connected across the
network, and peripheral nodes, which are densely connected to the core but
sparsely connected among themselves. In this paper, we propose a new model of
core-periphery in multilayer network and a nonlinear spectral method that
simultaneously detects the corresponding core and periphery structures of both
nodes and layers in weighted and directed multilayer networks. Our method
reveals novel structural insights in three empirical multilayer networks from
distinct application areas: the citation network of complex network scientists,
the European airlines transport network, and the world trade network.

The main purpose of this paper is to present the generalization of the
inequalities between the modulus of the polar derivative and the polynomial
itself, depending on consideration of the zeros inside and outside of a closed
disk and the extremal coefficient position of the underlying polynomial.

We construct a graded cluster algebra structure on the Cox ring of a smooth
complex variety $Z$, depending on a base cluster structure on the ring of
regular functions of an open subset $Y$ of $Z$. After considering some
elementary examples of our construction, including toric varieties, we discuss
the two main applications. First: if $Z$ is a flag variety and $Y$ is the open
Schubert cell, we prove that our results recover, by geometric methods, a well
known construction of Geiss, Leclerc and Schr\"oer. Second: we define the
diagonal partial compactification of a (finite type) cluster variety, and prove
that its Cox ring is a graded upper cluster algebra. Along the way, we explain
how similar constructions can be done if we replace the Cox ring with a ring of
global sections of a sheaf of divisorial algebras on $Z$.

Hadwiger's conjecture for the immersion relation posits that every graph $G$
contains an immersion of the complete graph $K_{\chi(G)}$. Vergara showed that
this is equivalent to saying that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)=2$
contains an immersion of the complete graph on $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$
vertices. Recently, Botler et al. showed that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with
$\alpha(G)=2$ contains every complete bipartite graph on
$\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ vertices as an immersion. In this paper, we give a
much simpler proof of this result.

Neurons depend on two interdependent mechanisms-homeostasis and
neuromodulation-to maintain robust and adaptable functionality. Homeostasis
stabilizes neuronal activity by adjusting ionic conductances, whereas
neuromodulation dynamically modifies ionic properties in response to external
signals. Combining these mechanisms in conductance-based models often produces
unreliable outcomes, particularly when sharp neuromodulation interferes with
homeostatic tuning. This study explores how a biologically inspired
neuromodulation controller can harmonize with homeostasis to ensure reliable
neuronal function. Using computational models of stomatogastric ganglion and
dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that controlled neuromodulation preserves
neuronal firing patterns while maintaining intracellular calcium levels. Unlike
sharp neuromodulation, the neuromodulation controller integrates
activity-dependent feedback through mechanisms mimicking G-protein-coupled
receptor cascades. The interaction between these controllers critically depends
on the existence of an intersection in conductance space, representing a
balance between target calcium levels and neuromodulated firing patterns.
Maximizing neuronal degeneracy enhances the likelihood of such intersections,
enabling robust modulation and compensation for channel blockades. We further
show that this controller pairing extends to network-level activity, reliably
modulating central pattern generators in crustaceans. These findings suggest
that targeting neuromodulation pathways-rather than ion channels directly-may
offer safer pharmacological strategies to manage neuronal dysfunctions. This
study highlights the complementary roles of homeostasis and neuromodulation,
proposing a unified control framework for maintaining robust and adaptive
neural activity under physiological and pathological conditions.

For a tree $T$ and a function $f \colon E(T)\to \mathbb{S}^d$, the imbalance
of a subtree $T'\subseteq T$ is given by $|\sum_{e \in E(T')} f(e)|$. The
$d$-dimensional discrepancy of the tree $T$ is the minimum, over all functions
$f$ as above, of the maximum imbalance of a subtree of $T$. We prove tight
asymptotic bounds for the discrepancy of a tree $T$, confirming a conjecture of
Krishna, Michaeli, Sarantis, Wang and Wang. We also settle a related conjecture
on oriented discrepancy of subtrees by the same authors.

This article introduces the study of toric bundles and the morphisms between
them from the perspective of adelic fibre bundles, as introduced by
Chambert-Loir and Tschinkel. We study the Okounkov bodies and Boucksom-Chen
transforms of suitable adelic line bundles on toric bundles. Finally, we prove
an arithmetic analogue of a formula for intersection numbers due to Hofscheier,
Khovanskii and Monin. We apply this to the study of compactifications of
semiabelian varieties, whose height and successive minima we compute. This
extends computations of Chambert-Loir to arbitrary toric compactifications.

Advanced classification algorithms are being increasingly used in
safety-critical applications like health-care, engineering, etc. In such
applications, miss-classifications made by ML algorithms can result in
substantial financial or health-related losses. To better anticipate and
prepare for such losses, the algorithm user seeks an estimate for the
probability that the algorithm miss-classifies a sample. We refer to this task
as the risk-assessment. For a variety of models and datasets, we numerically
analyze the performance of different methods in solving the risk-assessment
problem. We consider two solution strategies: a) calibration techniques that
calibrate the output probabilities of classification models to provide accurate
probability outputs; and b) a novel approach based upon the prediction interval
generation technique of conformal prediction. Our conformal prediction based
approach is model and data-distribution agnostic, simple to implement, and
provides reasonable results for a variety of use-cases. We compare the
different methods on a broad variety of models and datasets.

Given an unknown $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued function $f$ on a metric space $X$,
can we approximate the persistent homology of $f$ from a finite sampling of $X$
with known pairwise distances and function values? This question has been
answered in the case $n=1$, assuming $f$ is Lipschitz continuous and $X$ is a
sufficiently regular geodesic metric space, and using filtered geometric
complexes with fixed scale parameter for the approximation. In this paper we
answer the question for arbitrary $n$, under similar assumptions and using
function-geometric multifiltrations. Our analysis offers a different view on
these multifiltrations by focusing on their approximation properties rather
than on their stability properties. We also leverage the multiparameter setting
to provide insight into the influence of the scale parameter, whose choice is
central to this type of approach.

We study geometrically constrained magnetic walls in a three dimensional
geometry where two bulks are connected by a thin neck. Without imposing any
symmetry assumption on the domain, we investigate the scaling of the energy as
the size of the neck vanishes. We identify five significant scaling regimes,
for all of which we characterize the energy scaling; in some cases, we are also
able to identify the asymptotic behavior of the domain wall. Finally, we notice
the emergence of sub-regimes that are not present int previous works due to
restrictive symmetry assumptions.

We consider the problem of least squares parameter estimation from
single-trajectory data for discrete-time, unstable, closed-loop nonlinear
stochastic systems, with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming a region
of the state space produces informative data, and the system is
sub-exponentially unstable, we establish non-asymptotic guarantees on the
estimation error at times where the state trajectory evolves in this region. If
the whole state space is informative, high probability guarantees on the error
hold for all times. Examples are provided where our results are useful for
analysis, but existing results are not.

In an influential article Papadimitriou [FOCS 1991] proved that a local
search algorithm called WalkSAT finds a satisfying assignment of a satisfiable
2-CNF with $n$ variables in $O(n^2)$ expected time. Variants of the WalkSAT
algorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (e.g., [Hoos and
St\"utzle 2000]). In the present article we analyse the expected running time
of WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances. Answering a question raised by
Alekhnovich and Ben-Sasson [SICOMP 2007], we show that WalkSAT runs in linear
expected time for all clause/variable densities up to the random 2-SAT
satisfiability threshold.

In this paper, stability and sensitivity properties of a class of parametric
constrained optimization problem, whose feasible region is defined by a
set-valued inclusion, are investigated through the associated optimal value
function. Set-valued inclusions are a kind of constraint system, which
naturally emerges in contexts requiring the robust fulfilment of traditional
cone constraints, where data are affected by uncertain elements having a non
stochastic nature, or in (MPEC) as a vector equilibrium constraint, where
feasible solutions are intended as equilibrium point in a strong sense. Under
proper convexity assumptions on the objective function and the constraining
set-valued term, combined with a global qualification condition, a class of
parametric optimization problems is singled out, which displays a global
Lipschitz behaviour. By employing recent results of variational analysis,
elements for a sensitivity analysis of this class of problems are provided via
exact subgradient formulae for the optimal value function. Further consequences
of the stability behaviour are explored in terms of problem calmness and
viability of penalization techniques.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of
robotics applications, where it outperforms classical methods. However, the
safety aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open
challenge. A prominent field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the
safety of the agents during training and execution is safe reinforcement
learning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained RL and safe exploration
approaches. The former learns the safety constraints over the course of
training to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the cost of high
number of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter offers
robust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which
prevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in
lower rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a
novel safety shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based
controllers with the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing
the RL agent to adaptively tune the parameters of the controller. Our approach
is able to improve the exploration of the RL agents for navigation tasks, while
minimizing the number of collisions. Experiments in simulation show that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the reached
goals-to-collisions ratio in different challenging environments. The
goals-to-collisions ratio metrics emphasizes the importance of minimizing the
number of collisions, while learning to accomplish the task. Our approach
achieves a higher number of reached goals compared to the classic safety
shields and fewer collisions compared to constrained RL approaches. Finally, we
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in a real-world experiment.

We relate rational integrals of the geodesic flow of a (pseudo-)Riemannian
metric to relative Killig tensors, describe the spaces they span and discuss
upper bounds on their dimensions.

This paper investigates the construction and analysis of permutation codes
under the Chebyshev distance. The direct product group permutation (DPGP)
codes, introduced independently by Kl\o ve et al. and Tamo et al., represent
the best-known permutation codes in terms of both size and minimum distance.
These codes possess algebraic structures that facilitate efficient encoding and
decoding algorithms. In particular, this study focuses on recursively extended
permutation (REP) codes, which were also introduced by Kl\o ve et al. We
examine the properties of REP codes and prove that, in terms of size and
minimum distance, the optimal REP code is equivalent to the DPGP codes.
Furthermore, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP
codes.

We prove a robust contraction decomposition theorem for $H$-minor-free
graphs, which states that given an $H$-minor-free graph $G$ and an integer $p$,
one can partition in polynomial time the vertices of $G$ into $p$ sets
$Z_1,\dots,Z_p$ such that $\operatorname{tw}(G/(Z_i \setminus Z')) = O(p +
|Z'|)$ for all $i \in [p]$ and $Z' \subseteq Z_i$. Here,
$\operatorname{tw}(\cdot)$ denotes the treewidth of a graph and $G/(Z_i
\setminus Z')$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all edges
with both endpoints in $Z_i \setminus Z'$.
  Our result generalizes earlier results by Klein [SICOMP 2008] and Demaine et
al. [STOC 2011] based on partitioning $E(G)$, and some recent theorems for
planar graphs by Marx et al. [SODA 2022], for bounded-genus graphs (more
generally, almost-embeddable graphs) by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SODA 2022], and
for unit-disk graphs by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SoCG 2022].
  The robust contraction decomposition theorem directly results in
parameterized algorithms with running time $2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k})} \cdot
n^{O(1)}$ or $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ for every vertex/edge deletion problems on
$H$-minor-free graphs that can be formulated as Permutation CSP Deletion or
2-Conn Permutation CSP Deletion. Consequently, we obtain the first
subexponential-time parameterized algorithms for Subset Feedback Vertex Set,
Subset Odd Cycle Transversal, Subset Group Feedback Vertex Set, 2-Conn
Component Order Connectivity on $H$-minor-free graphs. For other problems which
already have subexponential-time parameterized algorithms on $H$-minor-free
graphs (e.g., Odd Cycle Transversal, Vertex Multiway Cut, Vertex Multicut,
etc.), our theorem gives much simpler algorithms of the same running time.

Pin sequences play an important role in the structural study of permutation
classes. In this paper, we study the permutation classes that comprise all the
finite subpermutations contained in an infinite pin sequence. We prove that
these permutation classes have proper growth rates and establish a procedure
for calculating these growth rates.

Generalizing work by Belk and Forrest, we develop almost expanding hyperedge
replacement systems that build fractal topological spaces as quotients of edge
shifts under certain ``gluing'' equivalent relations. We define ESS groups,
which are groups of homeomorphisms of these spaces that act as a finitary
asynchronous transformations followed by self-similar ones, akin to the action
of Scott-R\"{o}ver-Nekrashevych groups on the Cantor space. We provide
sufficient conditions for finiteness properties of such groups, which allow us
to show that the airplane and dendrite rearrangement groups have type
$F_\infty$, that a group combining dendrite rearrangements and the Grigorchuk
group is finitely generated, and that certain ESS groups of edge shifts have
type $F_\infty$ (partially addressing a question of Deaconu), in addition to
providing new proofs of previously known results about several Thompson-like
groups.

We establish a duality between a pair of mirabolic quantum groups, i.e., the
mirabolic counterpart of quantum Howe duality.

When deploying autonomous systems in unknown and changing environments, it is
critical that their motion planning and control algorithms are computationally
efficient and can be reapplied online in real time, whilst providing
theoretical safety guarantees in the presence of disturbances. The satisfaction
of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying
dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop
methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an
offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track
a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online,
accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is
designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second
method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We
simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle
subject to wave disturbances.

In this work, we extend the concept of Robinson spaces to asymmetric
dissimilarities, enhancing their applicability in representing and analyzing
complex data. Within this generalized framework, we introduce two different
problems that extend the classical seriation problem: an optimization problem
and a decision problem. We establish that these problems are NP-hard and
NP-complete, respectively. Despite this complexity results, we identify several
non-trivial instances where these problems can be solved in polynomial time,
providing valuable insights into their tractability.

We study the homotopy theory of polyhedral products associated to a
combinatorial generalisation of manifolds known as pseudomanifolds. As special
cases, we show that loop spaces of moment-angle manifolds associated to
triangulations of $S^2$ and $S^3$ decompose as a product of spheres and loops
on spheres.

In this paper we examine the topology of Brill-Noether varieties associated
to real trigonal curves. More precisely, we aim to count the connected
components of the real locus of the varieties parametrizing linear systems of
degree $d$ and dimension at least $r$. We do this count when the relations
$m=g-d+r-1\leq d-2r-1$ are satisfied, where $m$ is the Maroni invariant and $g$
is the genus of the curve.

In this letter, we derive the sharp-interface limit of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot
equations using formal matched asymptotic expansions. We find that in each
sub-domain, the quasi-static Biot equations are obtained with domain-specific
material parameters. Moreover, across the interface, material displacement and
pore pressure are continuous, while volumetric fluid content and normal stress
are balanced. By utilizing the energy of the system, the phase-field potential
is shown to be influenced by the curvature, along with contributions from both
flow and elasticity at the interface. The normal velocity of the interface is
proportional to the jump in normal derivative of the phase-field potential
across the interface. Finally, we present a numerical experiment that
demonstrates how the location of each phase evolves consistently as the
diffuse-interface width parameter becomes smaller; only the width of the
diffuse interface changes.

Ohno-Wakabayashi's cyclic sum formula for multiple zeta-star values is
generalized by Igarashi with one or two parameters. In this article, we give a
possible answer for one of his problems about a generalization with three
parameters.

By analytically solving the quantum Rabi model, we investigate the photonic
properties of its ground eigenstate. In particular, we find that in the deep
strong coupling regime, where the coupling strength $g$ exceeds the mode
frequency $\omega$, the photonic state is effectively squeezed in one of its
quadratures. The squeezing reaches its maximum at the curve corresponding to
the quantum phase transition of the quantum Rabi system, and decreases rapidly
on both sides of the phase transition. Notably, for $g/\omega\approx 3$, which
is experimentally testable in existing trapped-ion platforms, the achievable
squeezing parameter can reach approximately $r\approx 0.8$. Intriguingly, the
photonic state is squeezed while its number distribution follows a
super-Poissonian distribution, with the largest deviation from Poissonian
behavior occurring at the phase transition between the normal and superradiant
phases. In other words, the ground state of the quantum Rabi model contains
super-Poissonian quantum squeezed photons.

We prove that fractional Helly and $(p,q)$-theorems imply
$(\aleph_0,q)$-theorems in an entirely abstract setting. We give a plethora of
applications, including reproving almost all earlier $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorems
about geometric hypergraphs that were proved recently. Some of the corollaries
are new results, for example, we prove that if $\mathcal{F}$ is an infinite
family of convex compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and among every $\aleph_0$ of
the sets some $d+1$ contain a point in their intersection with integer
coordinates, then all the members of $\mathcal{F}$ can be hit with finitely
many points with integer coordinates.

Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\ge 2$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain
with outer unit normal $\nu$. For $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ let $R_\Omega^\alpha$
be the Laplacian in $\Omega$ with the Robin boundary condition $\partial_\nu
u+\alpha u=0$, and denote by $E(R^\alpha_\Omega)$ its principal eigenvalue. In
2017 Bucur, Freitas and Kennedy stated the following open question: Does the
limit of the ratio $E(R_\Omega^\alpha)/ \alpha^2$ for $\alpha\to-\infty$ always
exist? We give a negative answer.

In this paper, we study a problem of mass partitions by parallel hyperplanes.
Takahashi and Sober\'on conjectured an extension of the classical ham sandwich
theorem: any $d+k-1$ measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be simultaneously
equipartitioned by $k$ parallel hyperplanes. We construct a configuration space
-- test map scheme and prove a new Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem to show that the
conjecture is true in the case when the Stirling number of second kind
$S(d+k-1, k)$ is odd. This recovers exactly the parity condition obtained by
Hubard and Sober\'on via different methods, reinforcing the possibility that
this condition is both necessary and sufficient. Our proof relies on a novel
computation of the Fadell-Husseini index.

In 2007, Ye \& Zhang introduced a version of local topological entropy. Since
their entropy function is, as we show under mild conditions, constant for
topologically transitive dynamical systems, we propose to adjust the notion in
a way that doesn't neglect the initial transient part of an orbit.
  We investigate the properties of this ``transient'' local entropy and compute
it in terms of Lyapunov exponents for various dynamical systems.
  We also investigate how this adjustment affects measure-theoretic local
(Brin-Katok) entropy.

This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of solutions to $u_t=\Delta
u+|u|^{p-1}u$ in the Sobolev critical case.
  Our main result is a classification of the dynamics near the ground states in
the six dimensional case.
  It is shown that solutions starting near the ground states fall into one of
the following three scenarios:
  - They are globally defined and converge to one of the ground states as
$t\to\infty$.
  - They are globally defined and converge to $0$ in $\dot H^1(\mathbb{R}^6)$
as $t\to\infty$.
  - They exhibit finite time blowup with a type I rate.
  This paper extends the classification result in the case $n\geq7$, previously
obtained by Collot-Merle-Rapha\"el, to the borderline case $n=6$.

Sparse parametric models are of great interest in statistical learning and
are often analyzed by means of regularized estimators. Pathwise methods allow
to efficiently compute the full solution path for penalized estimators, for any
possible value of the penalization parameter $\lambda$. In this paper we deal
with the pathwise optimization for bridge-type problems; i.e. we are interested
in the minimization of a loss function, such as negative log-likelihood or
residual sum of squares, plus the sum of $\ell^q$ norms with $q\in(0,1]$
involving adpative coefficients. For some loss functions this regularization
achieves asymptotically the oracle properties (such as the selection
consistency). Nevertheless, since the objective function involves nonconvex and
nondifferentiable terms, the minimization problem is computationally
challenging.
  The aim of this paper is to apply some general algorithms, arising from
nonconvex optimization theory, to compute efficiently the path solutions for
the adaptive bridge estimator with multiple penalties. In particular, we take
into account two different approaches: accelerated proximal gradient descent
and blockwise alternating optimization. The convergence and the path
consistency of these algorithms are discussed. In order to assess our methods,
we apply these algorithms to the penalized estimation of diffusion processes
observed at discrete times. This latter represents a recent research topic in
the field of statistics for time-dependent data.

We propose a mathematical model for tumor invasion supported by angiogenesis
and interactions with the surrounding tissue. For the model deduction we employ
a multiscale approach starting from lower scales and obtaining by an informal
parabolic upscaling a system of reaction-diffusion-taxis equations with a
so-called 'taxis cascade', where one species is performing taxis towards a
signal whose production/decay is controled by the other, for which it also
serves as a tactic cue. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions
to the obtained PDE-ODE system and perform numerical simulations to illustrate
the behavior of solutions.

We compute the mixing time of the Facilitated Exclusion Process (FEP) and
obtain cutoff and pre-cutoff in different regimes. The main tool to obtain this
result is a new bijective, deterministic mapping between the joint law of an
ergodic FEP and its current through the origin, and the joint law of a SSEP and
its current through the origin. This mapping is interesting in itself, as it
remains valid in the non-ergodic regime where it gives a coupling between the
position of a tagged particle in the FEP and the current through the origin in
a SSEP with traps.

We interpret the coupled Ding semistability and the reduced coupled uniform
Ding stability of log Fano pairs in the notion of coupled stability thresholds
and reduced coupled stability thresholds. As a corollary, we solve a modified
version of the conjecture by Hultgren and Witt Nystr\"om for coupled
K\"ahler--Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds.

$2\times2$ matrix polynomials of the form $P_{n}(z)=
\Sigma^{n}_{j=0}\,\sigma_{j}\,z^{j}$, for the cases $n=1,2,3$ are constructed,
and the nature of PT-symmetry is examined across different points $z=(x,y)$ in
the complex plane. The PT-symmetric properties of $P_{n}(z)$ can be
characterized by two functions, denoted by $s(x,y)$ and $h(x,y)$. If the trace
of the matrix polynomial is real, then the points at which it can exhibit
PT-symmetry are defined by the family of curves $s(x,y)=0$. Additionally, at
points where the function $h(x,y)\geq 0$, the matrix polynomial exhibits
unbroken PT-symmetry; otherwise, it exhibits broken PT-symmetry. The
intersection points of the curves $s(x,y)=0$ and $h(x,y)=k$, for a given $k\in
\mathbb{R}$, are shown to lie on an ellipse, hyperbola, two lines passing
through the origin, or a straight line, depending on the nature of PT-symmetry
of the matrix polynomial. The PT-symmetric behaviour of $P_{n}(z)$ at the zeros
of the matrix polynomial is also studied.

In this paper, we see several basic properties of graded linear series. We
firstly see that, if a graded linear series contains an ample series, then so
are the pullbacks of the system under birational morphisms. Using this
proposition, we define the refinements of graded linear series with respects to
primitive flags. Moreover, we give several formulas to compute the
$S$-invariant of those refinements. Secondly, we introduce the notion of
coupled stability thresholds for graded linear series, which is a
generalization of the notion introduced by Rubinstein--Tian--Zhang. We see
that, over the interior of the support for finite numbers of graded linear
series containing an ample series, the coupled stability threshold function can
be uniquely extended continuously, which generalizes the work by Kewei Zhang.
Thirdly, we get a product-type formula for coupled stability thresholds, which
generalizes the work of Zhuang. Fourthly, we see Abban--Zhuang's type formulas
for estimating local coupled stability thresholds.

In this article, we find a scaling limit of the space-time mass fluctuation
field of Glauber + Kawasaki particle dynamics around its hydrodynamic mean
curvature interface limit. Here, the Glauber rates are scaled by $K=K_N$, the
Kawasaki rates by $N^2$ and space by $1/N$. We start the process so that the
interface $\Gamma_t$ formed is stationary that is, $\Gamma_t$ is `flat'. When
the Glauber rates are balanced on $T^d$, $\Gamma_t=\Gamma=\{x: x_1=0\}$ is
immobile and the hydrodynamic limit is given by $\rho(t,v) = \rho_+$ for
$v_1\in (0,1/2)$ and $\rho(t,v)= \rho_-$ for $v_1\in (-1/2,0)$ for all $t\ge
0$, where $v=(v_1,\ldots,v_d)\in T^d$ identified with $[-1/2,1/2)^d$. Since in
the formation the boundary region about the interface has width
$O(1/\sqrt{K_N})$, we will scale the $v_1$ coordinate in the fluctuation field
by $\sqrt{K_N}$ so that the scaling limit will capture information `near' the
interface.
  We identify the fluctuation limit as a Gaussian field when $K_N\uparrow
\infty$ and $K_N= O(\sqrt{\log(N)})$ in $d\leq 2$. In the one dimensional case,
the field limit is given by ${\bf e}(v_1) B_t$ where $B_t$ is a Brownian motion
and ${\bf e}$ is the normalized derivative of a decreasing `standing wave'
solution $\phi$ of $\partial^2_{v_1} \phi - V'(\phi)=0$ on $R$, where $V'$ is
the homogenization of the Glauber rates. In two dimensions, the limit is ${\bf
e}(v_1)Z_t(v_2)$ where $Z_t$ is the solution of a one dimensional stochastic
heat equation. The appearance of the function ${\bf e}(\cdot)$ in the limit
field indicates that the interface fluctuation retains the shape of the
transition layer $\phi$.

We present a Fourier-analytic method for estimating convergence rates in
total variation distance in terms of various metrics related to weak
convergence. Applications are provided in the areas of Malliavin calculus,
normal approximation and stochastic dynamical systems with memory.

Propositional dynamic logic (PDL) is an important modal logic used to specify
and reason about the behavior of software. A challenging problem in the context
of PDL is solving fixed-point equations, i.e., formulae of the form $x \equiv
\phi(x)$ such that $x$ is a propositional variable and $\phi(x)$ is a formula
containing $x$. A solution to such an equation is a formula $\psi$ that omits
$x$ and satisfies $\psi \equiv \phi(\psi)$, where $\phi(\psi)$ is obtained by
replacing all occurrences of $x$ with $\psi$ in $\phi(x)$. In this paper, we
identify a novel class of PDL formulae arranged in two dual hierarchies for
which every fixed-point equation $x \equiv \phi(x)$ has a solution. Moreover,
we not only prove the existence of solutions for all such equations, but also
provide an explicit solution $\psi$ for each fixed-point equation.

We study the relationship between certain SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ processes, which
are variants of the Schramm-Loewner evolution with parameter $\kappa$ in which
one keeps track of an extra marked point, and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG).
These processes are defined whenever $\rho > -2-\kappa/2$ and in this work we
will focus on the light cone regime, meaning that $\kappa \in (0,4)$ and
$\max(\kappa/2-4,-2-\kappa/2) < \rho < -2$. Such processes are
self-intersecting even though ordinary SLE$_\kappa$ curves are simple for
$\kappa \in (0,4)$. We show that such a process drawn on top of an independent
$\sqrt{\kappa}$-LQG surface called a weight $(\rho+4)$-quantum wedge can be
represented as a gluing of a pair of trees which are described by the two
coordinate functions of a correlated $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process with
$\alpha = 1-2(\rho+2)/\kappa$. Combined with another work, this shows that
bipolar oriented random planar maps with large faces can be identified in the
scaling limit with an SLE$_\kappa(\kappa-4)$ curve on an independent
$\sqrt{\kappa}$-LQG surface for $\kappa \in (4/3,2)$.

Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC)
systems have shown notable improvements in efficiency, such as reduced latency,
higher data rates, and better energy efficiency. However, the resource
competition among users will lead to uneven allocation, increased latency, and
lower throughput. Fortunately, the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)
technique has emerged as a promising solution for managing interference and
optimizing resource allocation in MEC systems. This paper studies an
IRS-assisted MEC system with RSMA, aiming to jointly optimize the passive
beamforming of the IRS, the active beamforming of the base station, the task
offloading allocation, the transmit power of users, the ratios of public and
private information allocation, and the decoding order of the RSMA to minimize
the average delay from a novel uplink transmission perspective. Since the
formulated problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are highly
coupled, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm
to optimize both continuous and discrete variables of the problem.
Additionally, to better extract channel features, we design a novel network
architecture within the policy and evaluation networks of the proposed
algorithm, combining convolutional neural networks and densely connected
convolutional network for feature extraction. Simulation results indicate that
the proposed algorithm not only exhibits excellent convergence performance but
also outperforms various benchmarks.

Let $T\colon M_n\rightarrow M_n$ preserve Hadamard circulant majorization. In
this note, we show that this property is inherited by the three most popular
generalized inverses, viz. the Moore-Penrose inverse, the group inverse and the
Drazin inverse.

This paper establishes the convergence of boundary-layer solutions of the
consumption type Keller-Segel model with non-degenerate initial data subject to
physical boundary conditions, which is a sequel of
\cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing} on the case of degenerate initial data.
Specifically, we justify that the solution with positive chemical diffusion
rate $\varepsilon>0 $ converges to the solution with zero diffusion
$\varepsilon=0 $ (outer-layer solution) plus the boundary-layer profiles
(inner-layer solution) for any time $t>0$ as $ \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 $.
Compared to \cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing}, the main difficulty in the
analysis is the lack of regularity of the outer- and boundary-layer profiles
since only the zero-order compatibility conditions for the leading-order
boundary-layer profiles can be fulfilled with non-degenerate initial data. Our
new strategy is to regularize the boundary-layer profiles with carefully
designed corner-corrector functions and approximate the low-regularity
leading-order boundary-layer profiles by higher-regularity profiles with
regularized boundary conditions. By using delicate weight functions involving
boundary-layer profiles to cancel the multi-scaled linear terms in the
perturbed equations, we manage to obtain the requisite uniform-in-$ \varepsilon
$ estimates for the convergence analysis. This cancellation technique enables
us to prove the convergence to boundary-layer solutions for any time $ t >0 $,
which is different from the convergence result in
\cite{Corrillo-Hong-Wang-vanishing} which holds true only for some finite time
depending on the Dirichlet boundary value.

We study the isoperimetric problem with a potential energy $g$ in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ weighted by a radial density $f$ and analyze the geometric
properties of minimizers. Notably, we construct two counterexamples
demonstrating that, in contrast to the classical isoperimetric case $g = 0$,
the condition $\ln(f)'' + g' \geq 0$ does not generally guarantee the global
optimality of centered spheres. However, we demonstrate that centered spheres
are globally optimal when both $f$ and $g$ are monotone. Additionally, we
strengthen this result by deriving a sharp quantitative stability inequality.

In combinatorial game theory, there are two famous winning conventions,
normal play and mis\`ere play. Under normal play convention, the winner is the
player who moves last and under mis\`ere play convention, the loser is the
player who moves last. The difference makes these conventions completely
different, and usually, games under mis\`ere play convention is much difficult
to analyze than games under normal play convention. In this study, we show an
interesting relationship between rulesets under different winning conventions;
we can determine the winner of two-player GOISHI HIROI under normal play
convention by using NIM under mis\`ere play convention. We also analyze
two-player GOISHI HIROI under mis\`ere play convention.

Under a set of assumptions on a family of submanifolds $\subset {\mathbb
R}^D$, we derive a series of geometric properties that remain valid after
finite-dimensional and almost isometric Diffusion Maps (DM), including almost
uniform density, finite polynomial approximation and local reach. Leveraging
these properties, we establish rigorous bounds on the embedding errors
introduced by the DM algorithm is $O\left((\frac{\log
n}{n})^{\frac{1}{8d+16}}\right)$. These results offer a solid theoretical
foundation for understanding the performance and reliability of DM in practical
applications.

This paper studies online convex optimization with unknown linear budget
constraints, where only the gradient information of the objective and the
bandit feedback of constraint functions are observed. We propose a safe and
efficient Lyapunov-optimization algorithm (SELO) that can achieve an
$O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero cumulative constraint violation. The result also
implies SELO achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret when the budget is hard and not
allowed to be violated. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient as
it resembles a primal-dual algorithm where the primal problem is an
unconstrained, strongly convex and smooth problem, and the dual problem has a
simple gradient-type update. The algorithm and theory are further justified in
a simulated application of energy-efficient task processing in distributed data
centers.

Inspired by Gansner's elegant $k$-trace generating function for rectangular
plane partitions, we introduce two novel operators, $\varphi_{z}$ and
$\psi_{z}$, along with their combinatorial interpretations. Through these
operators, we derive a new formula for $P$-partitions of posets extended by
two-rowed plane partitions. This formula allows us to compute explicit
enumerative generating functions for various classes of $P$-partitions. Our
findings encompass skew plane partitions, diamond-related two-rowed plane
partitions, an extended $V$-poset, and ladder poset extensions, enriching the
theory of $P$-partitions.

In the paper, we describe $n$-dimensional naturally graded nilpotent
associative algebras with the characteristic sequence
$C(\mathcal{A})=(n-p,1,\dots,1)$ as called $p-$filiform algebras over the field
of the complex numbers.

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide significant
enhancements in performance and resource efficiency compared to individual
sensing and communication systems, primarily attributed to the collaborative
use of wireless resources, radio waveforms, and hardware platforms. The
performance limits of a system are crucial for guiding its design; however, the
performance limits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems
remain an open question. This paper focuses on the bistatic ISAC systems with
dispersed multi-receivers and one sensor. Compared to the monostatic ISAC
systems, the main challenge is that that the communication messages are unknown
to the sensor and thus become its interference, while the channel information
between the transmitters and the sensor is unknown to the transmitters. In
order to mitigate the interference at the sensor while maximizing the
communication degree of freedom, we introduce the blind interference alignment
strategy for various bistatic ISAC settings, including interference channels,
MU-MISO channels, and MU-MIMO channels. Under each of such system, the achieved
ISAC tradeoff points by the proposed schemes in terms of communication and
sensing degrees of freedom are characterized, which outperforms the
time-sharing between the two extreme sensing-optimal and communication-optimal
points.Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed schemes
significantly improve on the ISAC performance compared to treating interference
as noise at the sensor.

Let ${{\bf R}_{\mathbb S^{d-1}}}(p\to q)$ denote the best constant for the
$L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)\to L^q(\mathbb S^{d-1})$ Fourier restriction inequality to
the unit sphere $\mathbb S^{d-1}$, and let ${\bf R}_{\mathbb S^{d-1}} (p\to
q;\textrm{rad})$ denote the corresponding constant for radial functions. We
investigate the asymptotic behavior of the operator norms ${{\bf R}_{\mathbb
S^{d-1}}}(p\to q)$ and ${\bf R}_{\mathbb S^{d-1}} (p\to q;\textrm{rad})$ as the
dimension $d$ tends to infinity. We further establish a dimension-free endpoint
Stein-Tomas inequality for radial functions, together with the corresponding
estimate for general functions which we prove with an $O(d^{1/2})$ dependence.
Our methods rely on a uniform two-sided refinement of Stempak's asymptotic
$L^p$ estimate of Bessel functions.

The rotary and movable antennas (ROMA) technology is efficient in enhancing
wireless network capacity by adjusting both the antenna spacing and
three-dimensional (3D) rotation of antenna surfaces, based on the spatial
distribution of users and channel statistics. Applying ROMA to high-speed rail
(HSR) wireless communications can significantly improve system performance in
terms of array gain and spatial multiplexing. However, the rapidly changing
channel conditions in HSR scenarios present challenges for ROMA configuration.
In this correspondence, we propose a analytical framework for configuring
ROMA-based extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
system in HSR scenarios based on spatial correlation. First, we develop a
localization model based on a mobility-aware near-field beam training algorithm
to determine the real-time position of the train relay antennas. Next, we
derive the expression for channel orthogonality and antenna spacing based on
the spatial correlation matrix, and obtain the optimal antenna spacing when the
transceiver panels are aligned in parallel. Moreover, we propose an
optimization algorithm for the rotation angle of the transceiver panels,
leveraging the differential evolution method, to determine the optimal angle.
Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the computational results
and optimization algorithm.

In the fields of non-commutative geometry and string theory, quantum tori
appear in different mathematical and physical contexts. Therefore, quantized
theta functions defined on quantum tori are also studied (Yu. I. Manin, A.
Schwartz; note that a comparison between the two definitions of quantum theta
is still an open problem). One important application of classical theta
functions is in soliton theory. Certain soliton equations, including the KdV
equation, have algebro-geometric solutions that are given by theta functions
(we refer to F. Gesztesy and H. Holden), and as such belong to an "integrable
hierarchy." While quantized integrability is a very active and complicated
subject, in this work we take a different, naive approach. We conduct an
experiment: using a definition of differentiation on quantum tori (M. Rieffel),
we ask whether the quantum theta function satisfies non-linear PDE. The
experiment is successful on the 2-torus and for the KdV equation. This opens
the way to future investigations, such as the quest for a compatible hierarchy
satisfied by quantum theta, and a consistent definition of complete
integrability.

Accurate extraction of multicomponent linear frequency modulation (LFM)
signal parameters, such as onset frequency, linear modulation frequency,
amplitude, and initial phase, is of great importance in the fields of ISAR,
cognitive radio, electronic countermeasures, and star-ground communications.
However, the task of accurately extracting the characteristic parameters of a
signal is challenging when it has an extraordinarily large bandwidth as well as
cross or neighboring components in the time-frequency domain. In this paper, we
first review the main current methods used for multicomponent LFM signal
decomposition and their challenges, and then propose a novel multi-parameter
feature parameter extraction algorithm. The algorithmrealizes the direct and
accurate extraction of thefeature parameters of multicomponent LFM signals at
ultra-low sub-Nyquist sampling rate for the first time. Moreover, the algorithm
is optimized for the computational complexity and anti-noise problems in
practical applications, so that it has high accuracy, high efficiency and good
noise robustness. We also compare the algorithm with innovative and existing
methods, and the results show that the algorithm has excellent performance in
feature parameter extraction accuracy, noise immunity and computational speed.

Stochastic resetting has shown promise in enhancing the stability of
dynamical systems. Here, we apply this concept to theta neuron networks with
partial resetting, where only a fraction of neurons is intermittently reset. We
examine both infinite and finite reset rates, using the averaged firing rate as
an indicator of network stability. At infinite reset rates, a high proportion
of resetting neurons drives the network to stable rest or spiking states,
collapsing the bistable region at the Cusp bifurcation and producing smooth
transitions. Finite resetting introduces stochastic fluctuations, leading to
complex dynamics that sometimes deviate from theoretical predictions. These
insights highlight the role of partial resetting in stabilizing neural
dynamics, with applications in biological systems and neuromorphic computing.

The concept of matchings originated in group theory to address a linear
algebra problem related to canonical forms for symmetric tensors. In an abelian
group $(G,+)$, a matching is a bijection $f: A \to B$ between two finite
subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$ such that $a + f(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. A
group $G$ has the matching property if, for every two finite subsets $A, B
\subset G$ of the same size with $0 \notin B$, there exists a matching from $A$
to $B$. In prior work, matroid analogues of results concerning matchings in
groups were introduced and established. This paper serves as a second sequel,
extending that line of inquiry by investigating paving, Panhandle, and Schubert
matroids through the lens of matchability. While some proofs draw upon earlier
findings on the matchability of sparse paving matroids, the paper is designed
to be self-contained and accessible without reference to the preceding sequel.
Our approach combines tools from both matroid theory and additive number
theory.

We show that, for a $K_0$-regular projective normal surface $X$ over a
perfect field $k$ of positive characteristic and a reduced effective Cartier
divisor $D\hookrightarrow X$, the Chow group of zero cycles on $X$ with modulus
$D$ coincides with the 0-th Suslin homology of $X\setminus D$. Moreover, we
show that this isomorphism also holds for a projective smooth scheme of any
dimension with a reduced effective Cartier divisor.

A connected graph is called fragile if it contains an independent vertex cut.
In 2002 Chen and Yu proved that every connected graph of order $n$ and size at
most $2n-4$ is fragile, and in 2013 Le and Pfender characterized the
non-fragile graphs of order $n$ and size $2n-3.$ It is natural to consider
minimum vertex cuts. We prove two results. (1) Every connected graph of order
$n$ with $n\ge 7$ and size at most $\lfloor 3n/2\rfloor$ has an independent
minimum vertex cut; (2) every connected graph of order $n$ with $n\ge 7$ and
size at most $2n$ has a foresty minimum vertex cut. Both results are best
possible.

In this paper, we are interested in an inverse problem for the active scalar
equations with fractional dissipation on the torus. Our argument relies on the
divergence-free structure in the nonlinear term, the second order
linearization, the unique continuation property of the fractional Laplacian and
its associated Runge approximation property.

In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle
\dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect
square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation). Four weeks later,
Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains
perhaps the most famous example of a dissection. In this paper (over a century
later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral
triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal
pieces. We reduce the problem to the analysis of a discrete graph structure
representing the correspondence between the edges and vertices of the pieces
forming each polygon, using ideas from common unfolding.

The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture, also known as Frankl's conjecture, asks
whether, for any union-closed set family $\mathcal{F}$ with $m$ sets, there is
an element that lies in at least $\frac{1}{2}\cdot m$ sets in $\mathcal{F}$. In
2022, Nagel posed a stronger conjecture that within any union-closed family
whose ground set size is at least $k$, there are always $k$ elements in the
ground set that appear in at least $\frac{1}{2^{k-1}+1}$ proportion of the sets
in the family.
  Das and Wu showed that this conjecture is true for $k\geq 3$ and $k=2$ if
$|\mathcal{F}|$ is outside a particular range. In this companion paper, we
analyse further when $\mathcal{F}$ fails Nagel's conjecture for $k=2$ via
linear programming.

The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture asks whether every union-closed set family
$\mathcal{F}$ has an element contained in $\frac12 |\mathcal{F}|$ of its sets.
In 2022, Nagel posed a generalisation of this problem, suggesting that the
$k$th most popular element in a union-closed set family must be contained in at
least $\frac{1}{2^{k-1} + 1} |\mathcal{F}|$ sets.
  We combine the entropic method of Gilmer with the combinatorial arguments of
Knill to show that this is indeed the case for all $k \ge 3$, and when $k = 2$
and either $|\mathcal{F}| \le 44$ or $|\mathcal{F}| \ge 114$, and characterise
the families that achieve equality.
  Furthermore, we show that when $|\mathcal{F}| \to \infty$, the $k$th most
frequent element will appear in at least $\left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - o(1)
\right) |\mathcal{F}|$ sets, reflecting the recent progress made for the
Union-Closed Set Conjecture.

In this note, we compare and contrast various selective divergence properties
such as the properties of being discretely selective and selectively highly
divergent. We identify and incorporate a class of subsemigroups of the
semigroup of strictly increasing maps from the naturals to themselves. We
investigate certain implications for hyperspaces of finite subsets and
characterize the closed discrete selection game on a space in terms of a
particular selection game on the Vietoris hyperspace of finite subsets of that
space. We also isolate some sufficient conditions on a space that guarantee
that the corresponding Pixley-Roy hyperspace of finite subsets is discretely
selective. We end by noting that the properties of being discretely selective
and of being selectively highly divergent are equivalent in rings of continuous
functions with standard topologies of uniform convergence.

We initiate a new study on the correspondence between the 20-vertex model and
a SOS (Solid-on-Solid) model. In comparison to two previous works of the author
in 2024 which characterized properties of the transfer, and quantum monodromy,
matrices of the 20-vertex model from the perspective of the quantum inverse
scattering method, in addition to the structure of nonlocal correlations, the
forthcoming approach is an adaptation of a study on the rational 7-vertex
model. For the rational 7-vertex model, Antoenneko and Valinevich demonstrated
that the intertwining vectors can be used to transform the R-matrix of a vertex
model into the Boltzman weight matrix of an SOS model. To further develop
perspectives on classes of higher dimensional SOS models, by leveraging
previous computations with L-operators due to the author, and by also
manipulating q-exponentials, and other related factors from a factorization of
the universal R-matrix due to Boos et al, analogs of intertwining vectors for
the 20- vertex model can be obtained. In comparison to the system of equations
that have been obtained for the rational 7-vertex model, the system that one
obtains for the 20-vertex model consists of 9 equations for each entry of the
R-matrix. Furthermore, from the fact that the 20-vertex model contains more
possible configurations in the sample space than the rational 7-vertex model
does, the Boltzman weight matrix of the corresponding SOS model asymptotically
depends upon several contributions, a few of which include tensor products of
basis elements, and spectral parameters over the triangular lattice.

In this paper, we build some ergodic theorems involving function $\Omega$,
where $\Omega(n)$ denotes the number of prime factors of a natural number $n$
counted with multiplicities. As a combinatorial application, it is shown that
for any $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and every $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with positive upper
Banach density, there are $a,d\in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$a,a+d,\ldots,a+kd,a+\Omega(d)\in A.$$

This paper focuses on spectrum sharing in heterogeneous wireless networks,
where nodes with different Media Access Control (MAC) protocols to transmit
data packets to a common access point over a shared wireless channel. While
previous studies have proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based multiple
access protocols tailored to specific scenarios, these approaches are limited
by their inability to generalize across diverse environments, often requiring
time-consuming retraining. To address this issue, we introduce Generalizable
Multiple Access (GMA), a novel Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL)-based MAC
protocol designed for rapid adaptation across heterogeneous network
environments. GMA leverages a context-based meta-RL approach with Mixture of
Experts (MoE) to improve representation learning, enhancing latent information
extraction. By learning a meta-policy during training, GMA enables fast
adaptation to different and previously unknown environments, without prior
knowledge of the specific MAC protocols in use. Simulation results demonstrate
that, although the GMA protocol experiences a slight performance drop compared
to baseline methods in training environments, it achieves faster convergence
and higher performance in new, unseen environments.

Twisted right-angled Artin groups are defined through presentation based on
mixed graphs. Each vertex corresponds to a generator, each undirected edge
yields a commuting relation and each directed edge gives a Klein bottle
relation. If there is no directed edge, then this reduces to an ordinary
right-angled Artin group.
  There is a characterization of right-angled Artin groups which can be
embedded in knot groups by Katayama. In this paper, we completely determine
twisted right-angled Artin groups embedded in knot groups.

As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles,
and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural
elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies.
Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott)
functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real
algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions:
this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the
author. We present a new way of their construction.
  We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing
small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in
graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. They are
essentially so-called Reeb graphs of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they
are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.

The role of the unitary transformations in the Bell-CHSH inequality is
highlighted, in both Quantum Mechanics and relativistic Quantum Field Theory.
In the former case, we discuss, through a few examples, how the violation of
the Bell-CHSH inequality can be encoded into unitary transformations acting on
a given reference set of Bell's observables. In the latter case, the Bell-CHSH
inequality for a real massive scalar field in the vacuum state is considered.
After introducing suitable bounded Hermitian operators, we show that using
unitary transformations can significantly improve our previous numerical
algorithm, leading to an increase in the size of the violation.

We show that for at most three closed geodesics with linearly independent
directions, the homeomorphism type of its complement in the 3-torus is
determine by the orbit of their direction vectors subspaces under the action of
$\PSL_3(\mathbb{Z}).$ Moreover, we provide asymptotically sharp volume bounds
for a family of closed geodesics complements. The bounds depend only on the
distance in the Farey graph.

This study explores the properties of the function which can tile the field
$\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers by translation. It is established that
functions capable of tiling $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is by translation uniformly locally
constancy. As an application, in the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$, we addressed the
question posed by H. Leptin and D. M\"uller, providing the necessary and
sufficient conditions for a discrete set to correspond to a uniform partition
of unity. The study also connects these tiling properties to the Fuglede
conjecture, which states that a measurable set is a tile if and only if it is
spectral. The paper concludes by characterizing the structure of tiles in
\(\mathbb{Q}_p \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\), proving that they are spectral
sets.

We obtain the minimax rate for a mean location model with a bounded
star-shaped set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ constraint on the mean, in an
adversarially corrupted data setting with Gaussian noise. We assume an unknown
fraction $\epsilon<1/2-\kappa$ for some fixed $\kappa\in(0,1/2]$ of the $N$
observations are arbitrarily corrupted. We obtain a minimax risk up to
proportionality constants under the squared $\ell_2$ loss of
$\max(\eta^{*2},\sigma^2\epsilon^2)\wedge d^2$ with \begin{align*}
  \eta^* = \sup \bigg\{\eta : \frac{N\eta^2}{\sigma^2} \leq \log
M^{\operatorname{loc}}(\eta,c)\bigg\}, \end{align*} where $\log
M^{\operatorname{loc}}(\eta,c)$ denotes the local entropy of the set $K$, $d$
is the diameter of $K$, $\sigma^2$ is the variance, and $c$ is some
sufficiently large absolute constant. A variant of our algorithm achieves the
same rate for settings with known or symmetric sub-Gaussian noise, with a
smaller breakdown point, still of constant order. We further study the case of
unknown sub-Gaussian noise and show that the rate is slightly slower:
$\max(\eta^{*2},\sigma^2\epsilon^2\log(1/\epsilon))\wedge d^2$. We generalize
our results to the case when $K$ is star-shaped but unbounded.

We prove the essential self-adjointness of the d'Alembertian $\square_g$,
allowing a larger class of spacetimes than previously considered, including
those that arise from perturbing Minkowski spacetime by gravitational
radiation. We emphasize the fact, proven by Taira in closely related settings,
that all tempered distributions $u$ satisfying $\square_g u = \lambda u +f$ for
$\lambda\in \mathbb{C}\backslash \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ Schwartz are Schwartz. The
proof is fully microlocal and relatively quick given the ``de,sc-'' machinery
recently developed by the third author.

We show that Legendrian pre-quantization lifts of many non-exact Lagrangian
submanifolds in $\mathbb{C}^n$ retain some quantitative rigidity from the
symplectic base. In particular, they cannot be moved by Legendrian isotopy into
an arbitrarily small pre-quantized cylinder. This is a high dimensional
generalization of results of Dimitroglou Rizell--Sullivan in dimension 3. In
this setting, we give a new proof of non-squeezing using normal rulings, and in
high dimension, we obtain our results using a category of (micro)sheaves
associated to a Legendrian submanifold of pre-quantizations.

We define the orbit morphism of partial dynamical systems and prove that an
orbit morphism being an isomorphism in the category of partial dynamical
systems and orbit morphisms is equivalent to the existence of a continuous
orbit equivalence between the given partial dynamical systems that preserves
the essential stabilisers. We show that this is equivalent to the existence of
a diagonal-preserving isomorphism between the corresponding crossed products
when the essential stabilisers of partial actions are torsion-free and abelian.
We also characterize when an \'etale groupoid is isomorphic to the
transformation groupoid of some partial action. Additionally, we explore the
implications in the context of semi-saturated orthogonal partial dynamical
systems over free groups, establishing connections with Deaconu-Renault systems
and the concept of eventual conjugacy. Finally, we apply our results to
C*-algebras associated with generalized Boolean dynamical systems.

The study of the shape of droplets on surfaces is an important problem in the
physics of fluids and has applications in multiple industries, from
agrichemical spraying to microfluidic devices. Motivated by these real-world
applications, computational predictions for droplet shapes on complex
substrates -- rough and chemically heterogeneous surfaces -- are desired.
Grid-based discretisations in axisymmetric coordinates form the basis of
well-established numerical solution methods in this area, but when the problem
is not axisymmetric, the shape of the contact line and the distribution of the
contact angle around it are unknown. Recently, particle methods, such as
pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH), have been used to
conveniently forego explicit enforcement of the contact angle. The pairwise
force model, however, is far from mature, and there is no consensus in the
literature on the choice of pairwise force profile. We propose a new pair of
polynomial force profiles with a simple motivation and validate the PF-SPH
model in both static and dynamic tests. We demonstrate its capabilities by
computing droplet shapes on a physically structured surface, a surface with a
hydrophilic stripe, and a virtual wheat leaf with both micro-scale roughness
and variable wettability. We anticipate that this model can be extended to
dynamic scenarios, such as droplet spreading or impaction, in the future.

Conjugate phase retrieval considers the recovery of a function, up to a
unimodular constant and conjugation, from its phaseless measurements. In this
paper, we explore the conjugate phase retrieval in a shift-invariant space
generated by a Gaussian funciton. First, we show that the modulus function in
the Gaussian shift-invariant space can be determined from the phaseless Hermite
samples taken on a discrete sampling set. We then show that a function in the
shift-invariant space generated by a Gaussian can be uniquely determined, up to
a unimodular constant and conjugation, from its phaseless Hermite samples on a
discrete set. For the functions with finite coefficient sequences, we provide
an explicit reconstruction procedure.

In this study, we introduce novel methodologies designed to adapt original
data in response to the dynamics of persistence diagrams along Wasserstein
gradient flows. Our research focuses on the development of algorithms that
translate variations in persistence diagrams back into the data space. This
advancement enables direct manipulation of the data, guided by observed changes
in persistence diagrams, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and
interpretation in the context of topological data analysis.

Post-processing techniques are essential tools for enhancing the accuracy of
finite element approximations and achieving superconvergence. Among these,
recovery techniques stand out as vital methods, playing significant roles in
both post-processing and pre-processing. This paper provides an overview of
recent developments in recovery techniques and their applications in adaptive
computations. The discussion encompasses both gradient recovery and Hessian
recovery methods. To establish the superconvergence properties of these
techniques, two theoretical frameworks are introduced. Applications of these
methods are demonstrated in constructing asymptotically exact {\it a
posteriori} error estimators for second-order elliptic equations, fourth-order
elliptic equations, and interface problems. Numerical experiments are performed
to evaluate the asymptotic exactness of recovery type a posteriori error
estimators.

The categories of real and of complex Hilbert spaces with bounded linear maps
have received purely categorical characterisations by Chris Heunen and Andre
Kornell. These characterisations are achieved through Sol\`er's theorem, a
result which shows that certain orthomodularity conditions on a Hermitian space
over an involutive division ring result in a Hilbert space with the division
ring being either the reals, complexes or quaternions. The characterisation by
Heunen and Kornell makes use of a monoidal structure, which in turn excludes
the category of quaternionic Hilbert spaces. We provide an alternative
characterisation without the assumption of monoidal structure on the category.
This new approach not only gives a new characterisation of the categories of
real and of complex Hilbert spaces, but also the category of quaternionic
Hilbert spaces.

We visit and slightly modify the proof of Hanson-Wright inequality (HW
inequality) for concentration of Gaussian quadratic chaos where we are able to
tighten the bound by increasing the absolute constant in its formulation from
its largest currently known value of 0.125 to at least 0.145 in the symmetric
case. We also present a sharper version of the so-called Laurent-Massart
inequality (LM inequality) through which we are able to increase the absolute
constant in HW inequality from its largest currently available value of 0.134
due to LM inequality itself to at least 0.152 in the positive-semidefinite
case. Generalizing HW inequality in the symmetric case, we derive a sequence of
concentration bounds for Gaussian quadratic chaos indexed over m = 1, 2, 3,...
that involves the Schatten norms of the underlying matrix. The case m = 1
reduces to HW inequality. These bounds exhibit a phase transition in behaviour
in the sense that m = 1 results in the tightest bound if the deviation is
smaller than a critical threshold and the bounds keep getting tighter as the
index m increases when the deviation is larger than the aforementioned
threshold. Finally, we derive a concentration bound that is asymptotically
tighter than HW inequality both in the small and large deviation regimes.

In this paper, we study the local boundedness of local weak solutions to the
following parabolic equation associated with fractional $p$-Laplacian type
operators $$ \partial_t
u(t,x)-\text{p.v.}\int_{\R^d}|u(t,y)-u(t,x)|^{p-2}(u(t,y)-u(t,x))J(t;x,y)\,dy=0,\quad
(t,x)\in \R\times \R^d, $$ where $\text{p.v.}$ means the integral in the
principal value sense, $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $J(t;x,y)$ is comparable to the
kernel of the fractional $p$-Laplacian operator $|x-y|^{-d-sp}$ with
$s\in(0,1)$ and uniformly in $(t;x,y)\in\R\times\R^d\times\R^d$. Unlike
existing results in the literature, the local boundedness of the solutions
obtained in this paper extends the known results for the linear case (i.e., the
case that $p=2$), in particular with a nonlocal parabolic tail that uses the
$L^1$-norm in time for all $p\in (1,\infty)$. The proof is based on a new level
set truncation in the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser iteration and a careful choice of
iteration orders, as well as a general Caccioppoli-type inequality that is
efficiently applied to fractional $p$-Laplacian type operators with all $p>1$.

Let $\Bbbk$ be a field, and let $I$ be a monomial ideal in the polynomial
ring $R=\Bbbk[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. In her thesis, Taylor introduced a complex that
provides a finite free resolution of $R/I$ as an $R$-module. Building on this,
Ferraro, Martin and Moore extended this construction to monomial ideals in skew
polynomial rings. Since the Taylor resolution is generally not minimal,
significant effort has been devoted to identifying classes of ideals with
minimal free resolutions that are relatively straightforward to construct. In a
1987 paper, Eliahou and Kervaire developed a minimal free resolution for a
class of monomial ideals in $R$ known as stable ideals. This result was later
generalized to stable ideals in skew polynomial rings by Ferraro and Hardesty.
In a 2002 paper, Herzog and Takayama constructed a minimal free resolution for
monomial ideals with linear quotients, a broader class of ideals containing
stable ideals. Their resolution reduces to the Eliahou-Kervaire resolution in
the stable case. In this paper, we generalize the Herzog-Takayama resolution to
skew polynomial rings.

The accurate computational study of wavepacket nuclear dynamics is considered
to be a classically intractable problem, particularly with increasing
dimensions. Here we present two algorithms that, in conjunction with other
methods developed by us, will form the basis for performing quantum nuclear
dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. For one algorithm, we present a direct map
between the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepacket
time-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian that
describes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. This
map is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spin
states emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomes
approximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present a
general quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using a
method called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robust
and is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuit
complexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator
(QASM) for 3-7 qubits. In both cases the wavepacket dynamics is found to be in
good agreement with the classical result and the corresponding vibrational
frequencies obtained from the wavepacket density time-evolution, are in
agreement to within a few tenths of a wavenumbers.

We introduce a family of modules for the quantum affine algebra which include
as very special cases both the snake modules and the modules arising from a
monoidal categorification of cluster algebras. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for these modules to be prime and prove a unique factorization
result. We also give an explicit formula expressing the module as an
alternating sum of Weyl modules. Finally, we give an application of our results
to classical questions in the category $\mathcal{ O}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$.
Specifically we apply our results to show that there are a large family of
non-regular, non-dominant weights $\mu$ for which the non-zero Kazhdan-Lusztig
coefficients $c_{\mu, \nu}$ are $\pm 1$.

We carry out a gluing construction for collapsing warped-QAC
(quasi-asymptotically-conical) Calabi-Yau manifolds in $\CC^{n+2}, n\geq 2$.
This gluing theorem verifies a conjecture by Yang Li in \cite{li2019gluing} on
the behavior of the warped QAC Calabi-Yau metrics on affine quadrics when two
singular fibers of a holomorphic fibration go apart. We will also discuss a
bubble tree structure for those collapsing warped-QAC Calabi-Yau manifolds.

We study the long-term behavior of the iteration of a random map consisting
of Lipschitz transformations on a compact metric space, independently and
randomly selected according to a fixed probability measure. Such a random map
is said to be \emph{mostly contracting} if all Lyapunov exponents associated
with stationary measures are negative. This requires introducing the notion of
(maximal) Lyapunov exponent in this general context of Lipschitz
transformations on compact metric spaces. We show that this class is open with
respect to the appropriate topology and satisfies the strong law of large
numbers for non-uniquely ergodic systems, the limit theorem for the law of
random iterations, the global Palis' conjecture, and that the associated
annealed Koopman operator is quasi-compact. This implies many statistical
properties such as central limit theorems, large deviations, statistical
stability, and the continuity and H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents.
  Examples from this class of random maps include random products of circle
$C^1$ diffeomorphisms, interval $C^1$ diffeomorphisms onto their images, and
$C^1$ diffeomorphisms of a Cantor set on a line, all considered under the
assumption of no common invariant measure. This class also includes projective
actions of locally constant linear cocycles under the assumptions of simplicity
of the first Lyapunov exponent and some kind of irreducibility.
  One of the main tools to prove the above results is the generalization of
Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem and the uniform Kingman's subadditive
ergodic theorem for general Markov operators. These results are of independent
interest, as they may have broad applications in other contexts.

Network interference has garnered significant interest in the field of causal
inference. It reflects diverse sociological behaviors, wherein the treatment
assigned to one individual within a network may influence the outcome of other
individuals, such as their neighbors. To estimate the causal effect, one
classical way is to randomly assign experimental candidates into different
groups and compare their differences. However, in the context of sequential
experiments, such treatment assignment may result in a large regret. In this
paper, we develop a unified interference-based online experimental design
framework. Compared to existing literature, we expand the definition of arm
space by leveraging the statistical concept of exposure mapping. Importantly,
we establish the Pareto-optimal trade-off between the estimation accuracy and
regret with respect to both time period and arm space, which remains superior
to the baseline even in the absence of network interference. We further propose
an algorithmic implementation and model generalization.

In this paper we provide a novel mathematical optimization based methodology
to perturb the features of a given observation to be re-classified, by a tree
ensemble classification rule, to a certain desired class. The method is based
on these facts: the most viable changes for an observation to reach the desired
class do not always coincide with the closest distance point (in the feature
space) of the target class; individuals put effort on a few number of features
to reach the desired class; and each individual is endowed with a probability
to change each of its features to a given value, which determines the overall
probability of changing to the target class. Putting all together, we provide
different methods to find the features where the individuals must exert effort
to maximize the probability to reach the target class. Our method also allows
us to rank the most important features in the tree-ensemble. The proposed
methodology is tested on a real dataset, validating the proposal.

Jamitons are self-sustained traveling wave solutions that arise in certain
second-order macroscopic models of vehicular traffic. A necessary condition for
a jamiton to appear is that the local traffic density breaks the so-called
sub-characteristic condition. This condition states that the characteristic
velocity of the corresponding first-order Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR)
model formed with the same desired speed function is enclosed by the
characteristic speeds of the corresponding second-order model. The phenomenon
of collision of jamitons in second-order models of traffic flow is studied
analytically and numerically for the particular case of the second-order
Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic model [A.\ Aw, M.\ Rascle, {\it SIAM J.\ Appl.\
Math.} {\bf 60} (2000) 916--938; H.\ M.\ Zhang, {\it Transp.\ Res.\ B} {\bf 36}
(2002) 275--290]. A compatibility condition is first defined to select jamitons
that can collide each other. The collision of jamitons produces a new jamiton
with a velocity different from the initial ones. It is observed that the exit
velocities smooth out the velocity of the test jamiton and the initial
velocities of the jamitons that collide. Other properties such as the amplitude
of the exit jamitons, lengths, and maximum density are also explored.In the
cases of the amplitude and maximum exit density it turns out that over a wide
range of sonic densities, the exit values exceed or equal the input values. On
the other hand, the resulting jamiton has a greater length than the incoming
ones. Finally, the behavior for various driver reaction times is explored. It
is obtained that some properties do not depend on that time, such as the
amplitude, exit velocity, or maximum density, while the exit length does depend
on driver reaction time.

In this paper we derive a new first-order theory of dissipative fluids by
adopting the trace-fixed particle frame. Whereas in a companion paper we show
that this theory is hyperbolic, causal and stable at global equilibrium states,
here we prove that the full nonlinear system of equations can be cast into a
first-order quasilinear system which is strongly hyperbolic. By rewriting the
system in first-order form, auxiliary constraints are introduced. However, we
show that these constraints propagate, and thus our theory leads to a
well-posed Cauchy problem.

The main aim of this article is to prove that for any continuous function $f
\colon X \to X$, where $X$ is metrizable (or, more generally, for any family
$\mathcal{F}$ of such functions, satisfying an additional condition), there
exists a compatible metric $d$ on $X$ such that the $n$th iteration of $f$
(more generally, the composition of any $n$ functions from $\mathcal{F}$) is
Lipschitz with constant $a_k$ where $(a_k)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is an arbitrarily
fixed sequence of real numbers such that $1 < a_k$ and
$\lim\limits_{k\to+\infty}a_k = +\infty$. In particular, any dynamical system
can be remetrized in order to significantly control the distance between points
by their initial distance.

The eigenvalue spectrum of the sum of large random matrices that are mutually
"free", i.e. randomly rotated, can be obtained using the formalism of
R-transforms, with many applications in different fields. We provide a direct
interpretation of the otherwise abstract additivity property of R-transforms
for the sum in terms of a deterministic dynamical evolution of "particles" (the
eigenvalues), interacting through two-body and higher-body forces, generalizing
the usual Coulomb interaction. We extend our result to product of free
matrices.

In this work, we develop two methods to obtain a factorisation as a product
of bidiagonal matrices for the Hessenberg recurrence matrix of a system of
multiple orthogonal polynomials. One method is based on the Gauss-Borel
factorisation of the moment matrix of the system and of its Darboux
transformations, and the other uses the connection of multiple orthogonal
polynomials with production matrices and branched continued fractions. As a
case study, we present an explicit bidiagonal factorisation for the Hessenberg
recurrence matrix of the Jacobi-Pi\~neiro polynomials, using both methods, and
of the multiple Laguerre polynomials of first kind, as a limiting case.

Let $\mathbb{K}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and
$\mathbb{K}[x,y]$ the polynomial ring. The group
$\text{SL}_{2}\left(\mathbb{K}[x,y]\right)$ of all matrices with determinant
equal to $1$ over $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$ can not be generated by elementary
matrices. The known counterexample was pointed out by P.M. Cohn. Conversely,
A.A.Suslin proved that the group
$\text{SL}_{r}\left(\mathbb{K}[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]\right)$ is generated by
elementary matrices for $r\ge 3$ and arbitrary $n\geq 2$, the same is true for
$n=1$ and arbitrary $r.$ It is proven that any matrix from
$\text{SL}_{2}\left(\mathbb{K}[x,y]\right)$ with at least one entry of degree
$\le 2$ is either a product of elementary matrices or a product of elementary
matrices and of a matrix similar to the one pointed out by P. Cohn. For any
matrix $\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{cc} f & g\\ -Q & P
\end{array}\end{pmatrix}\in\text{SL}_{2}\left(\mathbb{K}[x,y]\right)$, we
obtain formulas for the homogeneous components $P_i , Q_i$ for the unimodular
row $(-Q, P) $ as combinations of homogeneous components of the polynomials $f,
g, $ respectively, with the same coefficients.

In safety-critical control, managing safety constraints with high relative
degrees and uncertain obstacle dynamics pose significant challenges in
guaranteeing safety performance. Robust Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs) offer
a potential solution, but the non-smoothness of the standard RCBF definition
can pose a challenge when dealing with multiple derivatives in high relative
degree problems. As a result, the definition was extended to the marginally
more conservative smooth Robust Control Barrier Functions (sRCBF). Then, by
extending the sRCBF framework to the CBF backstepping method, this paper offers
a novel approach to these problems. Treating obstacle dynamics as disturbances,
our approach reduces the requirement for precise state estimations of the
obstacle to an upper bound on the disturbance, which simplifies implementation
and enhances the robustness and applicability of CBFs in dynamic and uncertain
environments. Then, we validate our technique through an example problem in
which an agent, modeled using a kinematic unicycle model, aims to avoid an
unknown moving obstacle. The demonstration shows that the standard CBF
backstepping method is not sufficient in the presence of a moving obstacle,
especially with unknown dynamics. In contrast, the proposed method successfully
prevents the agent from colliding with the obstacle, proving its effectiveness.

Consider the problem of determining the optimal applied electric field to
drive a molecule from an initial state to a desired target state. For even
moderately sized molecules, solving this problem directly using the exact
equations of motion -- the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) -- is
numerically intractable. We present a solution of this problem within
time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, a mean field approximation of the
TDSE. Optimality is defined in terms of minimizing the total control effort
while maximizing the overlap between desired and achieved target states. We
frame this problem as an optimization problem constrained by the nonlinear TDHF
equations; we solve it using trust region optimization with gradients computed
via a custom-built adjoint state method. For three molecular systems, we show
that with very small neural network parametrizations of the control, our method
yields solutions that achieve desired targets within acceptable constraints and
tolerances.

This work makes analytic progress in the deterministic study of turbulence in
Hamiltonian systems by identifying two types of energy cascade solutions and
the corresponding large- and small-scale structures they generate. The first
cascade represents condensate formation via a highly coherent process recently
uncovered, while the second cascade, which has not been previously observed,
leads to the formation of other large-scale structures. The concentration of
energy at small scales is characterized in both cases by the development of a
power-law spectrum in finite time, causing the blow-up of Sobolev norms and the
formation of coherent structures at small scales. These structures approach two
different types of singularities: a point discontinuity in one case and a cusp
in the other. The results are fully analytic and explicit, based on two
solvable families of Hamiltonian systems identified in this study.

In this paper, we develop the first comprehensive tutorial on designing
future 6G networks that synergistically integrate notions of resilience and
criticality from the ground up. While resilience refers to the ability to
absorb, adapt to, and recover from adversarial or challenging conditions,
criticality indicates the degree of importance or urgency assigned to a
particular service or component. Despite a spiking interest in designing
resilient wireless networks, most prior works do not provide a unified
resilience definition, nor harness the intricate interplay between resilience
and criticality. In order to fill this gap, in this paper, we highlight the
importance of a criticality-aware approach as a key enabler for providing
reliable and resilient service functionality. Moreover, we delve into the
unique challenges and opportunities of the envisioned 6G features pertaining to
resilience and (mixed) criticality. After reviewing resilience definitions, we
present a core resilience strategy, a unified resilience metric, different
criteria for service criticality, and prioritization frameworks, that augment
the 6G resilience prospects. Afterwards, we explore the opportunities presented
by promising technologies that enable a resilient 6G network design from a
radio access network protocol stack perspective. We briefly revisit
state-of-the-art network architectures, establish a rough connection to the
Open-RAN Alliance vision, and discuss opportunities, existing techniques, and
promising enabling mechanisms for 6G at each layer. Finally, the article
discusses important research directions and open problems concerning resilience
and criticality in 6G.

We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a
metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site
Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional
(1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model
on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is
shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate
ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast
to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped
electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various
microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two
examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and
vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an
intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of
these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic
phase.

We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity (QG) amplitudes in fully
compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up
prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular,
finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable,
meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of
Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to
the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple
representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported
by a wide variety of string theory examples.

The problem of sampling according to the probability distribution minimizing
a given free energy, using interacting particles unadjusted kinetic Langevin
Monte Carlo, is addressed. In this setting, three sources of error arise,
related to three parameters: the number of particles $N$, the discretization
step size $h$, and the length of the trajectory $n$. The main result of the
present work is a quantitative estimate of strong convergence in relative
entropy, implying non-asymptotic bounds for the quadratic risk of Monte Carlo
estimators for bounded observables. The numerical discretization scheme
considered here is a second-order splitting method, as commonly used in
practice. In addition to $N,h,n$, the dependency in the ambient dimension $d$
of the problem is also made explicit, under suitable conditions. The main
results are proven under general conditions (regularity, moments, log-Sobolev
inequality), for which tractable conditions are then provided. In particular, a
Lyapunov analysis is conducted under more general conditions than previous
works; the nonlinearity may not be small and it may not be convex along linear
interpolations between measures.

Using Bailey's very-well-poised $_6\psi_6$ summation, we show that a specific
sequence of well-poised bilateral basic hypergeometric $_3\psi_3$ series form a
family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle. We further extract a
bilateral matrix inverse from Dougall's ${}_2H_2$ summation which we use, in
combination with the Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz summation, to derive a summation for a
particular bilateral hypergeometric $_3H_3$ series. We finally provide
multivariate extensions of the bilateral matrix inverse and the $_3H_3$
summation in the setting of hypergeometric series associated to the root system
$A_r$.

Expectation thresholds arise from a class of integer linear programs (LPs)
that are fundamental to the study of thresholds in large random systems. An
avenue towards estimating expectation thresholds comes from the fractional
relaxation of these integer LPs, which yield the fractional expectation
thresholds. Regarding the gap between the integer LPs and their fractional
relaxations, Talagrand made a bold conjecture, that the integral and fractional
expectation thresholds are within a constant factor of each other. In other
words, any small fractional solution can be ``rounded''.
  In this paper, we prove a strong upper bound on the expectation threshold
starting from a fractional solution supported on sets with small size. In
particular, this resolves Talagrand's conjecture for fractional solutions
supported on sets with bounded size. Our key input for rounding the fractional
solutions is a sharp version of Talagrand's selector process conjecture that is
of independent interest.

We prove a theorem of unique continuation in measure for nonlocal equations
of the type $(\partial_t - \Delta)^s u= V(x,t) u$, for $0<s <1$. Our main
result, Theorem 1.1, establishes a delicate nonlocal counterpart of the unique
continuation in measure for the local case $s=1$.

We study a particular type of finite-area, infinite-type translation
surfaces, and find an explicit cylinder decomposition on these surfaces which
do not manifest on finite-type translation surfaces.

We introduce and study a new class of compactified Jacobians for nodal
curves, that we call compactified Jacobians of vine type, or simply
V-compactified Jacobians. This class is strictly larger than the class of
classical compactified Jacobians, as constructed by Oda-Seshadri, Simpson,
Caporaso and Esteves.
  We characterize V-compactified Jacobians as the compactified Jacobians that
can arise as limits of Jacobians of smooth curves under a one-parameter
smoothing of the nodal curve, extending previous works on fine compactified
Jacobians by Pagani-Tommasi and Viviani to the case of all compactified
Jacobians.

We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrized
family of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection $M$ of
measures on $X$ under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\mathrm{dim}_H
\Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \mathrm{dim}_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu
\in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full-measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of
$\mu$). We require $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and $M$
to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. We also
prove that if the Assouad dimension of $X$ is smaller than d, then for almost
every $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz at $\mu$-a.e.
$x$, for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting can include
families of orthogonal projections, natural projections for conformal,
non-autonomous or random iterated functions systems.
  As an application, we prove that for a parametrized family of contracting
conformal IFS with natural projections $\Pi_\lambda$ satisfying the
transversality condition, for almost every parameter $\lambda$ one has
$\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{ d, \frac{h(\mu)}{\chi(\lambda, \mu)}
\}$ for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously.
  We also prove that for self-similar systems on the line with similarity
dimension smaller than one, for Lebesgue almost every choice of translations
the multifractal formalism holds simultaneously on the full spectrum interval
$\left[\min \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|},\max \frac{\log
p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|}\right]$ for every self-similar measure.
  We prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand-Mattila projection theorem
holds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on a
self-conformal set with the strong separation condition and without any
separation for the collection of all Gibbs measures.

Pin permutations play an important role in the structural study of
permutation classes, most notably in relation to simple permutations and
well-quasi-ordering, and in enumerative consequences arising from these. In
this paper, we continue our study of pin classes, which are permutation classes
that comprise all the finite subpermutations contained in an infinite pin
permutation. We show that there is a phase transition at $\mu\approx 3.28277$:
there are uncountably many different pin classes whose growth rate is equal to
$\mu$, yet only countably many below $\mu$. Furthermore, by showing that all
pin classes with growth rate less than $\mu$ are essentially defined by pin
permutations that possess a periodic structure, we classify the set of growth
rates of pin classes up to $\mu$.

Human actions have accelerated changes in global temperature, precipitation
patterns, and other critical Earth systems. Key markers of these changes can be
linked to the dynamic of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and related
quantities, such as Soil Moisture (SM), Above Ground Biomass (AGB), and
Freeze-Thaw (FT) Dynamics. These variables are crucial for understanding global
climate changes, hydrological and carbon cycles included. Monitoring these
variables helps to validate climate models and inform policy decisions.
Technologies like microwave remote sensing provide critical tools for
monitoring the effects of human activities on these variables at a global
scale. Other than proper tachenological developments, the study of ECVs
requires suitable theoretical retrieval tools, which leads to the solutions of
inverse problems. In this brief survey, we analyze and summarize the main
retrieval techniques available in the literature for SM, AGB, and FT, performed
on data collected with microwave remote sensing sensors. Such methods will be
some of the fundamental algorithms that can find applications in the research
activities of the interdisciplinary, curiosity-driven, project {\it REmote
sensing daTa INversion with multivariate functional modeling for essential
climAte variables characterization (RETINA)}, recently funded by the European
Union under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan of
NextGenerationEU, under the Italian Ministry of University and Research. The
main goal of RETINA, in which three research units from three different italian
universities are involved, is to create innovative techniques for analyzing
data generated by the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the Earth's
surface, applying theoretical insights to address real-world challenges.

HLL-type schemes constitute a large hierarchy of numerical methods, in the
finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element frameworks, for solving
hyperbolic equations. The hierarchy of fluxes includes Rusanov schemes, HLL
schemes, HLLC schemes, and other variations. All of these schemes rely on wave
speed estimates. Recent work has shown that most wave speed estimates in
current use underestimate the true wave speeds. In the present paper we carry
out a theoretical study of the consequences arising from errors in the wave
speed estimates, on the monotonicity and stability properties of the derived
schemes. For the simplest case of the hierarchy, that is Rusanov-type schemes,
we carry out a detailed analysis in terms of the linear advection equation in
one and two space dimensions. It is found that errors from underestimates of
the wave speed could cause loss of monotonicity, severe reduction of the
stability limit, and even loss of stability. Errors from overestimates, though
preserving monotonicity, will cause a reduction of the stability limit. We find
that overestimation is preferable to underestimation, for two reasons. First,
schemes from overestimation are monotone, and second, their stability regions
are larger than those from underestimation, for equivalent displacements from
the exact speed. The findings of this paper may prove useful in raising
awareness of the potential pitfalls of a seemingly simple practical
computational task, that of providing wave speed estimates. Our reported
findings may also motivate subsequent studies for complex non-linear hyperbolic
systems, requiring estimates for two or more waves, such as in HLL and HLLC
schemes.

In this note we review several situations in which stochastic PDEs exhibit
ergodic properties. We begin with the basic dissipative conditions, as stated
by Da Prato and Zabczyk in their classical monograph. Then we describe the
singular case of SPDEs with reflection. Next we move to some degenerate (and
thus more demanding) settings. Namely we recall some results obtained around
2006, concerning stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with a very degenerate
noise. We finish the article by handling some cases with degenerate
coefficients. This includes a new result about the parabolic Anderson model in
dimension $d\ge 3$, driven by a general class of noises and fairly general
initial conditions. In this context, a phase transition is observed, expressed
in terms of the noise intensity.

Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) unifies communication and model
aggregation by leveraging the inherent superposition property of the wireless
medium. This strategy can enable scalable and bandwidth-efficient learning via
simultaneous transmission of model updates using the same frequency resources,
if care is exercised to design the physical layer jointly with learning. In
this paper, a federated learning system facilitated by a heterogeneous
edge-intelligent network is considered. The edge users (clients) have differing
user resources and non-i.i.d. local dataset distributions. A general non-convex
learning objective is considered for the model training task(s) at hand. We
augment the network with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in order to
enhance the learning system. We propose a cross-layer algorithm that jointly
assigns communication, computation and learning resources. In particular, we
adaptively adjust the number of local steps in conjunction with RIS
configuration to boost the learning performance. Our system model considers
channel noise and channel estimation errors in both the uplink (model updates)
and downlink (global model broadcast), employing dynamic power control for
both. We provide the convergence analysis for the proposed algorithms and
extend the frameworks to personalized learning. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art joint
communication and learning baselines.

We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering
takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p},
\sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of
special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large
$p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical
transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a
`soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a
distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs
measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable
algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to
an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their
success probability is not vanishingly small.

Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity and $B = A[\theta]$ be an integral
extension of $A$. Assume that $B$ is an integral domain with quotient field
$\mathbb{K}$ and $\mathbb{E}$ is the minimal splitting field of $\theta$ over
$\mathbb{K}$. Suppose $\sigma, \tau: B \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ are two
different ring homomorphisms that fix $A$ element-wise. In this article, we
classify all $A$-linear maps $D: B \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ which are $(\sigma,
\tau)$-derivations. Consequently, we classify all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations
in certain field extensions, algebraic number fields, and their ring of
algebraic integers. For the ring of algebraic integers, $O_{\mathbb{K}} =
\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ of the cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{K} =
\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ ($\zeta$ an $n^{\text{th}}$ primitive root of unity), and a
pair $(\sigma, \tau)$ of two different $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra endomorphisms of
$O_{\mathbb{K}}$, we conjecture a necessary and sufficient condition for a
$(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation $D:O_{\mathbb{K}} \rightarrow O_{\mathbb{K}}$ to be
inner. This is done for two different forms of $n$: (i) $n = 2^{r}p$ ($r \in
\mathbb{N}$ and $p$ an odd rational prime), and (ii) $n=p^{k}$ ($k \in
\mathbb{N}$ and $p$ any rational prime). We also conjecture the existence and
non-existence of non-zero outer derivations for the above two forms of $n$,
thus answering the twisted derivation problem in $O_{\mathbb{K}}$.

In 1975, Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di asked for the smallest
$\tau$ such that an $n \times n \times n$ tripartite graph with minimum degree
$n + \tau$ must contain $K_{t, t, t}$, conjecturing that $\tau =
\mathcal{O}(n^{1/2})$ for $t = 2$. We prove that $\tau = \mathcal{O}(n^{1 -
1/t})$ which confirms their conjecture and is best possible assuming the widely
believed conjecture that $\operatorname{ex}(n, K_{t, t}) = \Theta(n^{2 -
1/t})$. Our proof uses a density increment argument.
  We also construct an infinite family of extremal graphs.

In a recent article, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied sets of recurrence
for actions of the multiplicative semigroup $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$ and provided
some sufficient conditions for sets of the form $S=\{(an+b)/(cn+d) \colon n \in
\mathbb{N} \}$ to be sets of recurrence for such actions. A necessary condition
for $S$ to be a set of multiplicative recurrence is that for every completely
multiplicative function $f$ taking values on the unit circle, we have that
$\liminf_{n \to \infty} |f(an+b)-f(cn+d)|=0.$ In this article, we fully
characterize the integer quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ which satisfy the latter
property. Our result generalizes a result of Klurman and Mangerel concerning
the pair $(n,n+1)$, as well as some results of Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun. In
addition, we prove that, under the same conditions on $(a,b,c,d)$, the set $S$
is a set of recurrence for finitely generated actions of $(\mathbb{N},
\times)$.

In this article, we propose a modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for
modeling pulse propagation in optical waveguides. The proposed model bifurcates
into a system of elliptic and hyperbolic equations depending on waveguide
parameters. The proposed model leads to a stable first-order system of
equations, distinguishing itself from the canonical nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation. We have employed the space-time discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin finite
element method to discretize the first-order system of equations. We present a
stability analysis for both the elliptic and hyperbolic systems of equations
and demonstrate the stability of the proposed model through several numerical
examples on space-time meshes.

In this article, we study $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of number rings by
considering them as commutative unital $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras. We begin by
characterizing all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations and inner $(\sigma,
\tau)$-derivations of the ring of algebraic integers of a quadratic number
field. Then we characterize all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the ring of
algebraic integers $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ of a $p^{\text{th}}$-cyclotomic number
field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ ($p$ odd rational prime and $\zeta$ a primitive
$p^{\text{th}}$-root of unity). We also conjecture (using SAGE and MATLAB) an
\enquote{if and only if} condition for a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation $D$ on
$\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ to be inner. We further characterize all $(\sigma,
\tau)$-derivations and inner $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the bi-quadratic
number ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{m}, \sqrt{n}]$ ($m$, $n$ distinct square-free
rational integers). In each of the above cases, we also determine the rank and
an explicit basis of the derivation algebra consisting of all $(\sigma,
\tau)$-derivations of the number ring.

Halin showed that any thick end of any graph contains an infinite grid. We
extend Halin's theorem to digraphs. More precisely, we show that for any
infinite family $\mathcal{R}$ of disjoint equivalent out-rays there is a grid
whose vertical rays are contained in $\mathcal{R}$. Furthermore, we obtain
similar results for in-rays and necklaces.

A lattice $(d,k)$-polytope is the convex hull of a set of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ whose coordinates are integers ranging between $0$ and $k$. We
consider the smallest possible distance $\varepsilon(d,k)$ between two disjoint
lattice $(d,k)$-polytopes. We propose an algebraic model for this distance and
derive from it an explicit formula for $\varepsilon(2,k)$. Our model also
allows for the computation of previously intractable values of
$\varepsilon(d,k)$. In particular, we compute $\varepsilon(3,k)$ when
$4\leq{k}\leq8$, $\varepsilon(4,k)$ when $2\leq{k}\leq3$, and
$\varepsilon(6,1)$.

We propose deep learning methods for classical Monge's optimal mass
transportation problems, where where the distribution constraint is treated as
penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the theory of Hilbert
space embeddings of probability measures. We prove that the transport maps
given by the proposed methods converge to optimal transport maps in the problem
with $L^2$ cost. Several numerical experiments validate our methods. In
particular, we show that our methods are applicable to large-scale Monge
problems.

The degrees of freedom of Active Flux are cell averages and point values
along the cell boundaries. These latter are shared between neighbouring cells,
which gives rise to a globally continuous reconstruction. The semi-discrete
Active Flux method uses its degrees of freedom to obtain Finite Difference
approximations to the spatial derivatives which are used in the point value
update. The averages are updated using a quadrature of the flux and making use
of the point values as quadrature points. The integration in time employs
standard Runge-Kutta methods. We show that this generalization of the Active
Flux method in two and three spatial dimensions is stationarity preserving for
linear acoustics on Cartesian grids, and present an analysis of numerical
diffusion and stability.

Over a smooth projective toric variety we study toric sheaves, that is,
reflexive sheaves equivariant with respect to the acting torus, from a
polyhedral point of view. One application is the explicit construction of the
torus invariant universal extension of two nef line bundles via polyhedral
inclusion/exclusion sequences.
  Second, we link the cohomology of toric sheaves to the cohomology of certain
constructible sheaves explicitly built out of the associated polyhedra. For the
latter we define a concrete double complex and a spectral sequence which
computes the cohomology of toric sheaves from the reduced cohomology of
polyhedral subsets living in the realification of the character lattice of the
toric variety.

In this article we show that generally almost regular flows, introduced by
Bamler and Kleiner, in closed 3-manifolds will either go extinct in finite time
or flow to a collection of smooth embedded minimal surfaces, possibly with
multiplicity. Using a perturbative argument then we construct piecewise almost
regular flows which either go extinct in finite time or flow to a stable
minimal surface, possibly with multiplicity. We apply these results to
construct minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds in a variety of circumstances, mainly
novel from the point of the view that the arguments are via parabolic methods.

Let $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero stable
curves with $(n+1)$-marked points. The collection
$\overline{\mathcal{M}}=\{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}\}_{n\geq 2}$ forms an
operad in the category of complex projective varieties; its homology $Hycom=
H_*(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ is called the Hypercommutative operad. In this
paper we construct a chain model for the hypercommutative operad, i.e. an
operad of chain complexes $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ which is weakly
equivalent to the operad of singular chains $C_*(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$. We
prove that $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ is the linear dual of the bar
construction $B(grav)$, where $grav$ is a chain model of the gravity operad
based on cacti without basepoint. This shows that the Gravity and
Hypercommutative operad are Koszul dual also at the chain level, refining a
previous result of Getzler. The construction is topological, since
$C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})(n)$ is the cellular complex associated to a
regular CW-decomposition of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$.

Violation of the CHSH inequality by a bipartite quantum state is now used in
many quantum applications. However, the explicit analytical expression for the
maximal value of the CHSH expectation under Alice and Bob spin measurements is
still known only in a two-qubit case. In the present article, for a two-qudit
state of an arbitrary dimension $d=2s+1\geq2$, we introduce the notion of the
spin-$s$ correlation matrix, having dimension $3\times3$ for all $d\geq2$;
establish its relation to the general correlation $(d^{2}-1)\times (d^{2}-1)$
matrix of this state within the generalized Pauli representation and derive in
terms of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix the explicit analytical expression for
the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under Alice and Bob spin-$s$
measurements in this state. Specifying this general expression for the
two-qudit GHZ state, the nonlocal two-qudit Werner state and some nonseparable
pure two-qudit states, we find that, under large spin ($s\geq1$) measurements
in each of these nonseparable states, including the maximally entangled one,
the CHSH inequality is not violated. Moreover, unlike the case of spin-$1/2$
measurements, where each pure nonseparable two-qubit state violates the CHSH
inequality and the maximal value of its CHSH expectation increases with a
growth of its entanglement degree, the situation under large spin measurements
is quite different --for a pure two-qudit state with a higher degree of
entanglement, the maximal value of the CHSH expectation turns out to be less
than for a pure two-qudit state with lower entanglement and even for a
separable one.

We study the scattering for the energy-subcritical stochastic nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation (SNLS) with additive noise. In particular, we examine
the long-time behavior of solutions associated with the noise
$\phi(x)g(t,\omega)dB(t,\omega)$ formed by a Schwartz function $\phi$, and an
adapted process $g(t,\omega)$ satisfying certain decay. Essentially, the aim of
the current paper is to prove almost sure scattering in the spaces $L^2$ and
the pseudo-conformal space $\Sigma$ for an initial data in $\Sigma$; also in
$H^1$ for an initial data in $H^1$.

We prove that the powers of an edge ideal with linear quotients must also
have linear quotients by employing a novel, easily implementable ordering of
the minimal generators. As a consequence, we give explicit formulas for the
projective dimension and Betti numbers of the edge ideals of whisker graphs. We
also prove that second and higher powers of the edge ideals of anticycles admit
linear quotient orderings, thus resolving an open question of Hoefel and
Whieldon in the affirmative.

In 2020 Bhavale and Waphare introduced the concept of a nullity of a poset as
nullity of its cover graph. According to Bhavale and Waphare, if a dismantlable
lattice of nullity k contains r reducible elements then 2 $\leq$ r $\leq$ 2k.
In 2003 Pawar and Waphare counted all non-isomorphic lattices with equal number
of elements and edges, which are precisely the lattices of nullity one.
Recently, Bhavale and Aware counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements
having nullity up to two. Bhavale and Aware also counted all non-isomorphic
lattices on n elements, containing up to three reducible elements, having
nullity k $\geq$ 2. In this paper, we count up to isomorphism the class of all
lattices on n elements containing four comparable reducible elements, and
having nullity three.

In this paper we study the validity and efficiency of a conformal version of
the CUSUM procedure for change detection both experimentally and theoretically.

We prove that the \emph{standard zero forcing number} $Z(G)$ and the
\emph{positive semidefinite zero forcing number} $Z_+(G)$ are equal for all
claw-free graphs $G$. This result resolves a conjecture proposed by the
computer program \emph{TxGraffiti} and highlights a connection between these
graph invariants in claw-free structures. As a corollary, we show that a graph
$G$ is claw-free if and only if every induced subgraph $H \subseteq G$
satisfies $Z(H) = Z_+(H)$.

We investigate a nested balls-in-boxes scheme in a random environment. The
boxes follow a nested hierarchy, with infinitely many boxes in each level, and
the hitting probabilities of boxes are random and obtained by iterated
fragmentation of a unit mass. The hitting probabilities of the first-level
boxes are given by a stick-breaking model $P_k = W_1 W_2\cdot \ldots\cdot
W_{k-1}(1- W_k)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, where $W_1$, $W_2,\ldots$ are
independent copies of a random variable $W$ taking values in $(0,1)$. The
infinite balls-in-boxes scheme in the first level is known as a Bernoulli
sieve. We assume that the mean of $|\log W|$ is infinite and the distribution
tail of $|\log W|$ is regularly varying at $\infty$. Denote by $K_n(j)$ the
number of occupied boxes in the $j$th level provided that there are $n$ balls
and call the level $j$ intermediate, if $j = j_n \to \infty$ and $j_n = o((\log
n)^a)$ as $n \to \infty$ for appropriate $a>0$. We prove that, for some
intermediate levels $j$, finite-dimensional distributions of the process
$(K_n(\lfloor j_n u\rfloor))_{u>0}$, properly normalized, converge weakly as
$n\to\infty$ to those of a pathwise Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, with the
integrand being an exponential function and the integrator being an inverse
stable subordinator. The present paper continues the line of investigation
initiated in the articles Buraczewski, Dovgay and Iksanov (2020) and Iksanov,
Marynych and Samoilenko (2022) in which the random variable $|\log W|$ has a
finite second moment, and Iksanov, Marynych and Rashytov (2022) in which $|\log
W|$ has a finite mean and an infinite second moment.

Hertzsprung patterns, recently introduced by Anders Claesson, are
subsequences of a permutation contiguous in both positions and values, and can
be seen as a subclass of bivincular patterns.
  This paper investigates Hertzsprung patterns within involutions, where
additional structural constraints introduce new challenges. We present a
general formula for enumerating occurrences of these patterns in involutions.
  We also analyze specific cases to derive the distribution of all Hertzsprung
patterns of lengths two and three.

We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial
polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity,
diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes
integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random
operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations
of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric
field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with
conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity
$\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix
analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory.
We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random
matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete
resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving
the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and
$\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the
components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices,
$\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures
for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of
their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection
method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the
spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a
more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk
transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by
numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and
3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.

In this article, we solve the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for measures
with a pluripolar part in compact K\"ahler manifolds. This result generalizes
the classical results obtained by Cegrell in bounded hyperconvex domains. We
also discuss the properties of the complex Monge--Amp\`ere operator in some
special cases.

We consider the computational strength of Power-OTMs, i.e., ordinal Turing
machines equipped with a power set operator, and study a notion of
realizability based on these machines.

The Thurston norm of a closed oriented graph manifold is a sum of absolute
values of linear functionals, and either each or none of the top-dimensional
faces of its unit ball are fibered. We show that, conversely, every norm that
can be written as a sum of absolute values of linear functionals with rational
coefficients is the nonvanishing Thurston norm of some graph manifold, with
respect to a rational basis on its second real homology. Moreover, we can
choose such graph manifold either to fiber over the circle or not. In
particular, every symmetric polygon with rational vertices is the unit polygon
of the nonvanishing Thurston norm of a graph manifold fibering over the circle.
In dimension $\ge 3$ many symmetric polyhedra with rational vertices are not
realizable as nonvanishing Thurston norm ball of any graph manifold. However,
given such a polyhedron, we show that there is always a graph manifold whose
nonvanishing Thurston norm ball induces a finer partition into cones over the
faces.

For any complex reductive group $G$ and any compact Riemann surface with
genus $g>1$, we show that every connected component of the associated character
variety has symplectic singularities, and has terminal singularities unless
$g=2$ and the Dynkin diagram of $G$ contains an $A_1$-component. We also show
that the identity component is $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial. The singularities caused
by irreducible local systems with automorphism groups larger than the centre of
$G$ are controlled by elliptic endoscopy.

We study the pair interaction on flat tori of functions whose Fourier
coefficients are positive and decay sufficiently rapidly. In dimension one we
find that the minimizer, up to translation, is the equidistant point set. In
dimension two, minimizing with respect to triplets we find that the minimizer
is the triangular lattice.

The PAMPA (Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted) method, proposed in
[R. Abgrall, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5: 370-402, 2023], combines
conservative and non-conservative formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws
to evolve cell averages and point values. Solutions to hyperbolic conservation
laws typically have an invariant domain, and ensuring numerical solutions stay
within this domain is essential yet nontrivial. This paper presents a novel
framework for designing efficient Invariant-Domain-Preserving (IDP) PAMPA
schemes. We first analyze the IDP property for updated cell averages in the
original PAMPA scheme, revealing the role of cell average decomposition and
midpoint values in maintaining the invariant domain. This analysis highlights
the difficulty of relying on continuous fluxes alone to preserve the invariant
domain. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple IDP limiter for cell
midpoint values, and propose a provably IDP PAMPA scheme that guarantees the
preservation of the invariant domain for updated cell averages without
requiring post-processing limiters. This approach contrasts with existing
bound-preserving PAMPA schemes, which often require additional convex limiting
to blend high-order and low-order solutions. Most notably, inspired by the
Softplus and Clipped ReLU functions from machine learning, we propose an
automatic IDP reformulation of the governing equations, resulting in an
unconditionally limiter-free IDP scheme for evolving point values. We also
introduce techniques to suppress spurious oscillations, enabling the scheme to
capture strong shocks effectively. Numerical experiments on 1D problems,
including the linear convection equation, Burgers equation, the compressible
Euler equations, and MHD equations, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of
the proposed IDP PAMPA scheme.

In 1999, Zhang proved that, for first passage percolation on the square
lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with i.i.d. non-negative edge weights, if the
probability that the passage time distribution of an edge $P(t_e = 0) =1/2 $,
the critical value for bond percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, then the passage
time from the origin $0$ to the boundary of $[-n,n]^2$ may converge to $\infty$
or stay bounded depending on the nature of the distribution of $t_e$ close to
zero. In 2017, Damron, Lam, and Wang gave an easily checkable necessary and
sufficient condition for the passage time to remain bounded. Concurrently,
there has been tremendous growth in the study of weak and strong disorder on
random graph models. Standard first passage percolation with strictly positive
edge weights provides insight in the weak disorder regime. Critical percolation
on such graphs provides information on the strong disorder (namely the minimal
spanning tree) regime.
  Here we consider the analogous problem of Zhang but now for a sequence of
random graphs $\{G_n:n\geq 1\}$ generated by a supercritical configuration
model with a fixed degree distribution. Let $p_c$ denote the associated
critical percolation parameter, and suppose each edge $e\in E(G_n)$ has weight
$t_e \sim p_c \delta_0 +(1-p_c)\delta_{F_\zeta}$ where $F_\zeta$ is the cdf of
a random variable $\zeta$ supported on $(0,\infty)$. The main question of
interest is: when does the passage time between two randomly chosen vertices
have a limit in distribution in the large network $n\to \infty$ limit? There
are interesting similarities between the answers on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and on
random graphs, but it is easier for the passage times on random graphs to stay
bounded.

Locally stationary processes (LSPs) provide a robust framework for modeling
time-varying phenomena, allowing for smooth variations in statistical
properties such as mean and variance over time. In this paper, we address the
estimation of the conditional probability distribution of LSPs using
Nadaraya-Watson (NW) type estimators. The NW estimator approximates the
conditional distribution of a target variable given covariates through kernel
smoothing techniques. We establish the convergence rate of the NW conditional
probability estimator for LSPs in the univariate setting under the Wasserstein
distance and extend this analysis to the multivariate case using the sliced
Wasserstein distance. Theoretical results are supported by numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the
practical usefulness of the proposed estimators.

We introduce a new notion of generalized log twisted curves, which are marked
nodal curves with additional data at the marked points. In the case when the
markings are distinct this notion agrees with the notion of twisted curve
introduced by Abramovich and Vistoli. In addition to developing the basic
notions and results, we study in this article the moduli of such curves as well
as contraction maps between them. This is motivated, in part, by applications
to twisted stable maps which will be studied in a subsequent article.

We introduce an algorithm for approximating the codebook probability that is
compatible with all successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding algorithms,
including SC list (SCL) decoding. This approximation is based on an auxiliary
distribution that mimics the dynamics of decoding algorithms with an SC
decoding schedule. Based on this codebook probability and SCL decoding, we
introduce soft-output SCL (SO-SCL) to generate both blockwise and bitwise
soft-output (SO).
  Using that blockwise SO, we first establish that, in terms of both block
error rate (BLER) and undetected error rate (UER), SO-SCL decoding of dynamic
Reed-Muller (RM) codes significantly outperforms the CRC-concatenated polar
codes from 5G New Radio under SCL decoding. Moreover, using SO-SCL, the
decoding misdetection rate (MDR) can be constrained to not exceed any
predefined value, making it suitable for practical systems.
  Proposed bitwise SO can be readily generated from blockwise SO via a weighted
sum of beliefs that includes a term where SO is weighted by the codebook
probability, resulting in a soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder. Simulation
results for SO-SCL iterative decoding of product codes and generalized LDPC
(GLDPC) codes, along with information-theoretical analysis, demonstrate
significant superiority over existing list-max and list-sum approximations.

Motivated by dynamic risk measures and conditional $g$-expectations, in this
work we propose a numerical method to approximate the solution operator given
by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE). The main ingredients for
this are the Wiener chaos decomposition and the classical Euler scheme for
BSDEs. We show convergence of this scheme under very mild assumptions, and
provide a rate of convergence in more restrictive cases. We then implement it
using neural networks, and we present several numerical examples where we can
check the accuracy of the method.

Scarf's algorithm--a pivoting procedure that finds a dominating extreme point
in a down-monotone polytope--can be used to show the existence of a fractional
stable matching in hypergraphs. The problem of finding a fractional stable
matching in a hypergraph, however, is PPAD-complete. In this work, we study the
behavior of Scarf's algorithm on arborescence hypergraphs, the family of
hypergraphs in which hyperedges correspond to the paths of an arborescence. For
arborescence hypergraphs, we prove that Scarf's algorithm can be implemented to
find an integral stable matching in polynomial time. En route to our result, we
uncover novel structural properties of bases and pivots for the more general
family of network hypergraphs. Our work provides the first proof of
polynomial-time convergence of Scarf's algorithm on hypergraphic stable
matching problems, giving hope to the possibility of polynomial-time
convergence of Scarf's algorithm for other families of polytope.

In this paper, we study the past asymptotics of $(2+1)$-dimensional solutions
to the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system which are close to
Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes on an initial hypersurface
diffeomorphic to a closed orientable surface $M$ of arbitrary genus. We prove
that such solutions are past causally geodesically incomplete and exhibit
stable Kretschmann scalar blow-up in the contracting direction. In particular,
they are $C^2$-inextendible towards the past where causal geodesics become
incomplete. Moreover, we show that geometry and matter are asymptotically
velocity term dominated toward the past, remaining close to their background
counterparts. Where the asymptotics do not coincide with those of the isotropic
background solution, the momentum support of the Vlasov distribution approaches
a smooth one-dimensional subbundle of the mass shell. Compared to previous
results in higher dimensions, inhomogeneous terms in the wave and Vlasov
equations factor in more strongly in our setting, which a priori creates
additional hurdles to establish stability. As a corollary, our main result
shows that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for certain polarized
$U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that emanate from a
spatial hypersurface diffeomorphic to $M\times\mathbb{S}^1$.

Collective measurements on identical and independent quantum systems are
advantageous in information extraction than individual measurements. However,
little is known about the distinction between restricted collective
measurements and genuine collective measurements in the multipartite setting.
In this work we establish a rigorous performance gap based on a simple and old
estimation problem, the estimation of a random spin state given three parallel
spins. Notably, we derive an analytical formula for the maximum estimation
fidelity of biseparable measurements and clarify its fidelity gap from genuine
collective measurements. Moreover, we show that this estimation fidelity can be
achieved by two- and one-copy measurements assisted by one-way communication in
one direction, but not the other way. Our work reveals a rich landscape of
multipartite nonclassicality in quantum measurements instead of quantum states
and is expected to trigger further studies.

We construct a theory of (etale) Berkovich motives. This is closely related
to Ayoub's theory of rigid-analytic motives, but works uniformly in the
archimedean and nonarchimedean setting. We aim for a self-contained treatment,
not relying on previous work on algebraic or analytic motives. Applying the
theory to discrete fields, one still recovers the etale version of Voevodsky's
theory. Two notable features of our setting which do not hold in other settings
are that over any base, the cancellation theorem holds true, and under only
minor assumptions on the base, the stable $\infty$-category of motivic sheaves
is rigid dualizable.

In this paper, we consider a general partially observed diffusion model with
periodic coefficients and with non-degenerate diffusion component. The
coefficients of such a model depend on an unknown (static and deterministic)
parameter which needs to be estimated based on the observed component of the
diffusion process. We show that, under a minimal assumption of identifiability,
and given enough regularity of the diffusion coefficients, a maximum likelihood
estimator of the unknown parameter converges to the true parameter value as the
sample size grows to infinity.

Deformations of knots and links in ambient space can be studied
combinatorially on their diagrams via local modifications called Reidemeister
moves. While it is well-known that, in order to move between equivalent
diagrams with Reidemeister moves, one sometimes needs to insert excess
crossings, there are significant gaps between the best known lower and upper
bounds on the required number of these added crossings. In this article, we
study the problem of turning a diagram of a split link into a split diagram,
and we show that there exist split links with diagrams requiring an arbitrarily
large number of such additional crossings. More precisely, we provide a family
of diagrams of split links, so that any sequence of Reidemeister moves
transforming a diagram with $c$ crossings into a split diagram requires going
through a diagram with $\Omega(\sqrt{c})$ extra crossings. Our proof relies on
the framework of bubble tangles, as introduced by Lunel and de Mesmay, and a
technique of Chambers and Liokumovitch to turn homotopies into isotopies in the
context of Riemannian geometry.

We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on
$\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving
wall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express the
one-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with step
initial condition along a space-like path.
  Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the model
under various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initial
condition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of the
region influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in
[Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in the
macroscopic empirical density.
  As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expression
for the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusing
on non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrary
density, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limit
distribution within the framework of particle positions.

Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and
of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past
decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de
Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms
lie hidden at the heart of work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet
and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we
extend and generalize the result of Rohleder by proving that the j+2:nd
eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian is less than or equal to the j:th
eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian for any compact Lipschitz domain in
dimension two or greater.

Liebmann's Theorem is a fundamental result stating that a compact connected
convex surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant mean curvature (cmc) is a
totally umbilical sphere. We extend this theorem to surfaces with boundary by
showing that a locally convex, embedded compact connected cmc surface, bounded
by a convex curve in a plane $P$, is contained in one of the halfspaces of
$\mathbb{R}^3$ determined by $P$. This extension leads to the conclusion that
spherical caps are the only examples of locally convex, embedded compact
connected cmc surfaces with non-zero curvature, bounded by a circle.

We investigate a new class of self-similar fractional Brownian fields, called
Weighted Tensorized Fractional Brownian Fields (WTFBS). These fields,
introduced in the companion paper \cite{ELLV}, generalize the well-known
fractional Brownian sheet (FBs) by relaxing its tensor-product structure,
resulting in new self-similar Gaussian fields with stationary rectangular
increments that differ from the FBs. We analyze the local regularity properties
of these fields and introduce a new concept of regularity through the
definition of Weighted Tensorized Besov Spaces. These spaces combine aspects of
mixed dominating smoothness spaces and hyperbolic Besov spaces, which are
similar in structure to classical Besov spaces. We provide a detailed
characterization of these spaces using Littlewood-Paley theory and hyperbolic
wavelet analysis.

The aim of this paper is to further develop the theory of packing trees in a
graph. We first prove the classic result of Nash-Williams \cite{NW} and Tutte
\cite{Tu} on packing spanning trees by adapting Lov\'asz' proof \cite{Lov} of
the seminal result of Edmonds \cite{Egy} on packing spanning arborescences in a
digraph. Our main result on graphs extends the theorem of Katoh and Tanigawa
\cite{KT} on matroid-based packing of rooted trees by characterizing the
existence of such a packing satisfying the following further conditions: for
every vertex $v$, there are a lower bound $f(v)$ and an upper bound $g(v)$ on
the number of trees rooted at $v$ and there are a lower bound $\alpha$ and an
upper bound $\beta$ on the total number of roots. We also answer the
hypergraphic version of the problem. Furthermore, we are able to solve the
augmentation version of the latter problem, where the goal is to add a minimum
number of edges to have such a packing. The methods developed in this paper to
solve these problems may have other applications in the future.

We consider three isogeny invariants of abelian varieties over finite fields:
the Galois group, Newton polygon, and the angle rank. Motivated by work of
Dupuy, Kedlaya, and Zureick-Brown, we define a new invariant called the
weighted permutation representation which encompasses all three of these
invariants and use it to study the subtle relationships between them. We use
this permutation representation to classify the triples of invariants that
occur for abelian surfaces and simple abelian threefolds.

We deepen the link between two classic areas of combinatorial optimization:
augmentation and packing arborescences. We consider the following type of
questions: What is the minimum number of arcs to be added to a digraph so that
in the resulting digraph there exists some special kind of packing of
arborescences? We answer this question for two problems: $h$-regular
\textsf{M}-independent-rooted $(f,g)$-bounded $(\alpha, \beta)$-limited packing
of mixed hyperarborescences and $h$-regular $(\ell, \ell')$-bordered $(\alpha,
\beta)$-limited packing of $k$ hyperbranchings. We also solve the undirected
counterpart of the latter, that is the augmentation problem for $h$-regular
$(\ell, \ell')$-bordered $(\alpha, \beta)$-limited packing of $k$ rooted
hyperforests. Our results provide a common generalization of a great number of
previous results.

We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t
\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T)
\times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the global
existence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data
$\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates global
well-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space
$\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove soliton
resolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniform
bounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s > 0$.
  Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equation
on Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending these
results, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data in a
generalized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spaces
in complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includes
the complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong
\mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target
$\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.

We derive asymptotic formulas with a secondary term for the (smoothly
weighted) count of number of integer solutions of height $\leqslant B$ with
local conditions to the equation $F(x_1,x_2,x_3)=m$, where $F$ is a
non-degenerate indefinite ternary integral quadratic form, and $m$ is a
non-zero integer satisfying $-m\Delta_F=\square$ which can grow like
$O(B^{2-\theta})$ for some fixed $\theta>0$. Our approach is based on the
$\delta$-variant of the Hardy--Littlewood circle method developed by
Heath-Brown.

Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$ equipped with
a complete $C^2$ K\"ahler metric $g$ such that the Ricci curvature is strictly
negative outside a compact subset. We prove that if $g$ is a K\"ahler-Ricci
soliton, then it is K\"ahler-Einstein. Several examples are given as
applications.

We study crossed modules in the context of algebras over an operad. To do so,
in the first section, we adapt the methods of Janelidze by reviewing the
notions of internal actions, precrossed modules and crossed modules in the
operadic case. Moreover, we extract the Peiffer relations, well known in the
Lie case, for precrossed modules over an arbitrary operad. We prove that our
notion of crossed modules is equivalent to the one of Janelidze by proving that
our crossed modules of algebras over a fixed operad are equivalent to
categories internal to algebras over this fixed operad. In the second section,
we study the notion of crossed modules of algebras over an operad as introduced
by Leray-Riviere-Wagemann in arXiv:2411.04614 and prove it to be equivalent to
the already existing notions of crossed modules. Roughly speaking, a crossed
module in the sense of Leray-Rivi\`ere-Wagemann is an algebra structure on a
chain complex concentrated in degrees 0 and 1. We highlight a "codescent"
process which allows us to endow the degree one and zero terms of the chain
complex with algebra structures such that the differential is an algebra
morphism. Moreover, we prove it to be a crossed module. In fact we prove that
the approach to crossed modules of Leray-Riviere-Wagemann is equivalent to the
one of Janelidze. This new approach, together with the codescent process,
allows us to introduce higher crossed modules in a very concise and explicit
way, and we prove them to be equivalent to n-fold categories internal to
algebras, for some n.

We prove a principle of linearized stability for traveling wave solutions to
neural field equations posed on the real line. Additionally, we provide the
existence of a finite dimensional invariant center manifold close to a
traveling wave, this allows to study bifurcations of traveling waves. Finally,
the spectral properties of the modulated traveling waves are investigated.
Numerical schemes for the computation of modulated traveling waves are
provided. We then apply these results and methods to study a neural field model
in a inhibitory stabilized regime. We showcase Fold, Hopf and Bodgdanov-Takens
bifurcations of traveling pulses. Additionally, we continue the modulated
traveling pulses as function of the time scale ratio of the two neural
populations and show numerical evidences for snaking of modulated traveling
pulses.

We investigate the notion of quasi-invariant states introduced in [2, 3] from
an analytic viewpoint.We give the structures of quasi-invariant states with
uniformly bounded cocycles. As a consequence, we can apply a Theorem of Kovacs
and Szucs to get a conditional expectation on fixed points and another of
Stormer to get an invariant semifinite trace under extra assumptions.

We study a system with finitely many groups of multi-action bandit processes,
each of which is a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action
spaces and potentially different transition matrices when taking different
actions. The bandit processes of the same group share the same state and action
spaces and, given the same action that is taken, the same transition matrix.
All the bandit processes across various groups are subject to multiple weakly
coupled constraints over their state and action variables. Unlike the past
studies that focused on the offline case, we consider the online case without
assuming full knowledge of transition matrices and reward functions a priori
and propose an effective scheme that enables simultaneous learning and control.
We prove the convergence of the relevant processes in both the timeline and the
number of the bandit processes, referred to as the convergence in the time and
the magnitude dimensions. Moreover, we prove that the relevant processes
converge exponentially fast in the magnitude dimension, leading to
exponentially diminishing performance deviation between the proposed online
algorithms and offline optimality.

We investigate branching processes in nearly degenerate varying environment,
where the offspring distribution converges to the degenerate distribution at 1.
Such processes die out almost surely, therefore, we condition on non-extinction
or add inhomogeneous immigration. Extending our one-dimensional limit results
we derive functional limit theorems. In the former case, the limiting process
is a time-changed simple birth-and-death process on $(-\infty, 0]$ conditioned
on survival at $0$, while in the latter, it is a time-changed stationary
continuous time branching process with immigration.

Consider standard first-passage percolation on $\mathbb Z^d$. We study the
lower-tail large deviations of the rescaled random metric $\widehat{\mathbf
T}_n$ restricted to a box. If all exponential moments are finite, we prove that
$\widehat{\mathbf T}_n$ follows the large deviation principle at speed $n$ with
a rate function $J$, in a suitable space of metrics. Moreover, we give three
expressions for $J(D)$. The first two involve the metric derivative with
respect to $D$ of Lipschitz paths and the lower-tail rate function for the
point-point passage time. The third is an integral against the $1$-dimensional
Hausdorff measure of a local cost. Under a much weaker moment assumption, we
give an estimate for the probability of events of the type $\{\widehat{\mathbf
T}_n \le D \}$.

This article compares the tensor method density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) with two neural network based methods -namely FermiNet and PauliNet) for
determining the ground state wavefunction of the many-body electronic
Schr{\"o}dinger problem. We provide numerical simulations illustrating the main
features of the methods and showing convergence with respect to some parameter,
such as the rank for DMRG, and number of pretraining iterations for neural
networks. We then compare the obtained energy with the methods for a few atoms
and molecules, for some of which the exact value of the energy is known for the
sake of comparison. In the last part of the article, we propose a new kind of
neural network to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger problem based on the training of
the wavefunction on a simplex, and an explicit permutation for evaluating the
wavefunction on the whole space. We provide numerical results on a toy problem
for the sake of illustration.

We prove a non-abelian arboreal Galois group result for certain maps with
non-real Julia set at an archimedean place. We investigate the question of
determining which polynomials defined over $\mathbb{R}$ have real Julia set.
Finally we show that for some certain classes of Latt\`es maps associated to
the duplication map on an elliptic curve has non-abelian arboreal Galois
groups.

This paper addresses the existence of equilibria for ResNet type Mean Field
Games problems. We introduce a relaxed Lagrangian approach on the Wasserstein
space to handle the non-convex optimization problem of mean field type. We
prove the existence of new relaxed Nash equilibria and we show that our
existence result encompasses the classical Mean Field Games problem's existence
result under convex data conditions.

An investment portfolio consists of $n$ algorithmic trading strategies, which
generate vectors of positions in trading assets. Sign opposite trades
(buy/sell) cross each other as strategies are combined in a portfolio. Then
portfolio turnover becomes a non linear function of strategies turnover. It
rises a problem of effective (quick and precise) portfolio turnover estimation.
Kakushadze and Liew (2014) shows how to estimate turnover via covariance matrix
of returns. We build a mathematical model for such estimations; prove a theorem
which gives a necessary condition for model applicability; suggest new turnover
estimations; check numerically the preciseness of turnover estimations for
algorithmic strategies on USA equity market.

Halin proved that every graph with an end $\omega$ containing infinitely many
pairwise disjoint rays admits a subdivision of the infinite quarter-grid as a
subgraph where all rays from that subgraph belong to $\omega$. We will prove a
corresponding statement for digraphs, that is, we will prove that every digraph
that has an end with infinitely many pairwise disjoint directed rays contains a
subdivision of a grid-like digraph all of whose directed rays belong to that
end.

In this paper, we consider the existence and multiplicity of prescribed mass
solutions to the following nonlinear Schrodinger equations with mixed
nonlinearities. The standard approach based on the Pohozaev identity to obtain
normalized solutions is invalid as the presence of potential. Besides, Our
study can be regarded as a Sobolev critical case complement of Bartsch-Qi-Zou
(Math Ann 390, 4813-4859, 2024), which has addressed an open problem raised in
Bartsch et al.(Commun Partial Differ Equ 46(9):1729-1756,2021).

We consider a Schr\"odinger bridge problem where the Markov process is
subject to parameter perturbations, forming an ensemble of systems. Our
objective is to steer this ensemble from the initial distribution to the final
distribution using controls robust to the parameter perturbations. Utilizing
the path integral formalism, we demonstrate that the optimal control is a
non-Markovian strategy, specifically a stochastic feedforward control, which
depends on past and present noise. This unexpected deviation from established
strategies for Schr\"odinger bridge problems highlights the intricate
interrelationships present in the system's dynamics. From the perspective of
optimal transport, a significant by-product of our work is the demonstration
that, when the evolution of a distribution is subject to parameter
perturbations, it is possible to robustly deform the distribution to a desired
final state using stochastic feedforward controls.

A problem of reconstructing words from their subwords involves determining
the minimum amount of information needed, such as multisets of scattered
subwords of a specific length or the frequency of scattered subwords from a
given set, in order to uniquely identify a word. In this paper we show that a
cyclic word on a binary alphabet can be reconstructed by its scattered subwords
of length $\frac34n+4$, and for each $n$ one can find two cyclic words of
length $n$ which have the same set of scattered subwords of length
$\frac34n-\frac32$.

A smooth projective toric variety $X=X_\Sigma$ has a geometric quotient
description $V /\!/ T$. Using $2|1$-pointed quasimap invariants, one can define
a quantum $H^*(T)$-module $QM(X)$, which deforms a natural module structure
given by the Kirwan map $H^*(T) \rightarrow H^*(X)$. The Batyrev ring of $X$,
defined from combinatorial data of the fan $\Sigma$, has its natural module
structure given by the quotient of a polynomial ring, say BatM$(X)$. In this
paper, we prove that $QM(X)$ and BatM$(X)$ are naturally isomorphic when $X$ is
semipositive.

Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ and let $\mathcal{G}_K =
\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}_p}/K)$. Fontaine has constructed a useful
classification of $p$-adic representations of $\mathcal{G}_K$ in terms of
cyclotomic $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. Lately, interest has risen around a
generalization of the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, replacing the
cyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie
extension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors
should provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified
$p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya.
  In this paper, we focus on the case of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using
recent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally
analytic vectors, and prove that Kedlaya's conjecture does not hold for
anticyclotomic extensions. This also provide an example of an extension for
which there is no overconvergent lift of its field of norms and for which there
exist nontrivial higher locally analytic vectors

Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by
neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated
effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with
irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity
assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling
direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish
theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust
solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the
model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in
scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the
approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health
monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.

The $\ell^1$ and total variation (TV) penalties have been used successfully
in many areas, and the combination of the $\ell^1$ and TV penalties can lead to
further improved performance. In this work, we investigate the mathematical
theory and numerical algorithms for the $\ell^1$-TV model in the context of
signal recovery: we derive the sample complexity of the $\ell^1$-TV model for
recovering signals with sparsity and gradient sparsity. Also we propose a novel
algorithm (PGM-ISTA) for the regularized $\ell^1$-TV problem, and establish its
global convergence and parameter selection criteria. Furthermore, we construct
a fast learned solver (LPGM-ISTA) by unrolling PGM-ISTA. The results for the
experiment on ECG signals show the superior performance of LPGM-ISTA in terms
of recovery accuracy and computational efficiency.

The strong vertex (edge) span of a given graph $G$ is the maximum distance
that two players can maintain at all times while visiting all vertices (edges)
of $G$ and moving either to an adjacent vertex or staying in the current
position independently of each other. We introduce the notions of switching
walks and triod size of a tree, which are used to determine the strong vertex
and the strong edge span of an arbitrary tree. The obtained results are used in
an algorithm that computes the strong vertex (edge) span of the input tree in
linear time.

A special inverse monoid is one defined by a presentation where all the
defining relations have the form $r = 1$. By a result of Ivanov Margolis and
Meakin the word problem for such an inverse monoid can often be reduced to the
word problem in its maximal group image together with membership in a
particular submonoid of that group, called the prefix monoid, being decidable.
We prove several results that give sufficient conditions for the prefix
membership problem of a finitely presented group to be decidable. These
conditions are given in terms of the existence of particular factorisations of
the relator words. In particular we are able to find sufficient conditions for
a special inverse monoid, its maximal group image and its group of units to
have word problems that are algorithmically equivalent. These results extend
previous results for one-relator groups to arbitrary finitely presented groups.
We then apply these results to solve the word problem in various families of
E-unitary special inverse monoids. We also find some criteria for when
amalgamations of E-unitary inverse monoids are themselves E-unitary.

We revisit certain one-parameter families of affine covers arising naturally
from Euler's integral representation of hypergeometric functions. We introduce
a partial compactification of this family. We show that the zeta function of
the fibers in the family can be written as an explicit product of $L$-series
attached to nondegenerate hypergeometric motives and zeta functions of tori,
twisted by Hecke Grossencharacters. This permits a combinatorial algorithm for
computing the Hodge numbers of the family.

We present a sequent calculus for first-order logic with lambda terms and
definite descriptions. The theory formalised by this calculus is essentially
Russellian, but avoids some of its well known drawbacks and treats definite
description as genuine terms. A constructive proof of the cut elimination
theorem and a Henkin-style proof of completeness are the main results of this
contribution.

Let $H^\infty$ denotes the algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the
unit disk. It is well-known that every (algebra) automorphism of $H^\infty$ is
a composition operator induced by disc automorphism. Maurya et al., (J. Math.
Anal. Appl. 530 : Paper No: 127698, 2024) proved that every automorphism of the
subalgebras $\{f\in H^\infty : f(0) = 0\}$ or $\{f\in H^\infty : f'(0) = 0\}$
is a composition operator induced by a rotation. In this article, we give very
simple proof of their results. As an interesting generalization, for any
$\psi\in H^\infty$, we show that every automorphism of $\psi H^\infty$ must be
a composition operator and characterize all such composition operators. Using
this characterization, we find all automorphism of $\psi H^\infty$ for few
choices of $\psi$ with various nature depending on its zeros.

Let $A$ be a $1$-algebra. The Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture [K2] states
that the homotopy category $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathrm{Act}(A))$ of actions of
$2$-algebras on $A$ has a final object and that this object is weakly
equivalent to the pair $(\mathrm{Hoch}(A), A)$, where $\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$ is the
cochain Hochschild complex of $A$. Here the category of actions is the category
whose objects are pairs $(B,A)$ which are algebras of the chain Swiss Cheese
operad such that the induced action of the little interval operad on the
component $A$ coincides with the $1$-structure on $A$.
  We prove that there is a colored dg operad ${O}$ with 2 colors, weakly
equivalent to the chain Swiss Cheese operad for which the following ``stricter"
version of the Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture holds. Denote the two colors
of ${O}$ by $a$ (for the 1-algebra argument) and $c$ (for the 2-algebra
argument), denote by $E_1^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $a$, and
by $E_2^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $c$. Let
$\mathrm{Alg}({O})$ be the category of dg algebras over ${O}$. For a fixed
$1$-algebra $A$ we also have the the category of action $\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A$
(equal to $\mathrm{Act}(A)$ in case of the Swiss Cheese operad). We prove that
there is an equivalence of categories $$\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A \cong
\mathrm{Alg}(E_2^{{O}})/\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$$ We stress that for this particular
model of Swiss Cheese operad the statement holds on the chain level, without
passage to the homotopy category.

In this paper, we present new objects, quilts of alternating sign matrices
with respect to two given posets. Quilts generalize several commonly used
concepts in mathematics. For example, the rank function on submatrices of a
matrix gives rise to a quilt with respect to two Boolean lattices. When the two
posets are chains, a quilt is equivalent to an alternating sign matrix and its
corresponding corner sum matrix. Quilts also generalize the monotone Boolean
functions counted by the Dedekind numbers. Quilts form a distributive lattice
with many beautiful properties and contain many classical and well-known
sublattices, such as the lattice of matroids of a given rank and ground set.
While enumerating quilts is hard in general, we prove two major enumerative
results, when one of the posets is an antichain and when one of them is a
chain. We also give some bounds for the number of quilts when one poset is the
Boolean lattice.

In this paper we study the mixed Poincar\'e polynomial of generic parabolic
$\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-character varieties with coefficients in some
local systems arising from the conjugacy class of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$
which has a non-connected stabiliser. We give a conjectural formula that we
prove to be true under the Euler specialisation. We then prove that this
conjectured formula interpolates the structure coefficients of the two based
rings$
\left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)),Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_2),*\right)$
and $\left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)),
CS(\mathrm{SL}_2),\cdot\right) $ where for a group $H$, $\mathcal{C}(H)$
denotes the space of complex valued class functions on $H$,
$Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_2)$ denotes the basis of characteristic functions of
intermediate extensions of equivariant local systems on conjugacy classes of
$\mathrm{PGL}_2$ and $CS(\mathrm{SL}_2)$ the basis of characteristic functions
of Lusztig's character-sheaves on $\mathrm{SL}_2$. Our result reminds us of a
non-abelian Fourier transform.

This paper is a part of series of articles where we reprove the statements
regarding the abstract six-functor formalism developed by Liu-Zheng. In this
paper, we prove a theorem which is an $\infty$-categorical version for defining
the exceptional pushforward functor in an abstract-six functor formalism. The
article involves defining specific combinatorial simplcial sets related to the
idea of compactifications and pullback squares. This theorem plays a key role
in constructing the abstract six-functor formalism which shall be constructed
in the forthcoming article.

A ghor algebra is a path algebra with relations of a dimer quiver in a
compact surface. We show that the global dimension of any cyclic localization
of a geodesic ghor algebra on a genus $g \geq 1$ surface is bounded above by
$2g+1$.This number coincides with the Krull dimension of the center of the ghor
algebra. We further show that the bound is an equality if and only if the point
of localization sits over the noetherian locus of the center.

We study travelling wave solutions of a generalised Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers
equation with a non-local diffusion term and a concave-convex flux. This model
equation arises in the analysis of a shallow water flow by performing formal
asymptotic expansions associated to the triple-deck regularisation (which is an
extension of classical boundary layer theory). The resulting non-local operator
is a fractional type derivative with order between $1$ and $2$. Travelling wave
solutions are typically analysed in relation to shock formation in the full
shallow water problem. We show rigorously the existence of travelling waves
that, formally, in the limit of vanishing diffusion and dispersion would give
rise to non-classical shocks, that is, shocks that violate the Lax entropy
condition. The proof is based on arguments that are typical in dynamical
systems. The nature of the non-local operator makes this possible, since the
resulting travelling wave equation can be seen as a delayed
integro-differential equation. Thus, linearisation around critical points,
continuity with respect to parameters and a shooting argument, are the main
steps that we have proved and adapted for solving this problem.

Opinion and belief dynamics are a central topic in the study of social
interactions through dynamical systems. In this work, we study a model where,
at each discrete time, all the agents update their opinion as an average of
their intrinsic opinion and the opinion of their neighbors. While it is
well-known how to compute the stable opinion state for a given network,
studying the dynamics becomes challenging when the network is uncertain.
Motivated by the task of finding optimal policies by a decision-maker that aims
to incorporate the opinion of the agents, we address the question of how well
the stable opinions can be approximated when the underlying network is random.
  We consider Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs to model the uncertain network.
Under the connectivity regime and an assumption of minimal stubbornness, we
show the expected value of the stable opinion $\mathbf{E}(x(G,\infty))$
concentrates, as the size of the network grows, around the stable opinion
$\bar{x}(\infty)$ obtained by considering a mean-field dynamical system, i.e.,
averaging over the possible network realizations. For both the directed and
undirected graph model, the concentration holds under the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm
to measure the gap between $\mathbf{E}(x(G,\infty))$ and $\bar{x}(\infty)$. We
deduce this result by studying a mean-field approximation of general analytic
matrix functions. The approximation result for the directed graph model also
holds for any $\ell_{\rho}$-norm with $\rho\in (1,\infty)$, under a slightly
enhanced expected average degree.

The language of homotopy type theory has proved to be appropriate as an
internal language for various higher toposes, for example with Synthetic
Algebraic Geometry for the Zariski topos. In this paper we apply such
techniques to the higher topos corresponding to the light condensed sets of
Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze. This seems to be an appropriate setting to
develop synthetic topology, similar to the work of Mart\'in Escard\'o. To
reason internally about light condensed sets, we use homotopy type theory
extended with 4 axioms. Our axioms are strong enough to prove Markov's
principle, LLPO and the negation of WLPO. We also define a type of open
propositions, inducing a topology on any type. This leads to a synthetic
topological study of (second countable) Stone and compact Hausdorff spaces.
Indeed all functions are continuous in the sense that they respect this induced
topology, and this topology is as expected for these classes of types. For
example, any map from the unit interval to itself is continuous in the usual
epsilon-delta sense. We also use the synthetic homotopy theory given by the
higher types of homotopy type theory to define and work with cohomology. As an
application, we prove Brouwer's fixed-point theorem internally.

In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations in the half plane at high Reynolds number regime, when
the initial vorticity belongs to the Yudovich class and is supported away from
the boundary. We prove the $L^p$ ($2\leq p< \infty$) convergence from the
Naiver-Stokes equations to the Euler equations. The key point is to introduce a
good functional framework to control the interaction between rough vortex patch
and boundary layer.

Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of
dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings
of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render
the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman
operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in
a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been
successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing
mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open
question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete
convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method
where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem
in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level
problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which
could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical
pendulum and the compass-gait walker.

We prove a result that relates Donaldson-Futaki type invariants (that is, the
numerical invariants used to define $K$-stability for general polarised
manifolds) for a toric polarised manifold and for a compactification of its
mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, nearby the large volume limit. In general, this
expansion contains a term involving the base loci of certain linear systems
determined by the Landau-Ginzburg potential (as expected from known
constructions of compactified mirrors), and we give a condition under which
this term is subleading.

In a remarkable article Ribet showed how to attach rational $2$-dimensional
representations to elliptic ${\mathbb Q}$-curves. An abelian variety $A$ is a
(weak) $K$-variety if it is isogenous to all of its $\text{Gal}_K$-conjugates.
In this article we study the problem of attaching an absolutely irreducible
$\ell$-adic representation of $\text{Gal}_K$ to an abelian $K$-variety, which
sometimes has smaller dimension than expected. When possible, we also construct
a Galois-equivariant pairing, which restricts the image of this representation.
As an application of our construction, we prove modularity of abelian surfaces
over ${\mathbb Q}$ with potential quaternionic multiplication.

We study quantum neural networks where the generated function is the
expectation value of the sum of single-qubit observables across all qubits. In
[Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726], it is proven that the probability
distributions of such generated functions converge in distribution to a
Gaussian process in the limit of infinite width for both untrained networks
with randomly initialized parameters and trained networks. In this paper, we
provide a quantitative proof of this convergence in terms of the Wasserstein
distance of order $1$. First, we establish an upper bound on the distance
between the probability distribution of the function generated by any untrained
network with finite width and the Gaussian process with the same covariance.
This proof utilizes Stein's method to estimate the Wasserstein distance of
order $1$. Next, we analyze the training dynamics of the network via gradient
flow, proving an upper bound on the distance between the probability
distribution of the function generated by the trained network and the
corresponding Gaussian process. This proof is based on a quantitative upper
bound on the maximum variation of a parameter during training. This bound
implies that for sufficiently large widths, training occurs in the lazy regime,
\emph{i.e.}, each parameter changes only by a small amount. While the
convergence result of [Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726] holds at a
fixed training time, our upper bounds are uniform in time and hold even as $t
\to \infty$.

In this paper, we consider cell-free communication systems with several
access points (APs) serving terrestrial users (UEs) simultaneously. To enhance
the uplink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output communications, we adopt a
hybrid-CSI-based two-layer distributed multi-user detection scheme comprising
the local minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detection at APs and the one-shot
weighted combining at the central processing unit (CPU). Furthermore, to
improve the propagation environment, we introduce multiple reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) to assist the transmissions from UEs to APs. Aiming
to maximize the weighted sum rate, we formulate the weighted sum-MMSE (WMMSE)
problem, where the UEs' beamforming matrices, the CPU's weighted combining
matrix, and the RISs' phase-shifting matrices are alternately optimized.
Considering the limited fronthaul capacity constraint in cell-free networks, we
resort to the operator-valued free probability theory to derive the asymptotic
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the WMMSE problem, which only
depends on long-term channel statistics and thus reduces the interaction
overhead. Numerical results demonstrate that the asymptotic AO algorithm can
achieve a high communication rate as well as reduce the interaction overhead.

In autonomous navigation, trajectory replanning, refinement, and control
command generation are essential for effective motion planning. This paper
presents a resilient approach to trajectory replanning addressing scenarios
where the initial planner's solution becomes infeasible. The proposed method
incorporates a hybrid A* algorithm to generate feasible trajectories when the
primary planner fails and applies a soft constraints-based smoothing technique
to refine these trajectories, ensuring continuity, obstacle avoidance, and
kinematic feasibility. Obstacle constraints are modelled using a dynamic
Voronoi map to improve navigation through narrow passages. This approach
enhances the consistency of trajectory planning, speeds up convergence, and
meets real-time computational requirements. In environments with around 30\% or
higher obstacle density, the ratio of free space before and after placing new
obstacles, the Resilient Timed Elastic Band (RTEB) planner achieves
approximately 20\% reduction in traverse distance, traverse time, and control
effort compared to the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner and Nonlinear Model
Predictive Control (NMPC) planner. These improvements demonstrate the RTEB
planner's potential for application in field robotics, particularly in
agricultural and industrial environments, where navigating unstructured terrain
is crucial for ensuring efficiency and operational resilience.

In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS)
superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a
maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace
geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times
\mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting,
$\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace
$\mathsf{OSp}(\cal{N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times
\mathsf{O}(\cal{N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2,
\mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two
frameworks are related. We give explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal
N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and
${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe:
(i) the $\kappa$-symmetric action for a superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal
N}} $; and (ii) some implications of conformal flatness in the ${\cal N}=2$
case.

We proved that on every Stiefel manifold $V_2\mathbb{R}^n\cong
\operatorname{SO}(n)/\operatorname{SO}(n-2)$ with $n\ge 3$ the normalized Ricci
flow preserves the positivity of the Ricci curvature of invariant Riemannian
metrics with positive Ricci curvature. Moreover, the normalized Ricci flow
evolves all metrics with mixed Ricci curvature into metrics with positive Ricci
curvature in finite time. From the point of view of the theory of dynamical
systems we proved that for every invariant set~$\Sigma$ of the normalized Ricci
flow on~$V_2\mathbb{R}^n$ defined as $x_1^{n-2}x_2^{n-2}x_3=c$, $c>0$, there
exists a smaller invariant set $\Sigma\cap \mathscr{R}_{+}$ for every $n\ge 3$,
where~$\mathscr{R}_{+}$ is the domain in $\mathbb{R}_{+}^3$ responsible for
parameters $x_1, x_2, x_3>0$ of invariant Riemannian metrics
on~$V_2\mathbb{R}^n$ admitting positive Ricci curvature.

We classify the shift operators for the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials
and construct shift operators for the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials
using two decompositions of non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials in terms of
symmetric ones. These shift operators are difference-reflection operators, and
we discuss the conditions under which they restrict to shift operators for the
symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials. We use them to compute the norms of the
non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials and compute their specialisations for
$q\to1$. These turn out to be shift operators for the non-symmetric
Heckman-Opdam polynomials of type $BC_1$ that have recently been found.

A transitive permutation group is said to be semiprimitive if each of its
normal subgroups is either semiregular or transitive.The class of semiprimitive
groups properly contains primitive groups, quasiprimitive groups and innately
transitive groups.The latter three classes of groups of rank $3$ have been
classified, forming significant progresses on the long-standing problem of
classifying permutation groups of rank $3$.In this paper, a complete
classification is given of finite semiprimitive groups of rank $3$ that are not
innately transitive, examples of which are certain Schur coverings of certain
almost simple $2$-transitive groups, and three exceptional small groups.

In this short note we report on a coincidence of two mathematical quantities
that, at first glance, have little to do with each other. On the one hand,
there are the Lebesgue constants of the Walsh function system that play an
important role in approximation theory, and on the other hand there is the star
discrepancy of the van der Corput sequence that plays a prominent role in
uniform distribution theory. Over the decades, these two quantities have been
examined in great detail independently of each other and important results have
been proven. Work in these areas has been carried out independently, but as we
show here, they actually coincide. Interestingly, many theorems have been
discovered in both areas independently, but some results have only been known

Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be seen
as discovering a mapping from measurement data to unknown quantities, often
framed within an operator learning approach. However, existing methods
typically rely on large amounts of labeled training data, which is impractical
for most real-world applications. Moreover, these supervised models may fail to
capture the underlying physical principles accurately. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Physics-Informed Deep
Inverse Operator Networks (PI-DIONs), which can learn the solution operator of
PDE-based inverse problems without labeled training data. We extend the
stability estimates established in the inverse problem literature to the
operator learning framework, thereby providing a robust theoretical foundation
for our method. These estimates guarantee that the proposed model, trained on a
finite sample and grid, generalizes effectively across the entire domain and
function space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that
PI-DIONs can effectively and accurately learn the solution operators of the
inverse problems without the need for labeled data.

This is the companion paper of the letter arXiv:2410.15695, containing all
the details and series of examples on a 4d mirror symmetry for the
class-$\mathcal{S}$ theories which relates the representation theory of the
chiral quantization of the Higgs branch and the geometry of the Coulomb branch.
We study the representation theory by using the 4d/VOA correspondence, (defect)
Schur indices and (flavor) modular differential equations, and match the data
with the fixed manifolds of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This correspondence
extends the connection between Higgs and Coulomb branch of Argyres-Douglas
theories, and can provide systematic guidance for the study of the
representation theory of vertex operator algebras by exploiting results from
Hitchin systems.

Based on the development in dealing with nonlocal boundary conditions, we
propose a seamless local-nonlocal coupling diffusion model in this paper. In
our model, a finite constant interaction horizon is equipped in the nonlocal
part and transmission conditions are imposed on a co-dimension one interface.
To achieve a seamless coupling, we introduce an auxiliary function to merge the
nonlocal model with the local part and design a proper coupling transmission
condition to ensure the stability and convergence. In addition, by introducing
bilinear form, well-posedness of the proposed model can be proved and
convergence to a standard elliptic transmission model with first order in $H^1$
norm can be derived.

Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field of characteristic $\neq 2$ and $3$, let $V$ be a
$\mathbb{F}$-vector space of dimension $6$, and let $\Omega \in \wedge ^2V^\ast
$ be a non-degenerate form. A system of generators for polynomial invariant
functions under the tensorial action of the group $Sp(\Omega )$ on $\wedge ^3
V^\ast $, is given explicitly. Applications of these results to the normal
forms of De Bruyn-Kwiatkowski and Popov are given.

Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for
optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications,
including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the
proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp
algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its
worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially
composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a
hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an
efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially
composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we
present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its
exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert
pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one
sequential composition.

The aim of this paper is to study degenerate Eulerian polynomials and
degenerate Eulerian numbers, respectively as degenerate versions of the
Eulerian polynomials and the Eulerian numbers, and to derive some of their
properties. Specifically, we derive an identity, recursive relations,
generating function and degenerate version of Worpitzky's identity for the
degenerate Eulerian polynomials and numbers. In addition, we obtain several
results involving the degenerate Stirling numbers of the second kind and the
degenerate Bernoulli numbers as well as the degenerate Eulerian numbers.

Matrix valued orthogonal polynomials (MVOP) appear in the study of doubly
periodic tiling models. Of particular interest is their limiting behavior as
the degree tends to infinity. In recent years, MVOP associated with doubly
periodic domino tilings of the Aztec diamond have been successfully analyzed.
The MVOP related to doubly periodic lozenge tilings of a hexagon are more
complicated. In this paper we focus on a special subclass of hexagon tilings
with 3x3 periodicity. The special subclass leads to a genus one spectral curve
with additional symmetries that allow us to find an equilibrium measure in an
external field explicitly. The equilibrium measure gives the asymptotic
distribution for the zeros of the determinant of the MVOP. The associated
g-functions appear in the strong asymptotic formula for the MVOP that we obtain
from a steepest descent analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for MVOP.

Assuming Calabi symmetry, we prove that a numerical condition ensures the
solvability of the complex $(k,l)$-Hessian equation, as conjectured by
Sz\'ekelyhidi. We also propose a conjecture on the existence of a
$k$-subharmonic representative in a given cohomology class and confirm it under
the assumption of Calabi symmetry or when the class is semiample.

We show that the numerators of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series are
the (transpose of the) matrix of $q,t$-Kostka Macdonald coefficients $K_d =
\left( K_{\lambda \mu} \left( q,t \right) \right)_{\lambda, \mu \in
\mathcal{P}_d}$ for partitions $\lambda = \mu$ in the set of partitions
$\mathcal{P}_d$ of odd positive numbers $d$ with $d=2n-1$ and $n \in
\mathbb{N}$, such that $\lambda = \mu = \left( 1 \right)$ if $n=1$, and
$\lambda = \mu = \left( n, 1^{n-1} \right)$ if $n > 1$. These polynomials are
also shown to be eigenvalues of a differential operator arising from a
recurrence relation and acting on the Hilbert series.

Compressive Robust Principal Component Analysis (CRPCA) naturally arises in
various applications as a means to recover a low-rank matrix low-rank matrix
$\boldsymbol{L}$ and a sparse matrix $\boldsymbol{S}$ from compressive
measurements. In this paper, we approach the problem from a Bayesian inference
perspective. We establish a probabilistic model for the problem and develop an
improved turbo message passing (ITMP) algorithm based on the sum-product rule
and the appropriate approximations. Additionally, we establish a state
evolution framework to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the ITMP
algorithm in the large-system limit. By analyzing the established state
evolution, we further propose sufficient conditions for the global convergence
of our algorithm. Our numerical results validate the theoretical results,
demonstrating that the proposed asymptotic framework accurately characterize
the dynamical behavior of the ITMP algorithm, and the phase transition curve
specified by the sufficient condition agrees well with numerical simulations.

Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision
quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication
systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation
is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework
for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate
a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we
introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address
the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations
on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle
swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding
convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore,
we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite
impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical
examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed
framework to the existing algorithms.

This paper contributes to the theory of singularities of meromorphic linear
ODEs in traceless $2\times2$ cases, focusing on their deformations and
confluences.
  It is divided into two parts:
  The first part addresses individual singularities without imposing
restrictions on their type or degeneracy. The main result establishes a
correspondence between local formal invariants and jets of meromorphic
quadratic differentials. This result is then utilized to describe the parameter
space of universal isomonodromic deformation of meromorphic
$\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-connections over Riemann surfaces.
  The second part examines the confluence of singularities in a fully general
setting, accommodating all forms of degeneracies. It explores the relationship
between the geometry of the unfolded Stokes phenomenon and the horizontal and
vertical foliations of parametric families of quadratic differentials. The
local moduli space is naturally identified with a specific space of local
monodromy and Stokes data, presented as a space of representations of certain
fundamental groupoids associated with the foliations. This is then used for
studying degenerations of isomonodromic deformations in parametric families.

Mobile target tracking is crucial in various applications such as
surveillance and autonomous navigation. This study presents a decentralized
tracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF)
integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving
target's state. The framework facilitates agents in a network to
collaboratively estimate the target's position by sharing local observations
and achieving consensus despite communication constraints and measurement
noise. A saturation-based filtering technique is employed to enhance robustness
by mitigating the impact of noisy sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively reduces the Mean Squared Estimation Error
(MSEE) over time, indicating improved estimation accuracy and reliability. The
findings underscore the effectiveness of the CBEF in decentralized
environments, highlighting its scalability and resilience in the presence of
uncertainties.

Recently, the question of whether surjective maps preserving the norm of a
symmetric Kubo-Ando mean can be extended to Jordan $\ast$-isomorphisms has been
tackled. The question was affirmatively answered for surjective maps between
$C^{*}$-algebras for certain specific classes of symmetric Kubo-Ando means.
Here, we give a comprehensive answer to this question for surjective maps
between $AW^{*}$-algebras preserving the norm of any symmetric Kubo-Ando mean.

We consider damped wave equations with a potential and rotational inertia
terms. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the one dimensional
Euclidean space and we obtain fast energy decay and L^2-decay of the solution
itself as time goes to infinity. Since we are considering this problem in the
one dimensional space, we have no useful tools such as the Hardy and/or
Poincar\'e inequalities. This causes significant difficulties to derive the
decay property of the solution and the energy. A potential term will play a
role for compensating these weak points.

Let $\nu_y(n)$ denote the number of distinct prime factors of $n$ that are
  $<y$. For $k$ a positive integer, and for $k+2\leq y\leq x$, let
$S_{-k}(x,y)$ denote the sum \begin{eqnarray*} S_{-k}(x,y):=\sum_{n\leq
x}(-k)^{\nu_y(n)}. \end{eqnarray*} In this paper, we describe our recent
results on the asymptotic behavior of $S_{-k}(x,y)$ for $k+2\leq y\leq x$, and
$x$ sufficiently large. There is a crucial difference in the asymptotic
behavior of $S_{-k}(x,y)$ when $k+1$ is a prime and $k+1$ is composite, and
this makes the problem particularly interesting. The results are derived
utilizing a combination of the Buchstab-de Bruijn recurrence, the Perron
contour integral method, and certain difference-differential equations. We
present a summary of our results against the background of earlier work of the
first author on sums of the M\"{o}bius function over integers with restricted
prime factors and on a multiplicative generalization of the sieve.

We consider polynomials of the form
$\operatorname{h}_m(y_1^{[\varkappa_1]},\ldots,y_n^{[\varkappa_n]})$, where
$\operatorname{h}_m$ is the complete homogeneous polynomial of degree $m$ and
$y_j^{[\varkappa_j]}$ denotes $y_j$ repeated $\varkappa_j$ times. Using the
decomposition of the generating function into partial fractions we represent
such polynomials in the form \[
\operatorname{h}_m(y_1^{[\varkappa_1]},\ldots,y_n^{[\varkappa_n]})
=\sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{r=1}^{\varkappa_j} \binom{r+m-1}{r-1} A_{y,\varkappa,j,r}
y_j^m, \] where $A_{y,\varkappa,j,r}$ are some coefficients that do not depend
on $m$. We also provide an alternative proof using the inverse of the confluent
Vandermonde matrix.

G.A. Galperin introduced the axiomatic mass center system for finite point
sets in spherical and hyperbolic spaces, proving the uniqueness of the mass
center system. In this paper, we revisit this system and provide a
significantly simpler proof of its uniqueness. Furthermore, we extend the
axiomatic mass center system to manifolds. As an application of our system, we
derive a highly generalized version of Pappus' centroid theorem for volumes in
three geometries - Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic - across all
dimensions, offering unified and notably simple proofs for all three
geometries.

Meeting the high data rate demands of modern applications necessitates the
utilization of high-frequency spectrum bands, including millimeter-wave and
sub-terahertz bands. However, these frequencies require precise alignment of
narrow communication beams between transmitters and receivers, typically
resulting in significant beam training overhead. This paper introduces a novel
end-to-end vision-aided beamforming framework that utilizes images to predict
optimal beams while considering geometric adjustments to reduce overhead. Our
model demonstrates robust adaptability to dynamic environments without relying
on additional training data where the experimental results indicate a top-5
beam prediction accuracy of 98.96%, significantly surpassing current
state-of-the-art solutions in vision-aided beamforming.

We find that non-hyperelliptic generalised Howe curves and their twists of
genus 5 attain the Hasse-Weil-Serre bound over some finite fields of order p,
p^2 or p^3 for a prime p. We are able to decompose their Jacobians completely
under certain assumptions and to determine the precise condition on the finite
field over which they attain the Hasse-Weil-Serre bound.

We investigate stochastic utility maximization games under relative
performance concerns in both finite-agent and infinite-agent (graphon)
settings. An incomplete market model is considered where agents with power
(CRRA) utility functions trade in a common risk-free bond and individual stocks
driven by both common and idiosyncratic noise. The Nash equilibrium for both
settings is characterized by forward-backward stochastic differential equations
(FBSDEs) with a quadratic growth generator, where the solution of the graphon
game leads to a novel form of infinite-dimensional McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs. Under
mild conditions, we prove the existence of Nash equilibrium for both the
graphon game and the $n$-agent game without common noise. Furthermore, we
establish a convergence result showing that, with modest assumptions on the
sensitivity matrix, as the number of agents increases, the Nash equilibrium and
associated equilibrium value of the finite-agent game converge to those of the
graphon game.

We continue the study of the geometry of infinite geodesics in first passage
percolation (FPP) on Gromov-hyperbolic groups G, initiated by Benjamini-Tessera
and developed further by the authors. It was shown earlier by the authors that,
given any fixed direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and under mild conditions on the
passage time distribution, there exists almost surely a unique semi-infinite
FPP geodesic from each $v\in G$ to $\xi$. Also, these geodesics coalesce to
form a tree. Our main topic of study is the set of (random) exceptional
directions for which uniqueness or coalescence fails. We study these directions
in the context of two random geodesics trees: one formed by the union of all
geodesics starting at a given base point, and the other formed by the union of
all semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction $\xi\in \partial G$. We show
that, under mild conditions, the set of exceptional directions almost surely
has a strictly smaller Hausdorff dimension than the boundary, and hence has
measure zero with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. We also establish
an upper bound on the maximum number of disjoint geodesics in the same
direction. For groups that are not virtually free, we show that almost surely
exceptional directions exist and are dense in $\partial G$. When the
topological dimension of $\partial G$ is greater than one, we establish the
existence of uncountably many exceptional directions. When the topological
dimension of $\partial G$ is $n$, we prove the existence of directions $\xi$
with at least $(n+1)$ disjoint geodesics. The questions answered here have been
considered before for FPP on euclidean lattices, but have only been
satisfactorily answered for planar exactly solvable models of last passage
percolation. Our results exhibit new features in higher dimensions.

Mutual-visibility sets were motivated by visibility in distributed systems
and social networks, and intertwine with several classical mathematical areas.
Monotone properties of the variety of mutual-visibility sets, and restrictions
of such sets to convex and isometric subgraphs are studied. Dual
mutual-visibility sets are shown to be intrinsically different from other types
of mutual-visibility sets. It is proved that for every finite subset $Z$ of
positive integers there exists a graph $G$ that has a dual mutual-visibility
set of size $i$ if and only if $i\in Z\cup \{0\}$, while for the other types of
mutual-visibility such a set consists of consecutive integers. Visibility
polynomials are introduced and their properties derived. As a surprise, every
polynomial with nonnegative integer coefficients and with a constant term $1$
is a dual visibility polynomial of some graph. Characterizations are given for
total mutual-visibility sets, for graphs with total mutual-visibility number
$1$, and for sets which are not total mutual-visibility sets, yet every proper
subset is such. Along the way an earlier result from the literature is
corrected.

A regular bipartite graph $\Gamma$ is called semisymmetric if its full
automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ acts transitively on the edge set but
not on the vertex set. For a subgroup $G$ of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ that
stabilizes the biparts of $\Gamma$, we say that $\Gamma$ is $G$-biprimitive if
$G$ acts primitively on each part. In this paper, we first provide a method to
construct infinite families of biprimitive semisymmetric graphs admitting
almost simple groups. With the aid of this result, a classification of
$G$-biprimitive semisymmetric graphs is obtained for $G=\mathrm{A}_n$ or
$\mathrm{S}_n$. In pursuit of this goal, we determine all pairs of maximal
subgroups of $\mathrm{A}_n$ or $\mathrm{S}_n$ with the same order and all pairs
of almost simple groups of the same order.

We consider the positive parts $U_q^{+}$ of the quantum affine superalgebra
$U_q(C(2)^{(2)})$ and the quantum admissible affine algebra
$\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{s l}}_2)$ newly defined in \cite{HZ}, which
both have presentations with two generators $e_{\alpha}, e_{\delta-\alpha}$
that satisfy the cubic $q$-Serre relations. There are the Damiani and the Beck
$PBW$ bases for those two algebras due to Khoroshkin-Lukierski-Tolstoy and
Hu-Zhuang, respectively. In this paper, we use $q$-shuffle algebras and Catalan
words to express those two bases in closed form. Finally, the equitable
presentations of $U_q(C(2)^{(2)})$ and $\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{s
l}}_2)$ are exhibited.

For a nonprincipal character $\chi$ modulo $D$, when $x\ge
D^{\frac56+\varepsilon}$, $(l,D) = 1$, we prove a nontrivial estimate of the
form $\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda (n)\chi (n-l)\ll x\exp\left(-0.6\sqrt{\ln D}\right)$
for the sum of values of $\chi$ over a sequence of shifted primes.

In this article, we study the density conjecture of Katz and Sarnak for
$L$-functions of ad\'elic Hilbert modular forms and their convolutions. In
particular, under the generalised Riemann hypothesis, we establish several
instances supporting the conjecture and extending the works of
Iwaniec-Luo-Sarnak and many others. For applications, we obtain an upper bound
for the average order of $L$-functions of Hilbert modular forms at
$s=\frac{1}{2}$ as well as a positive proportion of non-vanishing of certain
Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions.

We prove the ACC for minimal log discrepancies on an arbitrary fixed
threefold.

We study an optimal control problem encompassing investment, consumption, and
retirement decisions under exponential (CARA-type) utility. The financial
market comprises a bond with constant drift and a stock following geometric
Brownian motion. The agent receives continuous income, consumes over time, and
has the option to retire irreversibly, gaining increased leisure
post-retirement compared to pre-retirement. The objective is to maximize the
expected exponential utility of weighted consumption and leisure over an
infinite horizon. Using a martingale approach and dual value function, we
derive implicit solutions for the optimal portfolio, consumption, and
retirement time. The analysis highlights key contributions: first, the
equivalent condition for no retirement is characterized by a specific income
threshold; second, the influence of income and leisure levels on optimal
portfolio, consumption, and retirement decisions is thoroughly examined. These
results provide valuable insights into the interplay between financial and
lifestyle choices in retirement planning.

For a given positive integer $m$, the concept of {\it hyperdeterminantal
total positivity} is defined for a kernel $K:\R^{2m} \to \R$, thereby
generalizing the classical concept of total positivity. Extending the
fundamental example, $K(x,y) = \exp(xy)$, $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, of a classical
totally positive kernel, the hyperdeterminantal total positivity property of
the kernel $K(x_1,\ldots,x_{2m}) = \exp(x_1\cdots x_{2m})$, $x_1,\ldots,x_{2m}
\in \mathbb{R}$ is established. A hyperdeterminantal Binet-Cauchy argument is
applied to derive a generalization of Karlin's Basic Composition Formula, from
which several examples of hyperdeterminantal totally positive kernels are
constructed. Further generalizations of hyperdeterminantal total positivity by
means of the theory of finite reflection groups are described and some open
problems are posed.

In an earlier note [arXiv:2301.00295] it was shown that there is an upper
bound to the number of disjoint Hopf links (and certain related links) that can
be imbedded in the unit cube where there is a fixed separation required between
the components within each copy of the Hopf link. The arguments relied on
multi-linear properties of linking number and certain other link invariants.
Here we produce a very similar upper bound for all non-trivial links by a
more-general, entirely geometric, argument (but one which, unlike the original,
has no analog in higher dimensions). Shortly after the initial paper,
[arXiv:2308.08064] proved that our upper bounds were also, effectively, lower
bounds. Lower bounds are still open in the broader context.

This work presents a data-driven Koopman operator-based modeling method using
a model averaging technique. While the Koopman operator has been used for
data-driven modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics, it is challenging to
accurately reconstruct unknown dynamics from data and perform different
decision-making tasks, mainly due to its infinite dimensionality and difficulty
of finding invariant subspaces. We utilize ideas from a Bayesian
inference-based model averaging technique to devise a data-driven method that
first populates multiple Koopman models starting with a feature extraction
using neural networks and then computes point estimates of the posterior of
predicted variables. Although each model in the ensemble is not likely to be
accurate enough for a wide range of operating points or unseen data, the
proposed weighted linear embedding model combines the outputs of model ensemble
aiming at compensating the modeling error of each model so that the overall
performance will be improved.

This paper develops a methodology for adaptive data-driven Model Predictive
Control (MPC) using Koopman operators. While MPC is ubiquitous in various
fields of engineering, the controller performance can deteriorate if the
modeling error between the control model and the true dynamics persists, which
may often be the case with complex nonlinear dynamics. Adaptive MPC techniques
learn models online such that the controller can compensate for the modeling
error by incorporating newly available data. We utilize the Koopman operator
framework to formulate an adaptive MPC technique that corrects for model
discrepancies in a computationally efficient manner by virtue of convex
optimization. With the use of neural networks to learn embedding spaces,
Koopman operator models enable accurate dynamics modeling. Such complex model
forms, however, often lead to unstable online learning. To this end, the
proposed method utilizes the soft update of target networks, a technique used
in stabilization of model learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Also, we
provide a discussion on which parameters to be chosen as online updated
parameters based on a specific description of linear embedding models.
Numerical simulations on a canonical nonlinear dynamical system show that the
proposed method performs favorably compared to other data-driven MPC methods
while achieving superior computational efficiency through the utilization of
Koopman operators.

For a system of partial differential equations that has an extended
Kovalevskaya form, a reduction procedure is presented that allows one to use a
local (point, contact, or higher) symmetry of a system and a symmetry-invariant
conservation law to algorithmically calculate constants of motion holding for
symmetry-invariant solutions. Several examples including cases of point and
higher symmetry invariance are presented and discussed. An implementation of
the algorithm in Maple is provided.

We generalize the seminal polynomial partitioning theorems of Guth and Katz
to a set of semi-Pfaffian sets. Specifically, given a set $\Gamma \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\gamma \in
\Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian
function is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\vec{q}$ of
length $r$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \in
\mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected
component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\sim
\frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. Also, for any $D \ge 1$,
we prove the existence of a Pfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$
defined with respect to $\vec{q}$, such that each connected component of
$\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P')$ intersects at most $\sim
\frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. To do so, given a
$k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and a
polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we
establish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of
$\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ that $\mathcal{X}$ intersects; i.e. we prove that
the number of connected components of $(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)) \cap
\mathcal{X}$ is at most $\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive
Pfaffian versions of Szemer\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds
on the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.

While dealing with the J-Matrix method for the harmonic oscillator to write
down its tridiagonal matrix representation in an orthonormal basis of L2(R); we
rederive a set of generalized coherent states (GCS) of Perelomov type labeled
by points z of the complex plane C and depending on a positive integer number m
The number states expansion of these GCS gives rise to coefficients that are
complex Hermite polynomials whose linear superpositions provide eigenfunctions
for the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian associated with the mth Landau
level. We extend this procedure to the Morse oscillator by constructing a new
set of GCS of Glauber type.

For the two dimensional Allen-Cahn system with a triple-well potential,
previous results established the existence of a minimizing solution
$u:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ with a triple junction structure at
infinity. We show that along each of three sharp interfaces, $u$ is
asymptotically invariant in the direction of the interface and can be
well-approximated by the 1D heteroclinic connections between two phases.
Consequently, the diffuse interface is located in an $O(1)$ neighborhood of the
sharp interface, and becomes nearly flat at infinity. This generalizes all the
results for the triple junction solution with symmetry hypotheses to the
non-symmetric case. The proof relies on refined sharp energy lower and upper
bounds, alongside a precise estimate of the diffuse interface location.

We study an almost periodic version of a metapopulation model developed by
Tilman \textit{et.al} and Nee \textit{et.al} in the nineties, which generalizes
the classical Levins approach by considering several species in competition
affected by habitat destruction. The novelty is to assume that the colonization
and extinction rates are positive almost periodic functions whereas our main
results show that the predominance of either colonization or extinction forces
of a specific species is equivalent to the property of exponential dichotomy of
a scalar linear differential equation. By using well known results of
exponential dichotomy theory, we carry out a recursive and exhaustive
description of persistence/extinction scenarios. In addition, we start a
preliminary discussion describing a more elusive behavior when the colonization
and extinction forces are similar in average.

We provide a general method to convert a "primal" black-box algorithm for
solving regularized convex-concave minimax optimization problems into an
algorithm for solving the associated dual maximin optimization problem. Our
method adds recursive regularization over a logarithmic number of rounds where
each round consists of an approximate regularized primal optimization followed
by the computation of a dual best response. We apply this result to obtain new
state-of-the-art runtimes for solving matrix games in specific parameter
regimes, obtain improved query complexity for solving the dual of the CVaR
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, and recover the optimal
query complexity for finding a stationary point of a convex function.

We study properties of causal couplings for probability measures on the space
of continuous functions. We first provide a characterization of bicausal
couplings between weak solutions of stochastic differential equations. We then
provide a complete description of all such bicausal Monge couplings. In
particular, we show that bicausal Monge couplings of $d$-dimensional Wiener
measures are induced by stochastic integrals of rotation-valued integrands. As
an application, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for bicausal
couplings to be induced by Monge maps and show that such bicausal Monge
transports are dense in the set of bicausal couplings between laws of SDEs with
regular coefficients.

In this article, we prove the decay estimate for the discrete Schr\"odinger
equation (DS) on the hexagonal triangulation. The $l^1\rightarrow l^\infty$
dispersive decay rate is $\left\langle t\right\rangle^{-\frac{3}{4}}$, which is
faster than the decay rate of DS on the 2-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$,
which is $\left\langle t\right\rangle^{-\frac{2}{3}}$, see [32]. The proof
relies on the detailed analysis of singularities of the corresponding phase
function and the theory of uniform estimates on oscillatory integrals developed
by Karpushkin [15]. Moreover, we prove the Strichartz estimate and give an
application to the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS) on the
hexagonal triangulation.

We prove a Geroch type result for isolated conical singularity. Namely, we
show that there is no Riemannian metric $g$ on $ X \# T^n $ with an isolated
conical singularity which has nonnegative scalar curvature on the regular part,
and is positive at some point. In particular, this implies that there is no
metric on tori with an isolated conical singularity and positive scalar
curvature. We also prove that a scalar flat Riemannian metric $g$ on $X \# T^n$
with finitely many isolated conical singularities must be flat, and extend
smoothly across the singular points. We do not a priori assume that a conically
singular point on $X$ is a manifold point; i.e., the cross section of the
conical singularity may not be spherical.

This paper investigates the number of supports of the Schubert polynomial
$\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ indexed by a permutation $w$. This number also equals the
number of lattice points in the Newton polytope of $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$. We
establish a lower bound for this number in terms of the occurrences of patterns
in $w$. The analysis is carried out in the general framework of dual characters
of flagged Weyl modules. Our result considerably improves the bounds for
principal specializations of Schubert polynomials or dual flagged Weyl
characters previously obtained by Weigandt, Gao, and M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros--St.
Dizier--Tanjaya. Some problems and conjectures are discussed.

In this paper, we investigate the concentration behaviors of ground states to
stationary Mean-field Games systems (MFGs) with the nonlocal coupling in
$\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq 2.$ With the mass critical exponent imposed on Riesz
potentials, we first discuss the existence of ground states to potential-free
MFGs, which corresponds to the establishment of Gagliardo-Nirenberg type's
inequality. Next, with the aid of the optimal inequality, we classify the
existence of ground states to stationary MFGs with Hartree-type coupling in
terms of the $L^1$-norm of population density defined by $M$. In addition,
under certain types of coercive potentials, the asymptotics of ground states to
ergodic MFGs with the nonlocal coupling are captured. Moreover, if the local
polynomial expansions are imposed on potentials, we study the refined
asymptotic behaviors of ground states and show that they concentrate on the
flattest minima of potentials.

The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in
two dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy
flux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on
probability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal
field theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be
averaged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging
function. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which
include the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy
flux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the
distribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the
flux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct
from the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint
distribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution
of energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy
density. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on
the energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be
discussed.

We introduce a class of equivariant vector bundles on isotropic symplectic
Grassmannians $\mathrm{IGr}(k,2n)$ defined as appropriate truncations of
staircase complexes and show that these bundles can be assembled into a number
of complexes quasi-isomorphic to the symplectic wedge powers of the symplectic
bundle on $\mathrm{IGr}(k,2n)$. We are planning to use these secondary
staircase complexes to study fullness of exceptional collections in the derived
categories of isotropic Grassmannians and Lefschetz exceptional collections on
$\mathrm{IGr}(3,2n)$.

In this work, we investigate the problem of the boundedness of the Gross'
solutions of the planar Skorokhod embedding problem, where we show that the
solution is bounded under some mild conditions on the underlying probability
distribution.

The aim of this article is to investigate the presence of a conformal vector
$\xi$ with conformal factor $\rho$ on a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ with or
without boundary $\partial M$. We firstly prove that a compact Riemannian
manifold $(M^n, g)\,,n \geq 3,$ with constant scalar curvature, with boundary
$\partial M$ totally geodesic, in such way that the traceless Ricci curvature
is zero in the direction of $\nabla \rho,$ is isometric to a standard
hemisphere. In the $4$-dimensional case, under the condition
$\displaystyle\int_M|\mathring{Ric}|^2\langle \xi,\nabla \rho\rangle
\,dM\leq0$, we show that, either $M$ is isometric to a standard sphere, or $M$
is isometric to a standard hemisphere. Finally, we give a partial answer for
the cosmic no-hair conjecture.

We present explicit representations in terms of hypergeometric functions for
the scaling functions in the $C^0$ orthogonal multiresolution analyses
associated with piecewise continuous polynomials. Closed formulas for the
Mellin transform of these functions as well as their Fourier transforms are
derived. Some new multiresolution analyses whose scaling functions have
coefficients that are rational numbers are introduced and discussed.

What use can there be for a function from the $p$-adic numbers to the
$q$-adic numbers, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes? The traditional
answer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of non-archimedean functional
analysis: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature.
'$\left(p,q\right)$-adic analysis' of this sort appears to be naturally suited
for studying the infamous Collatz map and similar arithmetical dynamical
systems. Given such a map $H:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$, one can
construct a function $\chi_{H}:\mathbb{Z}_{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{q}$ for an
appropriate choice of distinct primes $p,q$ with the property that
$x\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash\left\{ 0\right\} $ is a periodic point of $H$ if and
only if there is a $p$-adic integer
$\mathfrak{z}\in\left(\mathbb{Q}\cap\mathbb{Z}_{p}\right)\backslash\left\{
0,1,2,\ldots\right\} $ so that $\chi_{H}\left(\mathfrak{z}\right)=x$. By
generalizing Monna-Springer integration theory and establishing a
$\left(p,q\right)$-adic analogue of the Wiener Tauberian Theorem, one can show
that the question 'is $x\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash\left\{ 0\right\} $ a periodic
point of $H$?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of
the Fourier transform of $\chi_{H}\left(\mathfrak{z}\right)-x$ dense in an
appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new
frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study
Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ for any
$d\geq1$.

We exhibit how the Hodge-Deligne moduli space of $\lambda$-connections over a
smooth projective curve, for stable bundles with fixed determinant, can be
understood as the dual of the Atiyah algebroid of the determinant of cohomology
line bundle.

We construct a "Hitchin-type" connection on bundles of non-abelian theta
functions on higher-rank Prym varieties, for unramified double covers of
curves. We formulate a version of level-rank duality in this Prym setting
(building on work of Zelaci), show it holds for level one, and establish that
the duality respects the flat connections at all levels.

Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for describing, predicting, and
understanding complex phenomena exhibited by real-world systems. However,
identifying the equations that govern a system's dynamics from experimental
data remains a significant challenge without a definitive solution. In this
study, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate the
governing equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The main
approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and
subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of
the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the
genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism
to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we
applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and
the Lorenz system. Our results demonstrate a reconstruction with an Integral
Square Error below 0.22 and a coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.99
for all systems, indicating successful reconstruction of the governing dynamic
equations.

Following the research from the paper ``Triangles, squares and geodesics''
(arXiv:0910.5688) of Rena Levitt and Jon McCammond we investigate the
properties of groups acting on CAT(0) triangle-square complexes, focusing
mostly on biautomaticity of such groups. In particular we show two examples of
nonpositively curved triangle-square complexes $X_1$ and $X_2$, such that their
universal covers violate conjectures given in the aforementioned paper. This
shows that the Gersten-Short geodesics cannot be used as a way of proving
biautomaticity of groups acting on such complexes. Lastly we give a proof of
biautomaticity of $\pi_1(X_1)$, however the biautomaticity of $\pi_1(X_2)$
remains unknown.

Optimal contribution selection (OCS) is a selective breeding method that
manages the conversion of genetic variation into genetic gain to facilitate
short-term competitiveness and long-term sustainability in breeding programmes.
Traditional approaches to OCS do not account for uncertainty in input data,
which is always present and challenges optimization and practical decision
making. Here we use concepts from robust optimization to derive a robust OCS
problem and develop two ways to solve the problem using either conic
optimization or sequential quadratic programming. We have developed the
open-source Python package 'robustocs' that leverages the Gurobi and HiGHS
solvers to carry out these methods. Our testing shows favourable performance
when solving the robust OCS problem using sequential quadratic programming and
the HiGHS solver.

Geodesic nets are types of graphs in Riemannian manifolds where each edge is
a geodesic segment. One important object used in the construction of geodesic
nets is a balanced vertex, where the sum of unit tangent vectors along adjacent
edges is zero. In 2021, Parsch proved the upper bound for the number of
balanced vertices of a geodesic net with three unbalanced vertices on surfaces
with non-positive curvature. We extend his result by proving the existence of a
balanced vertex of a triangle (with three unbalanced vertices) on any
two-dimensional surface when all angles measure less than $2\pi/3$, if the
length of the sides of the triangle are not too large. This property is also a
generalization for the existence of the Fermat point of a planar triangle.

For fixed $d\geq 3$, we construct subsets of the $d$-dimensional lattice cube
$[n]^d$ of size $n^{\frac{3}{d + 1} - o(1)}$ with no $d+2$ points on a sphere
or a hyperplane. This improves the previously best known bound of
$\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{d-1}})$ due to Thiele from 1995.

In this paper, we prove a self-improvement result for $(\theta,p)$-fractional
Hardy inequalities, in both the exponent $1<p<\infty$ and the regularity
parameter $0<\theta<1$, for bounded domains in doubling metric measure spaces.
The key conceptual tool is a Caffarelli-Silvestre-type argument, which relates
fractional Sobolev spaces on $Z$ to Newton-Sobolev spaces in the hyperbolic
filling $\overline{X}_{\varepsilon}$ of $Z$ via trace results. Using this
insight, it is shown that a fractional Hardy inequality in an open subset of
$Z$ is equivalent to a classical Hardy inequality in the filling
$\overline{X}_{\varepsilon}$. The main result is then obtained by applying a
new weighted self-improvement result for $p$-Hardy inequalities. The exponent
$p$ can be self-improved by a classical Koskela-Zhong argument, but a new
theory of regularizable weights is developed to obtain the self-improvement in
the regularity parameter $\theta$. This generalizes a result of Lehrb\"ack and
Koskela on self-improvement of $d_\Omega^\beta$-weighted $p$-Hardy inequalities
by allowing a much broader class of weights. Using the equivalence of
fractional Hardy inequalities with Hardy inequalities in the fillings, we also
give new examples of domains satisfying fractional Hardy inequalities.

A general solution for a coupled system of eikonal equations $u_\mu u_\mu
=0$, $v_\mu v_\mu =0$, $u_\mu v_\mu =1$ is presented, where lower indices
designate derivatives, $\mu=0,1,2,3$, and summation is implied over the
repeated indices. This solution is of interest by itself due to wide
applications of the eikonal equations, but the system considered also appears
to be part of the reduction conditions for many equations of mathematical
physics.

The purpose of this paper is to consider the application of the direct
interaction approximation (DIA) developed by Kraichnan to generalized
stochastic models in the turbulence problem. Previous developments (Kraichnan,
Shivamoggi et al., Shivamoggi and Tuovila) were based on the Boltzmann-Gibbs
prescription for the underlying entropy measure, which exhibits the extensivity
property and is suited for ergodic systems. Here, we consider the introduction
of an influence bias discriminating rare and frequent events explicitly, as
behooves non-ergodic systems. More specifically, we consider the application of
the DIA to a linear damped stochastic oscillator system using a Tsallis type
autocorrelation model with an underlying non-extensive entropy measure, and
describe the resulting stochastic process. We also deduce some apparently novel
mathematical properties of the stochastic models associated with the present
investigation -- the gamma distribution and the Tsallis non-extensive entropy.

Under suitable conditions on a family of logarithmic curves, we endow the
tropicalization of the family with an affine structure in a neighborhood of the
sections in such a way that the tropical $\psi$ classes from \cite{psi-classes}
arise as tropicalizations of algebraic $\psi$ classes.

Data-driven techniques for analysis, modeling, and control of complex
dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical
foundation for the extremely popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition
(kEDMD). In this work we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear
control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. The main features of
the method are flexible sampling, regularization-based robustness, and an
adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids. In addition, we prove
proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled)
equilibrium, of the derived uniform bounds on the full approximation error.
Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of
the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the
original (control) system and vice versa.

Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for
identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an
infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability
guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under
conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within
the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we
propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and
Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of
data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively
low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed
high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system
transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov
functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified
using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less
conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing
methods.

Graphs serve as powerful tools for modeling pairwise interactions in diverse
fields such as biology, material science, and social networks. However, they
inherently overlook interactions involving more than two entities. Simplicial
complexes and hypergraphs have emerged as prominent frameworks for modeling
many-body interactions; nevertheless, they exhibit limitations in capturing
specific high-order interactions, particularly those involving transitions from
$n$-interactions to $m$-interactions. Addressing this gap, we propose
IntComplex as an innovative framework to characterize such high-order
interactions comprehensively. Our framework leverages homology theory to
provide a quantitative representation of the topological structure inherent in
such interactions. IntComplex is defined as a collection of interactions, each
of which can be equivalently represented by a binary tree. Drawing inspiration
from GLMY homology, we introduce homology for the detailed analysis of
structural patterns formed by interactions across adjacent dimensions,
$p$-layer homology to elucidate loop structures within $p$-interactions in
specific dimensions, and multilayer homology to analyze loop structures of
interactions across multiple dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce persistent
homology through a filtration process and establish its stability to ensure
robust quantitative analysis of these complex interactions. The proposed
IntComplex framework establishes a foundational paradigm for the analysis of
topological properties in high-order interactions, presenting significant
potential to drive forward the advancements in the domain of complex network
analysis.

A coloring of the vertex set of a graph using the colors red and blue is a
closed neighborhood balanced coloring if for each vertex there are an equal
number of red and blue vertices in its closed neighborhood. A graph with such a
coloring is called a CNBC graph. Freyberg and Marr studied the related class of
NBC graphs where closed neighborhood is replaced by open neighborhood. We prove
results about CNBC graphs and NBC graphs. We show that the class of CNBC graphs
is not hereditary, that the sizes of the color classes can be arbitrarily
different, and that if the sizes of the color classes are equal, then a graph
is a CNBC graph if and only if its complement is an NBC graph. When the sizes
of the color classes are equal, we show that the join of two CNBC graphs is a
CNBC graph, and the lexicographic product of a CNBC graph with any graph is a
CNBC graph. We prove that the Cartesian product of any CNBC graph and any NBC
graph is a CNBC graph, and characterize when a hypercube is an NBC graph or a
CNBC graph, but show that the product of two CNBC graphs need not be an NBC
graph. We show that the strong product of a CNBC graph with any graph is a CNBC
graph. We construct infinite families of circulants that are CNBC graphs, and
give characterizations of CNBC trees, generalized Petersen graphs, cubic
circulants and quintic circulants when $n\equiv 2 \pmod 4$.

Recently, there was a substantial progress in the problem of sampling
recovery on function classes with mixed smoothness. Mostly, it has been done by
proving new and sometimes optimal upper bounds for both linear sampling
recovery and for nonlinear sampling recovery. In this paper we address the
problem of lower bounds for the optimal rates of nonlinear sampling recovery.
  In the case of linear recovery one can use the well developed theory of
estimating the Kolmogorov and linear widths for establishing some lower bounds
for the optimal rates. In the case of nonlinear recovery we cannot use the
above approach. It seems like the only technique, which is available now, is
based on some simple observations. We demonstrate how these observations can be
used.

We study the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple
correlated networks, focusing on edge-correlated stochastic block models with
two balanced communities. Recent work of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT
2022) determined the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact
community recovery using two correlated graphs; in particular, this showcased
the subtle interplay between community recovery and graph matching. Here we
study the natural setting of more than two graphs. The main challenge lies in
understanding how to aggregate information across several graphs when none of
the pairwise latent vertex correspondences can be exactly recovered. Our main
result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community
recovery using any constant number of correlated graphs, answering a question
of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022). In particular, for every $K \geq 3$
we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact
community recovery is possible using $K$ correlated graphs, even though (1)
this is information-theoretically impossible using any $K-1$ of them and (2)
none of the latent matchings can be exactly recovered.

Alcoved polytopes are convex polytopes which are the closure of a union of
alcoves in an affine Coxeter arrangement. They are rational polytopes, and
therefore have Ehrhart quasipolynomials. We describe a method for computing the
generating function of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial, or Ehrhart series, of any
alcoved polytope via a particular shelling order of its alcoves. We also
conjecture a connection between Early's decorated ordered set partitions and
this shelling order for the hypersimplex $\Delta_{2,n}$.

We investigate the monotone representation and measurability of generalized
$\psi$-estimators introduced by the authors in 2022. Our first main result,
applying the unique existence of a generalized $\psi$-estimator, allows us to
construct this estimator in terms of a function $\psi$, which is decreasing in
its second variable. We then interpret this result as a bridge from a nonconvex
optimization problem to a convex one. Further, supposing that the underlying
measurable space (sample space) has a measurable diagonal and some additional
assumptions on $\psi$, we show that the measurability of a generalized
$\psi$-estimator is equivalent to the measurability of the corresponding
function $\psi$ in its first variable.

Non-convex Machine Learning problems typically do not adhere to the standard
smoothness assumption. Based on empirical findings, Zhang et al. (2020b)
proposed a more realistic generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness assumption,
though it remains largely unexplored. Many existing algorithms designed for
standard smooth problems need to be revised. However, in the context of
Federated Learning, only a few works address this problem but rely on
additional limiting assumptions. In this paper, we address this gap in the
literature: we propose and analyze new methods with local steps, partial
participation of clients, and Random Reshuffling without extra restrictive
assumptions beyond generalized smoothness. The proposed methods are based on
the proper interplay between clients' and server's stepsizes and gradient
clipping. Furthermore, we perform the first analysis of these methods under the
Polyak-{\L} ojasiewicz condition. Our theory is consistent with the known
results for standard smooth problems, and our experimental results support the
theoretical insights.

Given conflicting probability estimates for a set of events, how can we
quantify how much they conflict? How can we find a single probability
distribution that best encapsulates the given estimates? One approach is to
minimize a loss function such as binary KL-divergence that quantifies the
dissimilarity between the given estimates and the candidate probability
distribution. Given a set of events, we characterize the facets of the polytope
of coherent probability estimates about those events. We explore two
applications of these ideas: eliciting the beliefs of large language models,
and merging expert forecasts into a single coherent forecast.

In Bayesian inverse problems, it is common to consider several
hyperparameters that define the prior and the noise model that must be
estimated from the data. In particular, we are interested in linear inverse
problems with additive Gaussian noise and Gaussian priors defined using
Mat\'{e}rn covariance models. In this case, we estimate the hyperparameters
using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the marginalized posterior
distribution. However, this is a computationally intensive task since it
involves computing log determinants. To address this challenge, we consider a
stochastic average approximation (SAA) of the objective function and use the
preconditioned Lanczos method to compute efficient approximations of the
function and gradient evaluations. We propose a new preconditioner that can be
updated cheaply for new values of the hyperparameters and an approach to
compute approximations of the gradient evaluations, by reutilizing information
from the function evaluations. We demonstrate the performance of our approach
on static and dynamic seismic tomography problems.

In this paper, we present a method for calculation of spin groups elements
for known pseudo-orthogonal group elements with respect to the corresponding
two-sheeted coverings. We present our results using the Clifford algebra
formalism in the case of arbitrary dimension and signature, and then explicitly
using matrices, quaternions, and split-quaternions in the cases of all possible
signatures (p,q) of space up to dimension n=p+q=3. The different formalisms are
convenient for different possible applications in physics, engeneering, and
computer science.

We discuss the H\"older regularity of solutions to the semilinear equation
involving the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s u=f(u)$ in one dimension. We
put in evidence a new regularity phenomenon which is a combined effect of the
nonlocality and the semilinearity of the equation, since it does not happen
neither for local semilinear equations, nor for nonlocal linear equations.
Namely, for nonlinearities $f$ in $C^\beta$ and when $2s+\beta <1$, the
solution is not always $C^{2s+\beta-\epsilon}$ for all $\epsilon >0$. Instead,
in general the solution $u$ is at most $C^{2s/(1-\beta)}.$

In this paper, we address Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems through a
novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR
(EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a
truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given
policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system
matrices, cost matrices, and state measurements. In particular, at each
iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost
retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a
perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is
done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm
a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting
averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an
arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the
theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an
induction motor.

We study the conditions under which a subvariety of the Grassmannian may be
recovered from certain of its linear projections. In the special case that our
Grassmannian is projective space, this is equivalent to asking when a variety
can be recovered from its Chow form; the answer is "always" by work of Chow in
1937. In the general Grassmannian setting, the analogous question is when a
variety can be recovered from its Chow-Lam form. We give both necessary
conditions for recovery and families of examples where, in contrast with the
projective case, recovery is not possible.

It was conjectured by Tian that the global log canonical threshold (known as
the $\alpha$-invariant) is equal to the level $k$ log canonical threshold
(known as the $\alpha_k$-invariant) for all sufficiently large $k$. A weaker
folklore conjecture has been that the invariants $\alpha_k$ are eventually
monotone. We provide a counterexample to both conjectures.

A key component of transformers is the attention mechanism orchestrating how
each token influences the propagation of every other token through a
transformer. In this paper we provide a rigorous, mathematical analysis of the
asymptotic properties of attention in transformers. Although we present several
results based on different assumptions, all of them point to the same
conclusion, all tokens asymptotically converge to each other, a phenomenon that
has been empirically reported in the literature. Our findings are carefully
compared with existing theoretical results and illustrated by simulations and
experimental studies using the GPT-2 model.

We introduce the notion of rank of multivector in Clifford geometric algebras
of arbitrary dimension without using the corresponding matrix representations
and using only geometric algebra operations. We use the concepts of
characteristic polynomial in geometric algebras and the method of SVD. The
results can be used in various applications of geometric algebras in computer
science, engineering, and physics.

We introduce a family of dualities between certain non-supersymmetric
self-dual gauge theories on a large class of $4d$ self-dual asymptotically flat
backgrounds, and the large $N$ limit of an independently defined $2d$ chiral
defect CFT. Our construction goes via twisted holography for the type I
topological string on a Calabi-Yau five-fold which fibres over twistor space.
In particular, we show that single-trace operators of the $2d$ defect CFT are
in bijection with states of the celestial chiral algebra. We match the operator
products of these states with the collinear splitting amplitudes of the
self-dual gauge theory up to one-loop. Assigning vacuum expectations to central
operators in the boundary theory computes bulk amplitudes on self-dual
backgrounds. We are able to extract form factors from these amplitudes, which
we use to give a simple closed formula for certain $n$-point two-loop all $+$
amplitudes in $\mathrm{SU}(K) \times \mathrm{SU}(R)$ gauge theory coupled to
bifundamental massless fermions.

It is well known that there is a duality map between the superstable
configurations and the critical configurations of a graph. This was extended to
all M-matrices in (Guzm\`an-Klivans 2015). We show a natural way to extend this
to all $(L,M)$-chip firing pairs introduced in (Guzm\`an-Klivans 2016). In
addition, we study various properties of this map.

Extracting work from a physical system is one of the cornerstones of quantum
thermodynamics. The extractable work, as quantified by ergotropy, necessitates
a complete description of the quantum system. This is significantly more
challenging when the state of the underlying system is unknown, as quantum
tomography is extremely inefficient. In this article, we analyze the number of
samples of the unknown state required to extract work. With only a single copy
of an unknown state, we prove that extracting any work is nearly impossible. In
contrast, when multiple copies are available, we quantify the sample complexity
required to estimate extractable work, establishing a scaling relationship that
balances the desired accuracy with success probability. Our work develops a
sample-efficient protocol to assess the utility of unknown states as quantum
batteries and opens avenues for estimating thermodynamic quantities using
near-term quantum computers.

The last decade has seen a number of advances in computationally efficient
algorithms for statistical methods subject to robustness constraints. An
estimator may be robust in a number of different ways: to contamination of the
dataset, to heavy-tailed data, or in the sense that it preserves privacy of the
dataset. We survey recent results in these areas with a focus on the problem of
mean estimation, drawing technical and conceptual connections between the
various forms of robustness, showing that the same underlying algorithmic ideas
lead to computationally efficient estimators in all these settings.

Let $E_2$ be the Morava E-theory of height 2 at the prime 2. In this paper,
we compute the homotopy groups of $E_2^{hC_6} \wedge \mathbb{R}P_2$ and
$E_2^{hC_6} \wedge \mathbb{R}P_2 \wedge \mathbb{C}P_2$ using the homotopy fixed
point spectral sequences.

Azadkia and Chatterjee (Azadkia and Chatterjee, 2021) recently introduced a
graph-based correlation coefficient that has garnered significant attention.
The method relies on a nearest neighbor graph (NNG) constructed from the data.
While appealing in many respects, NNGs typically lack the desirable property of
scale invariance; that is, changing the scales of certain covariates can alter
the structure of the graph. This paper addresses this limitation by employing a
rank-based NNG proposed by Rosenbaum (2005) and gives necessary theoretical
guarantees for the corresponding rank-based Azadkia-Chatterjee correlation
coefficient.

We establish the scaling limit of the geodesics to the root for the first
passage percolation distance on random planar maps. We first describe the
scaling limit of the number of faces along the geodesics. This result enables
to compare the metric balls for the first passage percolation and the dual
graph distance. It also enables to upperbound the diameter of large random
maps. Then, we describe the scaling limit of the tree of first passage
percolation geodesics to the root via a stochastic coalescing flow of pure jump
diffusions. This stochastic flow also enables us to construct some random
metric spaces which we conjecture to be the scaling limit of random planar maps
with high degrees. The main tool in this work is a time-reversal of the uniform
peeling exploration.

We study learning problems on correlated stochastic block models with two
balanced communities. Our main result gives the first efficient algorithm for
graph matching in this setting. In the most interesting regime where the
average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices, this algorithm
correctly matches all but a vanishing fraction of vertices with high
probability, whenever the edge correlation parameter $s$ satisfies $s^2 >
\alpha \approx 0.338$, where $\alpha$ is Otter's tree-counting constant.
Moreover, we extend this to an efficient algorithm for exact graph matching
whenever this is information-theoretically possible, positively resolving an
open problem of R\'acz and Sridhar (NeurIPS 2021). Our algorithm generalizes
the recent breakthrough work of Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu (STOC 2023), which is based
on centered subgraph counts of a large family of trees termed chandeliers. A
major technical challenge that we overcome is dealing with the additional
estimation errors that are necessarily present due to the fact that, in
relevant parameter regimes, the latent community partition cannot be exactly
recovered from a single graph. As an application of our results, we give an
efficient algorithm for exact community recovery using multiple correlated
graphs in parameter regimes where it is information-theoretically impossible to
do so using just a single graph.

We have studied irreducible real (respectively, quaternionic) Lie algebroid
connections and prove that the Gauge theoretic moduli space has Hausdorff
Hilbert manifold structure. This work generalises some known results about
simple semi-connections for complex vector bundle on compact complex manifold
in real algebraic geometry.

We consider a class of third-order evolution equations of the form
\begin{equation*} \left\{
  \begin{array}{l}
  \displaystyle
u_{t}=F\left(x,t,u,u_x,u_{xx},u_{xxx},v,v_x,v_{xx},v_{xxx}\right),
  \displaystyle
v_{t}=G\left(x,t,u,u_x,u_{xx},u_{xxx},v,v_x,v_{xx},v_{xxx}\right),
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation*} describing pseudos-pherical (\textbf{pss}) or
spherical surfaces (\textbf{ss}), meaning that, their generic solutions
$(u(x,t), v(x,t))$ provide metrics, with coordinates $(x,t)$, on open subsets
of the plane, with constant curvature $K=-1$ or $K=1$. These systems can be
described as the integrability conditions of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued linear
problems, with $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}(2,\R)$ or
$\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{su}(2)$, when $K=-1$, $K=1$, respectively. We obtain
characterization and also classification results. Applications of these results
provide new examples and new families of such systems, which also contain
systems of coupled KdV and mKdV-type equations and nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equations. Additionally, this theory is applied to derive a B\"acklund
transformation for the coupled KdV system.

In this paper we count the number of k-potent elements over HZp , the
quaternion algebra over Zp, and we give a descriptive formula for the general
case. For k in {3, 4, 5}, we give an explicit formula for these values.
Moreover, as an application, we count the number of solutions of the equation
xk = 1 over HZp .

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technology for
future mobile networks, enabling sensing applications to be performed by
existing communication networks, consequently improving the system efficiency.
Millimeter wave (mmWave) signals provide high sensing resolution and high data
rate but suffer from sensitivity to blockage. Cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO), with a large number of distributed access points (APs),
can overcome this challenge by providing macro diversity against changing
blockages and can save energy consumption by deactivating unfavorable APs.
Thus, in this work, we propose a joint dynamic AP mode selection and power
allocation scheme for mmWave cell-free massive MIMO-ISAC, where APs are
assigned either as ISAC transmitters, sensing receivers, or shut down. Due to
the large size of the original problem, we propose three different sub-optimal
algorithms that minimize the number of active APs while guaranteeing the
sensing and communication constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that
assigning ISAC transmitters only satisfying communication constraints, followed
up by sensing receiver assignment only for sensing constraint achieves the best
performance-complexity balance.

We study the global dynamics of solutions to a family of nonlinear
Schr\"odinger %(NLS) equations on the circle, with a smooth convolution
potential and Gevrey regular initial data. Our main result is the construction
of an asymptotically full measure set of time almost-periodic solutions, whose
hulls are invariant tori. Specifically, we show that for most choices of the
convolution potential there exists a bi-Lipschitz map from a ball in the space
of linear solutions to the space of initial data, such that all linear
solutions with frequencies satisfying a non-resonance condition are mapped to
initial data giving rise to an almost-periodic solution. As a consequence, we
establish that the Gevrey norm of many initial data remains approximately
constant in time and hence the elliptic fixed point at the origin is Lyapunov
statistically stable with respect to such a norm. Furthermore, we construct a
Cantor foliation of the phase space, where regions corresponding to positive
actions are foliated by invariant maximal tori. This result generalizes the
classical KAM theory in the infinite-dimensional setting, providing a
statistical description of the global dynamics near the fixed point. Our work
suggests that diffusive solutions should be looked for in spaces of lower
regularity, in line with recent findings in the theory of Hamiltonian PDEs

In the first part of this two-part paper, we construct a family MFD$_2$ of
low-correlation quaternary spreading codes having period $2046$. By quaternary,
we mean that the spreading code symbols are drawn from $Z_4$ and are designed
to be used in conjunction with QPSK modulation. Apart from low auto and
crosscorrelation properties, we also require in addition, to our knowledge for
the first time, that the spreading code family IZ4$_2$ obtained by taking the
union of the component in-phase and quadrature-phase binary spreading codes
associated to each quaternary spreading code in MFD$_2$, also have desirable
low-correlation properties. We also investigate the balance of the quaternary
and binary spreading codes.
  The second part is motivated by an application to the design of spreading
code, (in this application termed as ranging codes), having parameters suitable
for use in a lunar PNT system. Two lengths that are of particular current
interest for a planned lunar PNT satellite system are $2046$ and $10230$. We
study the applicability of a subset IZ4$_{2S}$ of IZ4$_2$ containing balanced
binary spreading codes having length $2046$ to such a lunar PNT system. We show
that the spreading codes belonging to IZ4$_{2S}$ compare favorably with the
spreading codes of length $2046$ appearing in a recent issue of Inside GNSS. We
also show that the IZ4$_{10}$ spreading code family in which the spreading
codes have length $10230$, compares well in comparison with spreading codes of
length $10230$ described in this article. In addition, the IZ4$_{10}$ and
IZ4$_2$ spreading codes have been paired so as to be orthogonal at zero shift
despite their different lengths and chipping rates.

Confidence sequences are sequences of confidence sets that adapt to incoming
data while maintaining validity. Recent advances have introduced an algorithmic
formulation for constructing some of the tightest confidence sequences for
bounded real random variables. These approaches use a coin-betting framework,
where a player sequentially bets on differences between potential mean values
and observed data. This letter establishes that such coin-betting formulation
is optimal among all possible algorithmic frameworks for constructing
confidence sequences that build on e-variables and sequential hypothesis
testing.

We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on the
Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that
$G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup
${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere
$SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up the
way for applications of such ans\"atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrme
theory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction is
based on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$
from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehat
K}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such a
mathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a way
that makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological
(homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct first
order partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutions
also solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic map
energy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturate
a lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitute
the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constitute
harmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of the
rational map ans\"atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

A relation between the Dirac bracket (DB) and Nambu bracket (NB) is
presented. The Nambu bracket can be related with Dirac bracket if we can write
the DB as a generalized Poisson structure. The NB associated with DB have all
the standard properties of the original DB. When the dimension of the phase
space is $s+2$ where $s$ is the number of second class constraints, the
associated Nambu structure has $s+2$ entries and reduces to the Dirac bracket
when $s$ of its entries are fixed to be the second class constraints. In
general, when the dimension of phase space is $d=r+s$ a new Nambu structure
that describes correctly the constrained dynamics can also be constructed but
in thsi case addicional conditidionts are requiered. In that case the
associated NB corresponds to a ``Dirac-Nambu'' bracket with $r$ entries.

Under mass-action kinetics, complex-balanced systems emerge from biochemical
reaction networks and exhibit stable and predictable dynamics. For a reaction
network $G$, the associated dynamical system is called $\textit{disguised
toric}$ if it can yield a complex-balanced realization on a possibly different
network $G_1$. This concept extends the robust properties of toric systems to
those that are not inherently toric. In this work, we study the
$\textit{disguised toric locus}$ of a reaction network - i.e., the set of
positive rate constants that make the corresponding mass-action system
disguised toric. Our primary focus is to compute the exact dimension of this
locus. We subsequently apply our results to Thomas-type and circadian clock
models.

The cactus group acts combinatorially on crystals via partial
Sch\"utzenberger involutions. This action has been studied extensively in type
$A$ and described via Bender-Knuth involutions. We prove an analogous result
for the family of crystals $B(n\varpi_1)$ in type $D$. Our main tools are
combinatorial toggles acting on reverse plane partitions of height $n$. As a
corollary, we show that the length one and two subdiagram elements generate the
full cactus action, addressing conjectures of Dranowski, the second author,
Kamnitzer, and Morton-Ferguson.

In this paper we propose efficient randomized fixed-precision techniques for
low tubal rank approximation of tensors. The proposed methods are faster and
more efficient than the existing fixed-precision algorithms for approximating
the truncated tensor SVD (T-SVD). Besides, there are a few works on randomized
single-pass algorithms for computing low tubal rank approximation of tensors,
none of them experimentally reports the robustness of such algorithms for
low-rank approximation of real-world data tensors e.g., images and videos. The
current single-pass algorithms for tensors are generalizations of those
developed for matrices to tensors. However, the single-pass randomized
algorithms for matrices have been recently improved and stabilized. Motivated
by this progress, in this paper, we also generalize them to the tensor case
based on the tubal product (T-product). We conduct extensive simulations to
study the robustness of them compared with the existing single-pass randomized
algorithms. In particular, we experimentally found that single-pass algorithms
with the sketching parameters of equal sizes usually lead to ill-conditioned
tensor least-squares problems and inaccurate results. It is experimentally
shown that our proposed single-pass algorithms are robust in this sense.
Numerical results demonstrate that under the same conditions (setting the same
hyper-parameters), our proposed algorithms provide better performance. Three
applications to image compression, super-resolution problem and deep learning
are also presented.

This paper proposes fast randomized algorithms for computing the Kronecker
Tensor Decomposition (KTD). The proposed algorithms can decompose a given
tensor into the KTD format much faster than the existing state-of-the-art
algorithms. Our principal idea is to use the randomization framework to reduce
computational complexity significantly. We provide extensive simulations to
verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed randomized algorithms
with several orders of magnitude acceleration compared to the deterministic
one. Our simulations use synthetics and real-world datasets with applications
to tensor completion, video/image compression, image denoising, and image
super-resolution

In this work we introduce a family of conformal flows generalizing the
classical Yamabe flow. We prove that for a large class of such flows long-time
existence holds, and the arguments are in fact simpler than in the classical
case. Moreover, we establish convergence for the case of negative scalar
curvature and expect a similar statement for the positive and the flat cases as
well.

Most algorithms for computing persistent homology do so by tracking cycles
that represent homology classes. There are many choices of such cycles, and
specific choices have found different uses in applications. Although it is
known that persistence diagrams can be computed in matrix multiplication time
[8] for the more general case of zigzag persistent homology, it is not clear
how to extract cycle representatives, especially if specific representatives
are desired. In this paper, we provide the same matrix multiplication bound for
computing representatives for the two choices common in applications in the
case of ordinary persistent (co)homology. We first provide a fast version of
the reduction algorithm, which is simpler than the algorithm in [8], but
returns a different set of representatives than the standard algorithm [6] We
then give a fast version of a different variant called the row algorithm [4],
which returns the same representatives as the standard algorithm.

Based on neural network and adaptive subspace approximation method, we
propose a new machine learning method for solving partial differential
equations. The neural network is adopted to build the basis of the finite
dimensional subspace. Then the discrete solution is obtained by using the
subspace approximation. Especially, based on the subspace approximation, a
posteriori error estimator can be derivated by the hypercircle technique. This
a posteriori error estimator can act as the loss function for adaptively
refining the parameters of neural network.

We construct facet-Hamiltonian cycles in the $B$-permutahedron, resolving a
conjecture raised in a recent paper by Akitaya, Cardinal, Felsner, Kleist and
Lauff [arxiv.org/abs/2411.02172].

Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) offers significant
advantages in mobility scenarios, mainly due to the elimination of cell
boundaries and strong macro diversity. In this paper, we examine the downlink
performance of cell-free mMIMO systems equipped with mobile-APs utilizing the
concept of unmanned aerial vehicles, where mobility and power control are
jointly considered to effectively enhance coverage and suppress interference.
However, the high computational complexity, poor collaboration, limited
scalability, and uneven reward distribution of conventional optimization
schemes lead to serious performance degradation and instability. These factors
complicate the provision of consistent and high-quality service across all user
equipments in downlink cell-free mMIMO systems. Consequently, we propose a
novel scalable framework enhanced by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
to tackle these challenges. The established framework incorporates a graph
neural network (GNN)-aided communication mechanism to facilitate effective
collaboration among agents, a permutation architecture to improve scalability,
and a directional decoupling architecture to accurately distinguish
contributions. In the numerical results, we present comparisons of different
optimization schemes and network architectures, which reveal that the proposed
scheme can effectively enhance system performance compared to conventional
schemes due to the adoption of advanced technologies. In particular,
appropriately compressing the observation space of agents is beneficial for
achieving a better balance between performance and convergence.

This work builds on our previous developments regarding a notion of freeness
for tensors. We aim to establish a tensorial free convolution for compactly
supported measures. First, we define higher-order analogues of the semicircular
(or Wigner) law and the free Poisson (or Marcenko-Pastur) law, giving their
moments and free cumulants. We prove the convergence of a Wishart-type tensor
to the free Poisson law and recall the convergence of a Wigner tensor to the
semicircular law. We also present a free Central Limit Theorem in this context.
Next, we introduce a tensorial free convolution, define the $R$-transform, and
provide the first examples of free convolution of measures.

We consider a variational model for heterogeneous phase separation, based on
a diffuse interface energy with moving wells. Our main result identifies the
asymptotic behavior of the first variation of the phase field energies as the
width of the diffuse interface vanishes. This convergence result allows us to
deduce a Gibbs-Thomson relation for heterogeneous surface tensions. Proceeding
from this information, we prove that (weak) solutions of the Allen-Cahn
equation with space dependent potential converge to a BV solution of weighted
mean curvature flow, under an energy convergence hypothesis. Additionally,
relying on the relative energy technique, we establish a weak-strong uniqueness
principle for solutions of weighted mean curvature flow.

We show that if $X$ is a smooth Fano manifold which caries a K\"ahler Ricci
soliton, then the canonical cone of the product of $X$ with a complex
projective space of sufficiently large dimension is a Calabi--Yau cone. This
can be seen as an asymptotic version of a conjecture by Mabuchi and Nikagawa.
This result is obtained by the openness of the set of weight functions $v$ over
the momentum polytope of a given smooth Fano manifold, for which a $v$-soliton
exists. We discuss other ramifications of this approach, including a
Licherowicz type obstruction to the existence of a K\"ahler Ricci soliton and a
Fujita type volume bound for the existence of a $v$-soliton.

Many time-dependent problems in the field of computational fluid dynamics can
be solved in a four-dimensional space-time setting. However, such problems are
computationally expensive to solve using modern high-order numerical methods.
In order to address this issue, efficient, node-centered edge-based schemes are
currently being developed. In these schemes, a median-dual tessellation of the
space-time domain is constructed based on an initial triangulation.
Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to construct median-dual regions or
deduce their properties on triangulations for $d \geq 4$. In this work, we
provide the first rigorous definition of median-dual regions on triangulations
in any number of dimensions. In addition, we present the first methods for
calculating the geometric properties of these dual regions. We introduce a new
method for computing the hypervolume of a median-dual region in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
Furthermore, we provide a new approach for computing the directed-hyperarea
vectors for facets of a median-dual region in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. These geometric
properties are key for facilitating the construction of node-centered
edge-based schemes in higher dimensions.

It is well-known that the classical Schwarz lemma yields an explicit
comparison of two Hermitian metrics with uniform constant negative curvature
bounds through holomorphic maps between complex manifolds. In this paper, we
establish Schwarz lemmas for holomorphic bundle maps between abstract Hermitian
holomorphic vector bundles with various positive curvature bounds. As
applications, we prove Schwarz lemmas for holomorphic maps between complex
manifolds whose curvature tensors are described by the notion
``RC-positivity''. In particular, new diameter and volume comparison theorems
are obtained by using Schwarz lemmas.

There are very few mathematical results governing the interpolation of
functions or their gradients on Delaunay meshes in more than two dimensions.
Unfortunately, the standard techniques for proving optimal interpolation
properties are often limited to triangular meshes. Furthermore, the results
which do exist, are tailored towards interpolation with piecewise linear
polynomials. In fact, we are unaware of any results which govern the
high-order, piecewise polynomial interpolation of functions or their gradients
on Delaunay meshes. In order to address this issue, we prove that
quasi-optimal, high-order, piecewise polynomial gradient interpolation can be
successfully achieved on protected Delaunay meshes. In addition, we generalize
our analysis beyond gradient interpolation, and prove quasi-optimal
interpolation properties for sufficiently-smooth vector fields. Throughout the
paper, we use the words 'quasi-optimal', because the quality of interpolation
depends (in part) on the minimum thickness of simplicies in the mesh.
Fortunately, the minimum thickness can be precisely controlled on protected
Delaunay meshes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, the current best mathematical
estimates for minimum thickness have been obtained on such meshes. In this
sense, the proposed interpolation is optimal, although, we acknowledge that
future work may reveal an alternative Delaunay meshing strategy with better
control over the minimum thickness. With this caveat in mind, we refer to our
interpolation on protected Delaunay meshes as quasi-optimal.

This paper attacks time-domain identification for the interaction parameters
of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems
being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear
time-invariant (QBTI) model. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate.
Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state
responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear
time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS
steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These
relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated TFMs can in principle be
estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from
input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right
tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these
relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters
of the NDS and the values of these TFMs.

Combining wireless communication with large artificial intelligence (AI)
models can open up a myriad of novel application scenarios. In sixth generation
(6G) networks, ubiquitous communication and computing resources allow large AI
models to serve democratic large AI models-related services to enable real-time
applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems. However, the security considerations and sustainable
communication resources limit the deployment of large AI models over
distributed wireless networks. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of
privacy, security, and trustworthy for distributed wireless large AI model
(WLAM). In particular, a detailed privacy and security are analysis for
distributed WLAM is fist revealed. The classifications and theoretical findings
about privacy and security in distributed WLAM are discussed. Then the
trustworthy and ethics for implementing distributed WLAM are described.
Finally, the comprehensive applications of distributed WLAM are presented in
the context of electromagnetic signal processing.

Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges in many machine learning
applications, particularly in the setting of distributed training and federated
learning, where malicious agents seek to corrupt the training process with the
goal of jeopardizing and compromising the performance and reliability of the
final models. In this paper, we address the problem of robust federated
learning in the presence of such attacks by formulating the training task as a
bi-level optimization problem. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the
resilience of consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), an interacting
multi-particle metaheuristic optimization method, in adversarial settings.
Specifically, we provide a global convergence analysis of CB$^2$O in mean-field
law in the presence of malicious agents, demonstrating the robustness of
CB$^2$O against a diverse range of attacks. Thereby, we offer insights into how
specific hyperparameter choices enable to mitigate adversarial effects. On the
practical side, we extend CB$^2$O to the clustered federated learning setting
by proposing FedCB$^2$O, a novel interacting multi-particle system, and design
a practical algorithm that addresses the demands of real-world applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the FedCB$^2$O algorithm
against label-flipping attacks in decentralized clustered federated learning
scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in practical contexts.

In this paper we strongly improve asymptotics for $s_1(n)$ (respectively
$s_2(n)$) which sums reciprocals (respectively squares of reciprocals) of parts
throughout all the partitions of $n$ into distinct parts. The methods required
are much more involved than in the case of usual partitions since the
generating functions are not modular and also do not posses product expansions.

The lifting degree and the deterministic construction of quasi-cyclic
low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes have been extensively studied, with
many construction methods in the literature, including those based on finite
geometry, array-based codes, computer search, and combinatorial techniques. In
this paper, we focus on the lifting degree $p$ required for achieving a girth
of 8 in $(3,L)$ fully connected QC-LDPC codes, and we propose an improvement
over the classical lower bound $p\geq 2L-1$, enhancing it to $p\geq
\sqrt{5L^2-11L+\frac{13}{2}}+\frac{1}{2}$. Moreover, we demonstrate that for
girth-8 QC-LDPC codes containing an arithmetic row in the exponent matrix, a
necessary condition for achieving a girth of 8 is $p\geq
\frac{1}{2}L^2+\frac{1}{2}L$. Additionally, we present a corresponding
deterministic construction of $(3,L)$ QC-LDPC codes with girth 8 for any $p\geq
\frac{1}{2}L^2+\frac{1}{2}L+\lfloor \frac{L-1}{2}\rfloor$, which approaches the
lower bound of $\frac{1}{2}L^2+\frac{1}{2}L$. Under the same conditions, this
construction achieves a smaller lifting degree compared to prior methods. To
the best of our knowledge, the proposed order of lifting degree matches the
smallest known, on the order of $\frac{1}{2}L^2+\mathcal{O} (L)$.

We study densities of $p$-adically bounded primes for hypergeometric series
in two cases: the case of generalized hypergeometric series with rational
parameters, and the case of $_2F_1$ with parameters in a quadratic extension of
the rational numbers. In the rational case we extend work from $_2F_1$ to
$_nF_{n-1}$ for an exact formula giving the density of bounded primes for the
series. The density is shown to be one exactly in accordance with the case of
finite monodromy as classified by Beukers-Heckmann. In the quadratic irrational
case, we obtain an unconditional lower bound on the density of bounded primes.
Assuming the normality of the $p$-adic digits of quadratic irrationalities,
this lower bound is shown to be an exact formula for the density of bounded
primes. In the quadratic irrational case, there is a trivial upper bound of
$1/2$ on the density of bounded primes. In the final section of the paper we
discuss some results and computations on series that attain this bound. In
particular, all such examples we have found are associated to imaginary
quadratic fields, though we do not prove this is always the case.

Let $C_\ell/\mathbb Q$ denote the curve with affine model
$y^\ell=x(x^\ell-1)$, where $\ell\geq 3$ is prime. In this paper we study the
limiting distributions of the normalized $L$-polynomials of the curves by
computing their Sato-Tate groups and distributions. We also provide results for
the number of points on the curves over finite fields, including a formula in
terms of Jacobi sums when the field $\mathbb F_q$ satisfies $q\equiv 1
\pmod{\ell^2}$.

Space missions, particularly complex, large-scale exploration campaigns, can
often involve many discrete decisions or events in their concepts of
operations. Whilst a variety of methods exist for the optimisation of
continuous variables in mission design, the inherent presence of discrete
events in mission ConOps disrupts the possibility of using methods that are
dependent on having well-defined, continuous mathematical expressions to define
the systems. Typically, mission architects will circumvent this problem by
solving the system optimisation for every permutation of the categorical
decisions if practical, or use metaheuristic solvers if not. However, this can
be prohibitively expensive in terms of computation time. Alternatively,
categorical decisions in optimisation problems can be expressed using binary
variables. If implemented naively, commercially available MILP solvers are
still slow to solve such a problem. Problems of this class can be solved more
efficiently using column generation methods. Here, restricted problems are
created by removing significant numbers of variables. The restricted problem is
solved, and the unused variables are priced to test which, if any, could
improve the objective of the restricted problem if they were to be added.
Column generation methods are problem-specific, and so there is no guaranteed
solution to these categorical problems. As such, the following paper proposes
guidelines for defining restricted problems representing space exploration
mission concepts of operations. The column generation process is described and
then applied to two case studies: a ConOps for a crewed Mars mission, in which
the design, assembly, and staging of the trans-Martian spacecraft is modelled
using discrete decisions; and the payload delivery scheduling of translunar
logistics in the context of an extended Artemis surface exploration campaign.

In the cops and robber game, there are multiple cops and a single robber
taking turns moving along the edges of a graph. The goal of the cops is to
capture the robber (move to the same vertex as the robber) and the goal of the
robber is to avoid capture. The cop number of a given graph is the smallest
number of cops required to ensure the capture of the robber. The k-component
order connectivity of a graph G = (V, E) is the size of a smallest set U, such
that all the connected components of the induced graph on V \ U are of size at
most k. In this brief note, we provide a bound on the cop number of graphs in
terms of their 2-component order connectivity.

We complement the recent theory of general singular integrals $T$ invariant
under the Zygmund dilations $(x_1, x_2, x_3) \mapsto (s x_1, tx_2, st x_3)$ by
proving necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness and compactness
of commutators $[b,T]$ from $L^p \to L^q$. Previously, only the $p=q$ upper
bound in terms of a Zygmund type little $\operatorname{BMO}$ space was known
for general operators, and it appears that there has been some confusion about
the corresponding lower bound in recent literature. We give complete
characterizations whenever $p \le q$ for a general class of non-degenerate
Zygmund type singular integrals. Some of the results are somewhat surprising in
view of existing papers - for instance, compactness always forces $b$ to be
constant. Even in the simpler situation of bi-parameter singular integrals it
appears that this has not been observed previously.

Two subsets $A, B$ of the plane are betweenness isomorphic if there is a
bijection $f\colon A\to B$ such that, for every $x,y,z\in A$, the point $f(z)$
lies on the line segment connecting $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ if and only if $z$ lies
on the line segment connecting $x$ and $y$. In general, it is quite difficult
to tell whether two given subsets of the plane are betweenness isomorphic. We
concentrate on the case when the sets $A,B$ belong to the family $ \mathcal
A_c$ of unions of pairs of concentric circles in the plane. We prove that $A, B
\in \mathcal A_c$ are betweenness isomorphic if and only if they are similar.
In particular, there are continuum many betweenness isomorphism classes in $
\mathcal A_c$, and each of these classes consists exactly of all scaled
translations of an arbitrary representative of the class. Furthermore, we show
that every betweenness isomorphism between sets $A,B\in \mathcal A_c$ is
exactly the restriction of a scaled isometry of the plane.

This paper investigates Singer's conjecture by examining the cohit module
$\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P^{\otimes h}$ for specific degrees and values
of $h$. Utilizing hit problem techniques, we extend previous work by Mothebe et
al. and establish key dimensional results. Notably, for $h\geq 6$, we prove
that the cohit module's dimension in certain degrees matches the order of a
specific factor group. Our contributions include demonstrating that certain
non-zero elements do not belong to the image of the Singer algebraic transfer.

$D$-optimal designs originate in statistics literature as an approach for
optimal experimental designs. In numerical analysis points and weights
resulting from maximal determinants turned out to be useful for quadrature and
interpolation. Also recently, two of the present authors and coauthors
investigated a connection to the discretization problem for the uniform norm.
Here we use this approach of maximizing the determinant of a certain Gramian
matrix with respect to points and weights for the construction of tight frames
and exact Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequalities in $L_2$. We present a direct and
constructive approach resulting in a discrete measure with at most $N \leq
n^2+1$ atoms, which discretely and accurately subsamples the $L_2$-norm of
complex-valued functions contained in a given $n$-dimensional subspace. This
approach can as well be used for the reconstruction of functions from general
RKHS in $L_2$ where one only has access to the most important eigenfunctions.
We verifiably and deterministically construct points and weights for a weighted
least squares recovery procedure and pay in the rate of convergence compared to
earlier optimal, however probabilistic approaches. The general results apply to
the $d$-sphere or multivariate trigonometric polynomials on $\mathbb{T}^d$
spectrally supported on arbitrary finite index sets~$I \subset \mathbb{Z}^d$.
They can be discretized using at most $|I|^2-|I|+1$ points and weights.
Numerical experiments indicate the sharpness of this result. As a negative
result we prove that, in general, it is not possible to control the number of
points in a reconstructing lattice rule only in the cardinality $|I|$ without
additional condition on the structure of $I$. We support our findings with
numerical experiments.

For any integers $n\geq 2$ and $1\leq r\leq n-1$ satisfying $3r\geq 2n-1$, we
show that the expected volume fraction of a random degree $d$ complex
submanifold of $\C\mathbb{P}^n$ of codimension $r$ where the bisectional
holomorphic curvature (for the induced ambient metric) is negative tends to one
when $d$ goes to infinity. Here, the probability measure is the natural one
associated with the Fubini--Study metric. We provide similar estimates for the
holomorphic sectional curvature, the Ricci curvature, and the scalar curvature.
Our results hold more generally for random submanifolds within any complex
projective manifold.

We obtain lower bounds for the dimension of fixed loci of abelian $p$-groups
acting on smooth projective varieties. Those arise from modulo p Chern numbers,
and are shown to be optimal. The bounds are expressed in a natural way by
introducing an appropriate filtration on the modulo $p$ cobordism ring. They
are obtained using equivariant localization methods, via the concentration
theorem, and by a technique of "partition dividing".

In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual
neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization.
Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning,
achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here
show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be
achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals
are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial
Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of
information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and
synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the
integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward,
feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute
uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is
expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be
directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization,
offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information
processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong
performance using local learning, our work advances a principled
information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.

This work is motivated by an attempt to construct a two-dimensional analogue
of the Wiener--Hopf method. It is supposed that understanding the branching
structure of unknown functions will provide insight into the form in which
these functions can be sought. The unknown functions are represented as
two-dimensional integrals of analytic functions with parameters, making it
natural to study the branching of the integration surface using
Picard--Lefschetz theory. A convenient matrix-vector representation of the main
result of Picard--Lefschetz theory is introduced, and the following two
statements are formulated. First, under certain constraints, the integration
surface can be represented as a finite-dimensional vector with coefficients in
the group ring over the fundamental group of the space with removed
singularities. Second, a bypass in the parameter space around one of the
components of the Landau set is described by multiplication by a relatively
simple matrix (also composed of elements from the group ring). Successive loops
are described by the product of such matrices. As an illustration, it is shown
how the matrix formalism yields the Picard-Lefschetz formula and provides
nontrivial topological relationships in the parameter space.

In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New
Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find
roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with
$deg (P)>deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set
$\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real
analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements
A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an
initial point $z_0$, not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a
root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point -
but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial,
the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic
curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is
contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds
for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do
not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic
function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and
heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by
the authors. The dynamics of BNQN seems also to have some similarities (and
differences) to the classical Leau-Fatou's flowers.

In this article we are interested for the numerical computation of spectra of
non-self adjoint quadratic operators, in two and three spatial dimensions.
Indeed, in the multidimensional case very few results are known on the location
of the eignevalues. This leads to solve nonlinear eigenvalue problems. In
introduction we begin with a review of theoretical results and numerical
results obtained for the one dimensional case. Then we present the numerical
methods developed to compute the spectra (finite difference discretization) for
the two and three dimensional cases. The numerical results obtained are
presented and analyzed. One difficulty here is that we have to compute
eigenvalues of strongly non-self-adjoint operators which are unstable. This
work is in continuity of a previous work in one spatial dimension.

For $q \in (0, 1)$, the deformed exponential function $f(x) = \sum_{n \geq 1}
x^n q^{n(n-1)/2}/n!$ is known to have infinitely many simple and negative zeros
$\{x_k(q)\}_{k \geq 1}$. In this paper, we analyze the series expansions of
$-x_k(q)/k$ and $k/x_k(q)$ in powers of $q$. We prove that the coefficients of
these expansions are rational functions of the form $P_n(k)/Q_n(k)$ and
$\widehat{P}_n(k)/Q_n(k)$, where $Q_n(k) \in {\mathbb Z}[k]$ is explicitly
defined and the polynomials $P_n(k), \widehat{P}_n(k)\in {\mathbb Z}[k]$ can be
computed recursively. We provide explicit formulas for the leading coefficients
of $P_n(k)$ and $\widehat{P}_n(k)$ and compute the coefficients of these
polynomials for $n \leq 300$. Numerical verification shows that $P_n(k)$ and
$\widehat{P}_n(k)$ take non-negative values for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and
$n\le 300$, offering further evidence in support of conjectures by Alan Sokal.

A rational function on a real algebraic curve $C$ is called separating if it
takes real values only at real points. Such a function defines a covering
$\mathbb R C\to\mathbb{RP}^1$. Let $c_1,\dots,c_r$ be connected components of
$\mathbb R C$. M. Kummer and K. Shaw defined the separating semigroup of $C$ as
the set of all sequences $(d_1(f),\dots,d_r(f))$ where $f$ is a separating
function and $d_i(f)$ is the degree of the restriction of $f$ to $c_i$.
  In the present paper we describe the separating semigroups of all genus 4
curves. For the proofs we consider the canonical embedding of $C$ into a
quadric $X$ in $\mathbb P^3$ and apply Abel's theorem to 1-forms obtained as
Poincar\'e residues at $C$ of certain meromorphic 2-forms on $X$.

Quantum error correction is an essential ingredient in the development of
quantum technologies. Its subject is to investigate ways to embed quantum
Hilbert spaces into a physical system such that this subspace is robust against
small imperfections in the physical systems. This task is exceedingly complex:
for one, this is due to the vast diversity of possible physical systems with
different structure to use. For another, every physical setting also comes with
its own imperfections that need to be protected against. Bred by the complexity
of a technological ambition, research on quantum error correction has developed
into a large field of research that ranges from engineering of small systems
with a single photon to the creation of macroscopic topological phases of
matter and models of complex emergent physics. A quintessential tool in quantum
error correction is the stabilizer formalism, which tames quantum systems by
enforcing symmetries. A Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a stabilizer
code that creates a logical subspace within an infinite dimensional Hilbert
space by endowing it with translational symmetries. While in practice the
infinitude of the Hilbert space, as well as the infinitude of the translational
symmetry group are considered as obstacles for implementation, in theory these
are precisely the features that make the theory of GKP codes particularly rich,
well behaved and well-connected to fascinating topics in mathematics. The
purpose of this thesis is to explore these connections: to understand the
coding theoretic and practical properties of GKP codes, utilizing its rich
mathematical foundation, and to provide a foundation for future research. Along
this journey we discover -- through the looking glass of GKP codes -- how
quantum error correction fits into a fabulous mathematical world and formulate
a series of dreams about possible directions of research.

A Transformer-based Koopman autoencoder is proposed for linearizing Fisher's
reaction-diffusion equation. The primary focus of this study is on using deep
learning techniques to find complex spatiotemporal patterns in the
reaction-diffusion system. The emphasis is on not just solving the equation but
also transforming the system's dynamics into a more comprehensible, linear
form. Global coordinate transformations are achieved through the autoencoder,
which learns to capture the underlying dynamics by training on a dataset with
60,000 initial conditions. Extensive testing on multiple datasets was used to
assess the efficacy of the proposed model, demonstrating its ability to
accurately predict the system's evolution as well as to generalize. We provide
a thorough comparison study, comparing our suggested design to a few other
comparable methods using experiments on various PDEs, such as the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the Burger's equation. Results show improved
accuracy, highlighting the capabilities of the Transformer-based Koopman
autoencoder. The proposed architecture in is significantly ahead of other
architectures, in terms of solving different types of PDEs using a single
architecture. Our method relies entirely on the data, without requiring any
knowledge of the underlying equations. This makes it applicable to even the
datasets where the governing equations are not known.

In this article, we prove a variety of uniqueness results for ultrahyperbolic
equations with general space and time dependent lower order terms. We address
the problem of determining uniqueness of solutions from boundary data as well
as when the data is prescribed on an interior subset. Furthermore, we also
present the case when the domain may change with respect to any one time
component and obtain analogous results. Our main tool for this purpose is
Carleman estimate. We obtain different uniqueness results depending on the
location of the reference point for the Carleman estimate relative to the
domain.

Recently, the ParaOpt algorithm was proposed as an extension of the
time-parallel Parareal method to optimal control. ParaOpt uses quasi-Newton
steps that each require solving a system of matching conditions iteratively.
The state-of-the-art parallel preconditioner for linear problems leads to a set
of independent smaller systems that are currently hard to solve. We generalize
the preconditioner to the nonlinear case and propose a new, fast inversion
method for these smaller systems, avoiding disadvantages of the current options
with adjusted boundary conditions in the subproblems.

We study the connection between Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns and the data
of the minimal resolution of a complex curve singularity: using Popescu-Pampu's
notion of the lotus of a singularity, we describe a bijection between the dual
resolution graphs of Newton non-degenerate plane curve singularities and
Conway-Coxeter friezes. We use representation theoretic reduction methods to
interpret some of the entries of the frieze coming from the partial resolutions
of the corresponding curve singularity. Finally, we translate the notion of
mutation, coming from cluster combinatorics, to resolutions of plane complex
curves.

We analyse a Fokker-Planck like equation, driven by a scalar parameter in
order to reach an integral constraint. We exhibit criteria guaranteeing
existence-uniqueness of a solution. We also provide counter-examples. This
problem is motivated by an application to the immune control of tumor growth.

In my 1993 paper, "Pappus's Theorem and the Modular Group", I explained how
the iteration of Pappus's Theorem gives rise to a $2$-parameter family of
representations of the modular group into the group of projective
automorphisms. In this paper we realize these representations as isometry
groups of patterns of geodesics in the symmetric space $X=SL_3(\R)/SO(3)$. The
patterns have the same asymptotic structure as the geodesics in the Farey
triangulation, so our construction gives a $2$ parameter family of deformations
of the Farey triangulation inside $X$. We also describe a bending phenomenon
associated to these patterns.

In this paper, we establish an asymptotic formula for the twisted second
moment of $L$-functions associated with Hecke--Maass cusp forms for $\rm
SL(3,\mathbb{Z})$, and further deduce a weighted zero-density estimate for
these $L$-functions in the spectral aspect which may have important
applications in other problems.

In this work, we present a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent
method termed as iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD)
method to solve nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard
assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method
converges to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first
propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) based on the method suggested
by Hanke and Raus, and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR.
Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any
a-priori knowledge of the noise level. We show that the method terminates in
finitely many steps in case of noisy data and has regularizing features.
Further, we discuss the convergence rates of the method using well-known source
and other related conditions under HPCR as well as discrepancy principle. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes both the
regularization properties and convergence rates of a stochastic gradient method
using a heuristic type rule in the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces. Finally, we provide the numerical experiments to showcase the practical
efficacy of the proposed method.

For every complete toric variety, there exists a projective toric variety
which is isomorphic to it in codimension one. In this paper, we show that every
smooth non-projective complete toric threefold of Picard number at most five
becomes projective after a finite succession of flops or anti-flips.

In this paper, we study infinite-horizon linear-quadratic uncertain
differential games with an output feedback information structure. We assume
linear time-invariant nominal dynamics influenced by deterministic external
disturbances, and players' risk preferences are expressed by a soft-constrained
quadratic cost criterion over an infinite horizon. We demonstrate that the
conditions available in the literature for the existence of a soft-constrained
output feedback Nash equilibrium (SCONE) are too stringent to satisfy, even in
low-dimensional games. To address this issue, using ideas from suboptimal
control, we introduce the concept of a soft-constrained output feedback
guaranteed cost equilibrium (SCOGCE). At an SCOGCE, the players' worst-case
costs are upper-bounded by a specified cost profile while maintaining an
equilibrium property. We show that SCOGCE strategies form a larger class of
equilibrium strategies; that is, whenever an SCONE exists, it is also an
SCOGCE. We demonstrate that sufficient conditions for the existence of SCOGCE
are related to the solvability of a set of coupled bi-linear matrix
inequalities. Using semi-definite programming relaxations, we provide linear
matrix inequality-based iterative algorithms for the synthesis of SCOGCE
strategies. Finally, we illustrate the performance of SCOGCE controllers with
numerical examples.

We investigate the multiplicity of solutions for a Hamiltonian system
coupling two systems associated with mixed boundary conditions. Corresponding
to the first system, we impose periodic boundary conditions and assume the
twist assumption commonly used for the Poincar\'e--Birkhoff theorem, while for
the second one, we consider a two-point boundary conditions of Neumann type.

This work addresses the problem of decentralized optimization on a compact
submanifold within a communication network comprising \(n\) nodes. Each node is
associated with a smooth, non-convex local cost function, and the collective
objective is to minimize the sum of these local cost functions. We focus on an
online scenario where local data arrives continuously in a streaming fashion,
eliminating the necessity for complete data storage. To tackle this problem, we
introduce a novel algorithm, the Decentralized Projected Riemannian Stochastic
Recursive Momentum (DPRSRM) method. Our approach leverages hybrid local
stochastic gradient estimators and utilizes network communication to maintain a
consensus on the global gradient. Notably, DPRSRM attains an oracle complexity
of \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}})\), which surpasses the performance of
existing methods with complexities no better than
\(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})\). Each node in the network requires only
\(\mathcal{O}(1)\) gradient evaluations per iteration, avoiding the need for
large batch gradient calculations or restarting procedures. Finally, we
validate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm through numerical
experiments, including applications in principal component analysis and
low-rank matrix completion, demonstrating its advantages over state-of-the-art
approaches.

In analogy with the construction of representations of adelic groups as
restricted products of representations of local groups, we study restricted
tensor products of Hilbert C*-modules and of C*-correspondences. The
construction produces global C*-correspondences from compatible collections of
local C*-correspondences. When applied to the collection of C*-correspondences
capturing local parabolic induction, the construction produces a global
C*-correspondence that captures adelic parabolic induction.

Flexible-antenna systems have recently received significant research interest
due to their capability to reconfigure wireless channels intelligently. This
paper focuses on a new type of flexible-antenna technology, termed pinching
antennas, which can be realized by applying small dielectric particles on a
waveguide. Analytical results are first developed for the simple case with a
single pinching antenna and a single waveguide, where the unique feature of the
pinching-antenna system to create strong line-of-sight links and mitigate
large-scale path loss is demonstrated. An advantageous feature of
pinching-antenna systems is that multiple pinching antennas can be activated on
a single waveguide at no extra cost; however, they must be fed with the same
signal. This feature motivates the application of non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA), and analytical results are provided to demonstrate the superior
performance of NOMA-assisted pinching-antenna systems. Finally, the case with
multiple pinching antennas and multiple waveguides is studied, which resembles
a classical multiple-input single-input (MISO) interference channel. By
exploiting the capability of pinching antennas to reconfigure the wireless
channel, it is revealed that a performance upper bound on the interference
channel becomes achievable, where the achievability conditions are also
identified. Computer simulation results are presented to verify the developed
analytical results and demonstrate the superior performance of pinching-antenna
systems.

This is one of a series of papers which aims towards a classification of
imprimitive affine groups of rank $3$.
  In this paper, a complete classification is given of such groups of
characteristic $p$ such that the point stabilizer is not $p$-local, which shows
that such groups are very rare, namely, the two non-isomorphic groups of the
form $2^4{:}\mathrm{GL}_3(2)$ with a unique minimal normal subgroup are the
only examples.

The unirationality of the moduli space of mathematical instantons on the
projective 3-space is proved for charges less than or equal to 7.

Let $X$ be a quasi-Banach space of analytic functions in the unit disc and
let $q>0$. A finite positive Borel measure $\mu$ in the closed unit disc
$\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ is called a $q$-reverse Carleson measure for $X$ if and
only if there exists a constant $C>0$ such that $$\|f\|_{X}\leq C
\|f\|_{L^q(\overline{\mathbb D},d\mu)} $$ for all $f\in X\cap
C(\overline{\mathbb D})$. We fully characterize the $q$-reverse Carleson
measures with all $q>0$ for Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb D)$ with all $0<p\leq
\infty$, for the space $\mathrm{BMOA}(\mathbb D)$ and for the Bloch space. In
addition, we describe $q$-reverse Carleson measures for the holomorphic
Triebel--Lizorkin spaces $HF_0^{q,r}$ and the holomorphic Besov spaces
$HB_0^{q,r}$. Related results are obtained for the Hardy spaces and certain
holomorphic Triebel--Lizorkin spaces in the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^d$.

Given a bialgebra $H$ such that the associated trivial topological bialgebra
$H[[\hbar]]$ admits a quasitriangular structure
$\tilde{\mathcal{R}}=\mathcal{R}(1\otimes 1+\hbar\chi+\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2))$,
one gets a distinguished element $\chi \in H \otimes H$ which is an
infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrix, according to the definition given in [1].
In this paper we classify infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrices for some
families of well-known Hopf algebras, among which are the generalized
Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebras $H_{2n^2}$, the Radford Hopf algebras
$H_{(r,n,q)}$, and the Hopf algebras $E(n)$.

An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three
dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can
be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.
  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions
(and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries
is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations
proper of modular forms.
  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the
Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band
inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band
structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials
models.

The Tracy-Singh product of matrices permits to construct a new gate $c
\boxtimes c'$ from two $2$-qudit gates $c$ and $c'$. If $c$ and $c'$ are both
Yang-Baxter gates, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also a Yang-Baxter gate, and if at
least one of them is entangling, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also entangling. A
natural question arises about the realisation of these gates, $c \boxtimes c'$,
in terms of local and universal gates. In this paper, we consider this question
and describe this realisation.

In our previous works we proved a finiteness property of the radii of
convergence functions associated with a vector bundle with connection on
$p$-adic analytic curves. We showed that the radii are locally constant
functions outside a locally finite graph in the curve, called controlling
graph. In this paper we refine that finiteness results by giving a bound on the
size of the controlling graph in terms of the geometry of the curve and the
rank of the module. This is based on super-harmonicity properties of radii of
convergence and partial heights of the Newton polygon. Under suitable
assumptions, we relate the size of the controlling graph associated with the
total height of the convergence Newton polygon to the Euler characteristic in
the sense of de Rham cohomology.

This dissertation is about rearrangement groups: a class of groups of
homeomorphisms of fractal topological spaces. Introduced in 2019 by J. Belk and
B. Forrest, this class generalizes the famous trio of Thompson groups $F$, $T$
and $V$ and includes some of their relatives and generalizations. After an
introduction to this topic, this dissertation branches into different aspects
of rearrangement groups.
  We first focus on a class of rearrangement groups of tree-like fractals known
as Wa\.zewski dendrites. We find finite generating sets for them and their
commutator subgroups, we prove that the commutator subgroups are simple (with
one possible exception) and we show that these groups are countable dense
subgroups of the groups of all homeomorphisms of dendrites.
  We then provide a sufficient condition to solve the conjugacy problem in
rearrangement groups using strand diagram. This condition is not necessary, but
understanding how to extend it is related to open problems in computer science.
This method solves the conjugacy problem in essentially all known rearrangement
groups.
  Next we study a group property known as invariable generation. With a
dynamical approach we prove that transitive enough rearrangement groups are not
invariably generated, which applies to most rearrangement group that has been
considered so far.
  Then we study the gluing relation that defines the fractal topological spaces
on which rearrangement groups act. We show that it is rational, i.e., there
exists a finite-state automaton which reads a pair of elements if and only if
they are related.
  We then show that finite and finitely generated abelian groups are
rearrangement groups and that the stabilizers of finite sets of rational points
of rearrangement groups are themselves rearrangement groups. Lastly, we prove
that every rearrangement group embeds into Thompson's group $V$.

In this work, we consider convex optimization problems with smooth objective
function and nonsmooth functional constraints. We propose a new stochastic
gradient algorithm, called Stochastic Halfspace Approximation Method (SHAM), to
solve this problem, where at each iteration we first take a gradient step for
the objective function and then we perform a projection step onto one halfspace
approximation of a randomly chosen constraint. We propose various strategies to
create this stochastic halfspace approximation and we provide a unified
convergence analysis that yields new convergence rates for SHAM algorithm in
both optimality and feasibility criteria evaluated at some average point. In
particular, we derive convergence rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/\sqrt{k})$,
when the objective function is only convex, and $\mathcal{O} (1/k)$ when the
objective function is strongly convex. The efficiency of SHAM is illustrated
through detailed numerical simulations.

A real number is called simply normal to base $b$ if every digit $0,1,\ldots
,b-1$ should appear in its $b$-adic expansion with the same frequency $1/b$. A
real number is called normal to base $b$ if it is simply normal to every base
$b, b^2, \ldots$. In this article, we discover a relation between the normality
of algebraic numbers and a mean of the Riemann zeta function on vertical
arithmetic progressions. Consequently, we reveal that a positive algebraic
irrational number $\alpha$ is normal to base $b$ if and only if we have \[
\lim_{N\to \infty}\frac{1}{\log N} \sum_{1\leq |n|\leq N}
\zeta\left(-k+\frac{2\pi i n}{\log b} \right) \frac{e^{2\pi i n \log \alpha
/\log b}}{n^{k+1}} =0 \] for every integer $k\geq 0$.

Let $F$ be a real quadratic field in which a fixed prime $p$ is inert, and
$E_0$ be an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ splits; put $E=E_0 F$. Let
${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}$ be the special fiber over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of the
Shimura variety for $G(U(1,n-1)\times U(n-1,1))$ with hyperspecial level
structure at $p$ for some integer $n\geq 2$. Let ${{\rm
Sh}}_{1,n-1}(K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{1})$ be the special fiber over
$\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of a Shimura variety for $G(U(1,n-1)\times U(n-1,1))$ with
parahoric level structure at $p$ for some integer $n\geq 2$. We exhibit
elements in the higher Chow group of the supersingular locus of ${{\rm
Sh}}_{1,n-1}$ and study the stratification of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}.$ Moreover,
we study the geometry of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}(K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{1})$ and prove a
form of Ihara lemma. With Ihara lemma, we prove the the arithmetic level
raising map is surjective for $n=2.$

Let $A$ be a $\rho$-contraction and $f$ a rational function mapping the
closed unit disk into itself. With a new characterization of
$\rho$-contractions we prove that \begin{align*} \big\|f(A)\big\|\leq
\frac{\rho}{2}\big(1-|f(0)|^{2}\big)+\sqrt{\frac{\rho^{2}}{4}\big(1-|f(0)|^{2}\big){}^{2}+|f(0)|^{2}}.
\end{align*} We further show that this bound is sharp. This refines an estimate
by Okubo--Ando and, for $\rho=2$, is consistent with a result by Drury.

It is known that there exist complex solvmanifolds $(\Gamma\backslash G,J)$
whose canonical bundle is trivialized by a holomorphic section which is not
invariant under the action of $G$. The main goal of this article is to classify
the six-dimensional Lie algebras corresponding to such complex solvmanifolds,
thus extending the previous work of Fino, Otal and Ugarte for the invariant
case. To achieve this, we complete the classification of six-dimensional
solvable strongly unimodular Lie algebras admitting complex structures and
identify among them, the ones admitting complex structures with Chern-Ricci
flat metrics. Finally we construct complex solvmanifolds with non-invariant
holomorphic sections of their canonical bundle. In particular, we present an
example of one such solvmanifold that is not biholomorphic to a complex
solvmanifold with an invariant section of its canonical bundle. Additionally,
we discover a new $6$-dimensional solvable strongly unimodular Lie algebra
equipped with a complex structure that has a non-zero holomorphic $(3,0)$-form.

We prove that every real nonnegative ternary quartic whose complex zero set
is smooth can be represented as the determinant of a symmetric matrix with
quadratic entries which is everywhere positive semidefinite. We show that the
corresponding statement fails for the Robinson polynomial, answering a question
by Buckley and \v{S}ivic.

In this paper, we investigate $V$-harmonic heat flows from complete
Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature to complete
Riemannian manifolds with sectional curvature bounded above. We give a gradient
estimate of ancient solutions to this flow and establish a Liouville type
theorem.

In this paper, we address a data dependent modification of the moving least
squares (MLS) problem. We propose a novel approach by replacing the traditional
weight functions with new functions that assign smaller weights to nodes that
are close to discontinuities, while still assigning smaller weights to nodes
that are far from the point of approximation. Through this adjustment, we are
able to mitigate the undesirable Gibbs phenomenon that appears close to the
discontinuities in the classical MLS approach, and reduce the smearing of
discontinuities in the final approximation of the original data. The core of
our method involves accurately identifying those nodes affected by the presence
of discontinuities using smoothness indicators, a concept derived from the
data-dependent WENO method. Our formulation results in a data-dependent
weighted least squares problem where the weights depend on two factors: the
distances between nodes and the point of approximation, and the smoothness of
the data in a region of predetermined radius around the nodes. We explore the
design of the new data-dependent approximant, analyze its properties including
polynomial reproduction, accuracy, and smoothness, and study its impact on
diffusion and the Gibbs phenomenon. Numerical experiments are conducted to
validate the theoretical findings, and we conclude with some insights and
potential directions for future research.

Our main result in this article is a proof (under mild technical assumptions)
of an analogue for $p$-adic Galois representations attached to a newform $f$ of
even weight $k\geq4$ of Kolyvagin's conjecture on the $p$-indivisibility of
derived Heegner points on elliptic curves, where $p$ is a prime number that is
ordinary for $f$. Our strategy, which is inspired by work of W. Zhang in weight
$2$, is based on a variant for modular forms of the congruence method
originally introduced by Bertolini-Darmon to prove one divisibility in the
anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for rational elliptic curves. We adapt
to higher (even) weight modular forms this approach via congruences, building
crucially on results of Wang on the indivisibility of Heegner cycles over
Shimura curves. Then we offer an application of our results on Kolyvagin's
conjecture to the Tamagawa number conjecture for the motive of $f$ and describe
other (standard) consequences on structure theorems for Bloch-Kato-Selmer
groups, $p$-parity results and converse theorems for $f$. Since in the present
paper we need $p>k+1$, our main theorem and its applications can be viewed as
complementary to results obtained by the first and third authors in their
article on the Tamagawa number conjecture for modular motives, where
Kolyvagin's conjecture was proved (in a completely different way exploiting the
arithmetic of Hida families) under the assumption that $k$ is congruent to $2$
modulo $2(p-1)$, which forces $p<k$. In forthcoming work, we will use results
contained in this paper to prove (under analogous assumptions) the counterpart
for an even weight newform $f$ of Perrin-Riou's Heegner point main conjecture
for elliptic curves ("Heegner cycle main conjecture" for $f$).

We discuss for the first time canonical differential equations for
hyperelliptic Feynman integrals. We study hyperelliptic Lauricella functions
that include in particular the maximal cut of the two-loop non-planar double
box, which is known to involve a hyperlliptic curve of genus two. We consider
specifically three- and four-parameter Lauricella functions, each associated to
a hyperelliptic curve of genus two, and construct their canonical differential
equations. Whilst core steps of this construction rely on existing methods
$\unicode{x2014}$ that we show to be applicable in the higher-genus case
$\unicode{x2014}$ we use new ideas on the structure of the twisted cohomology
intersection matrix associated to the integral family in canonical form to
obtain a better understanding of the appearing new functions. We further
observe the appearance of Siegel modular forms in the $\varepsilon$-factorized
differential equation matrix, nicely generalizing similar observations from the
elliptic case.

We construct {\it Topological Elliptic Genera}, homotopy-theoretic
refinements of the elliptic genera for $SU$-manifolds and variants including
the Witten-Landweber-Ochanine genus. The codomains are genuinely
$G$-equivariant Topological Modular Forms developed by Gepner-Meier, twisted by
$G$-representations. As the first installment of a series of articles on
Topological Elliptic Genera, this issue lays the mathematical foundation and
discusses immediate applications. Most notably, we deduce an interesting
divisibility result for the Euler numbers of $Sp$-manifolds.

We prove Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation with
scaling-critical electromagnetic potentials in dimensions $n\geq3$. The decay
assumption on the magnetic potentials is critical, including the case of the
Coulomb potential. Our approach introduces novel techniques, notably the
construction of Schwartz kernels for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator,
which separates the antipodal points of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, in these scaling
critical electromagnetic fields. This method enables us to prove the
$L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)\to L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the localized Schr\"odinger
propagator, as well as global Strichartz estimates. Our results provide a
positive answer to the open problem posed in arXiv:0901.4024 arXiv:1611.04805

Relations between average shortest path length and average clustering
coefficient, radiality, closeness and stress centralities were obtained for
simple graphs.

We study a transmission problem, in population dynamics, between two
juxtaposed habitats. In each habitat, we consider a generalized diffusion
equation composed by the Laplace operator and a biharmonic term. We consider
that the coefficients in front of each term could be negative or null. Using
semigroups theory and functional calculus, we give some relation between
coefficients to obtain the existence and the uniqueness of the classical
solution in $L^p$-spaces.

Shepard method is a fast algorithm that has been classically used to
interpolate scattered data in several dimensions. This is an important and
well-known technique in numerical analysis founded in the main idea that data
that is far away from the approximation point should contribute less to the
resulting approximation. Approximating piecewise smooth functions in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ near discontinuities along a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$
is challenging for the Shepard method or any other linear technique for sparse
data due to the inherent difficulty in accurately capturing sharp transitions
and avoiding oscillations. This letter is devoted to constructing a non-linear
Shepard method using the basic ideas that arise from the weighted essentially
non-oscillatory interpolation method (WENO). The proposed method aims to
enhance the accuracy and stability of the traditional Shepard method by
incorporating WENO's adaptive and nonlinear weighting mechanism. To address
this challenge, we will nonlinearly modify the weight function in a general
Shepard method, considering any weight function, rather than relying solely on
the inverse of the distance squared. This approach effectively reduces
oscillations near discontinuities and improves the overall interpolation
quality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the new
method in handling complex datasets, making it a valuable tool for various
applications in scientific computing and data analysis.

Clustered cell-free networking, which dynamically partitions the whole
network into nonoverlapping subnetworks, has been recently proposed to mitigate
the cell-edge problem in cellular networks. However, prior works only focused
on optimizing clustered cell-free networking in static scenarios with fixed
users. This could lead to a large number of handovers in the practical dynamic
environment with moving users, seriously hindering the implementation of
clustered cell-free networking in practice. This paper considers user mobility
and aims to simultaneously maximize the sum rate and minimize the number of
handovers. By transforming the multi-objective optimization problem into a
time-varying graph partitioning problem and exploring evolutionary spectral
clustering, a temporal-smoothed clustered cell-free networking algorithm is
proposed, which is shown to be effective in smoothing network partitions over
time and reducing handovers while maintaining similar sum rate.

We prove a connection formula for the basic hypergeomtric function
${}_n\varphi_{n-1}\left(
  a_1,...,a_{n-1},0;
  b_1,...,b_{n-1}
  ; q, z\right)$ by using the $q$-Borel resummation. As an application, we
compute $q$-Stokes matrices of a special confluent hypergeometric
$q$-difference system with an irregular singularity. We show that by letting
$q\rightarrow 1$, the $q$-Stokes matrices recover the known expressions of the
Stokes matrices of the corresponding confluent hypergeometric differential
system.

Tsukamoto (2022) introduced the notion of Bedford-McMullen carpet system, a
subsystem of $([0,1]^{\mathbb{N}}\times[0,1]^{\mathbb{N}},shift)$ whose metric
mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension does not coincide in general. The
aim of this paper is to develop the mean dimension theory for Bedford-McMullen
sponge system, which is a subsystem of $(([0,1]^r)^{\mathbb{N}},shift)$ with
arbitrary $3\leq r\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we compute the metric mean
dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension of such topological dynamical systems
explicitly, extending the results by Tsukamoto. The metric mean dimension is a
weighted combination of the standard topological entropy, whereas the mean
Hausdorff dimension is expressed in terms of weighted topological entropy. We
also exhibit a special situation for which the metric mean dimension and the
mean Hausdorff dimension of a sponge system coincide.

Traditional global positioning systems often underperform indoors, whereas
Wi-Fi has become an effective medium for various radio sensing services.
Specifically, utilizing channel state information (CSI) from Wi-Fi networks
provides a non-contact method for precise indoor positioning; yet, accurately
interpreting the complex CSI matrix to develop a reliable strategy for physical
similarity measurement remains challenging. This paper presents BiCSI, which
merges binary encoding with fingerprint-based techniques to improve position
matching for detecting semi-stationary targets. Inspired by gene sequencing
processes, BiCSI initially converts CSI matrices into binary sequences and
employs Hamming distances to evaluate signal similarity. The results show that
BiCSI achieves an average accuracy above 98% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of
less than three centimeters, outperforming algorithms directly dependent on
physical measurements by at least two-fold. Moreover, the proposed method for
extracting feature vectors from CSI matrices as fingerprints significantly
reduces data storage requirements to the kilobyte range, far below the
megabytes typically required by conventional machine learning models.
Additionally, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm adapts well
to multiple physical similarity metrics, and remains robust over different time
periods, enhancing its utility and versatility in various scenarios.

Let $p(n)$ denote the partition function. In this paper our main goal is to
derive an asymptotic expansion up to order $N$ (for any fixed positive integer
$N$) along with estimates for error bounds for the shifted quotient of the
partition function, namely $p(n+k)/p(n)$ with $k\in \mathbb{N}$, which
generalizes a result of Gomez, Males, and Rolen. In order to do so, we derive
asymptotic expansions with error bounds for the shifted version $p(n+k)$ and
the multiplicative inverse $1/p(n)$, which is of independent interest.

Let $X$ be a K3 surface, let $C$ be a smooth curve of genus $g$ on $X$, and
let $A$ be a base point free and primitive line bundle $g_d^r$ on $C$ with
$d\geq4$ and $r\geq\sqrt{\frac{d}{2}}$. In this paper, we prove that if
$g>2d-3+(r-1)^2$, then there exists a line bundle $N$ on $X$ which is adapted
to $|C|$ such that $|A|$ is contained in the linear system
$|N\otimes\mathcal{O}_C|$, and ${\rm{Cliff}}(N\otimes\mathcal{O}_C)\leq
{\rm{Cliff}}(A)$.

Information generating functions have been used for generating various
entropy and divergence measures. In the present work, we introduce quantile
based relative information generating function and study its properties. The
proposed generating function provides well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence
measure. The quantile based relative information generating function for
residual and past lifetimes are presented. A non parametric estimator for the
function is derived. A simulation study is conducted to assess performance of
the estimators. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a real life data.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely researched area in artificial
intelligence that focuses on teaching agents decision-making through
interactions with their environment. A key subset includes stochastic
multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which
model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the
foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic
theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds,
and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing
exploration-exploitation trade-offs. We also extend the discussion to $K$-armed
contextual bandits and SCAB, examining their methodologies, regret analyses,
and discussing the relation between the SCAB problems and the functional data
analysis. Finally, we highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges in the
field.

This paper studies stabilization of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems when
control actions can only be realized in finitely many directions where it is
possible to actuate uniformly or logarithmically extended positive scaling
factors in each direction. Furthermore, a nearest-action selection approach is
used to map the continuous measurements to a realizable action where we show
that the approach satisfies a weak sector condition for multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Using the notion of input-to-state stability,
under some assumptions imposed on the transfer function of the system, we show
that the closed-loop system converges to the target ball exponentially fast.
Moreover, when logarithmic extension for the scaling factors is realizable, the
closed-loop system is able to achieve asymptotic stability instead of only
practical stability. Finally, we present an example of the application that
confirms our analysis.

We develop a functional calculus on Archimedean vector lattices for
semicontinuous positively homogeneous real-valued functions defined on $\R^n$
which are bounded on the unit sphere. It is further shown that this
semicontinuous Archimedean vector lattice functional calculus extends the
existing continuous Archimedean vector lattice functional calculus by Buskes,
de Pagter, and van Rooij. We further utilize saddle representations of
continuous positively homogeneous functions to provide concrete formulas, for
functions abstractly defined via the continuous functional calculus, which are
completely in terms of vector lattice operations. Finally, we provide some
examples to illustrate the utility of the theory presented.

In this paper, we investigate various cardinal properties of the space
$Q_{C}X$ of all real-valued quasicontinuous functions on the topological space
$X$, under the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets. It begins by
examining the relationship between tightness and other properties in the
context of the space $X$, highlighting results such as the alignment of
tightness $Q_{C}X$ with the compact Lindel\"of number of $X$ under Hausdorff
conditions and the countable tightness of $Q_{C}X$ when $X$ is second
countable. Further investigations reveal conditions for the tightness of
$Q_{C}X$ relative to $k$-covers of $X$, as well as connections between density
tightness, fan tightness, and other properties in Hausdorff spaces.
Additionally, we discuss the implications of the Frechet-Urysohn property
$Q_{C}X$ for open $k$-covers in Hausdorff spaces. We explore relationships
between $Q_{C}X$'s tightness, the Frechet-Urysohn property, and the
$\sigma$-compactness of locally compact Hausdorff spaces $X$. Furthermore, we
examine the $k_{f}$-covering property and the existence of $k$-covers in the
context of Whyburn spaces.

The non-isomorphic locus of a general projection from an embedded smooth
projective variety to a hypersurface moves in a linear system of an effective
divisor which we call the double point divisor. David Mumford proved that the
double point divisor from outer projection is always base point free, and Bo
Ilic proved that it is ample except for a Roth variety. The first aim of this
paper is to show that the double point divisor from outer projection is very
ample except in the Roth case. This answers a question of Bo Ilic. Unlike the
case of outer projection, the double point divisor from inner projection may
not be base point free nor ample. However, Atsushi Noma proved that it is
semiample except when a variety is neither a Roth variety, a scroll over a
curve, nor the second Veronese surface. In this paper, we investigate when the
double point divisor from inner projection is base point free or big.

The secular manifold $\Sigma_G$ and its singularities are intimately related
to the spectra of metric graphs $(G,\ell)$. In this paper, we present a
complete description of the singular locus for tree graphs, and confirm that it
agrees with a conjecture of Colin de Verdi\`ere. We also discuss numerous
applications toward studying the behavior of metric tree graphs.

In this paper, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for countable fan
tightness and countable strong fan tightness of the space (briefly,
$C_{p}(X,G)$) of all group-valued continuous functions endowed with the
topology of pointwise convergence in term of Menger property and Rothberger
property respectively. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between
countable fan tightness, the Reznichenko property and the Hurewicz property for
the space $C_{p}(X,G)$. In addition to this we prove that the Menger property
is preserve during $G$-equivalence of topological spaces. Through this paper,
we establish a general result regarding fan tightness of $C_{p}(X,G)$ and
Hurewicz number of the space $X^{n}$ for every natural number $n$. Finally, we
study the monolithicity of the space $C_{p}(X,G)$.

In this paper, we focus on Oliver's $p$-group conjecture. We use elementary
method to prove that Oliver's $p$-group conjecture holds for Sylow
$p$-subgroups of unitary groups.

In this paper, we characterize arbitrary polynomial vector fields on $S^n$.
We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a degree one vector field
on the odd-dimensional sphere $S^{2n-1}$ to be Hamiltonian. Additionally, we
classify polynomial vector fields on $S^n$ up to degree two that possess an
invariant great $(n-1)$-sphere. We present a class of completely integrable
vector fields on $S^n$. We found a sharp bound for the number of invariant
meridian hyperplanes for a polynomial vector field on $S^2$. Furthermore, we
compute the sharp bound for the number of invariant parallel hyperplanes for
any polynomial vector field on $S^n$. Finally, we study homogeneous polynomial
vector fields on $S^n$, providing a characterization of their invariant
$(n-1)$-spheres.

Cardinal functions provide valuable insight into the topological properties
of spaces, helping to analyze and compare spaces in terms of their covering,
convergence and separation properties. This paper focuses on investigating
cardinal functions like network weight, Lindel\"of degree, tightness, weak
covering, pseudocharacter, and $i$-weight, for the spaces $Q_{P}(X)$ and
$Q_{P}(X,Y)$ of quasi-continuous functions under the topology of point-wise
convergence. In addition to these, we also investigate properties of
restriction and induced maps associated with the spaces $Q_{P}(X)$ and
$Q_{P}(X,Y)$.

Using some estimates in [J. Funct. Anal. {\bf 278}(2020), Article No.
108401], we completely characterized the boundedness and compactness of the
Stevi\'c-Sharma type operators with different weights and different composition
symbols between Bergman spaces induced by two-sides doubling weights.

Given a length function on the set of edges of a finite graph, the
corresponding Fujiwara Laplacian is defined. We consider a problem of
maximizing the first nonzero eigenvalue of this graph Laplacian over all
choices of edge-length function subject to a certain normalization. In this
paper we prove that the supremum of the first nonzero eigenvalue is infinite
whenever the graph contains a cycle.

We study the problem of finding an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point
(FOSP) of a smooth function, given access only to gradient information. The
best-known gradient query complexity for this task, assuming both the gradient
and Hessian of the objective function are Lipschitz continuous, is
${O}(\epsilon^{-7/4})$. In this work, we propose a method with a gradient
complexity of ${O}(d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-13/8})$, where $d$ is the problem
dimension, leading to an improved complexity when $d = {O}(\epsilon^{-1/2})$.
To achieve this result, we design an optimization algorithm that, underneath,
involves solving two online learning problems. Specifically, we first
reformulate the task of finding a stationary point for a nonconvex problem as
minimizing the regret in an online convex optimization problem, where the loss
is determined by the gradient of the objective function. Then, we introduce a
novel optimistic quasi-Newton method to solve this online learning problem,
with the Hessian approximation update itself framed as an online learning
problem in the space of matrices. Beyond improving the complexity bound for
achieving an $\epsilon$-FOSP using a gradient oracle, our result provides the
first guarantee suggesting that quasi-Newton methods can potentially outperform
gradient descent-type methods in nonconvex settings.

We investigate the random permutation matrices induced by the Chinese
restaurant processes with $(\alpha,\theta)$-seating. When $\alpha=0,\theta>0$,
the permutations are those following Ewens measures on symmetric groups, and
have been extensively studied in the literature. Here, we consider
$\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $\theta>-\alpha$. In an accompanying paper, a functional
central limit theorem is established for partial sum of weighted cycle counts
in the form of $\sum_{j=1}^n a_jC_{n,j}$, where $C_{n,j}$ is the number of
$j$-cycles of the permutation matrix of size $n$. Two applications are
presented. One is on linear statistics of the spectrum, and the other is on the
characteristic polynomials outside the unit circle.

A functional central limit theorem is established for weighted occupancy
processes of the Karlin model. The weighted occupancy processes take the form
of, with $D_{n,j}$ denoting the number of urns with $j$-balls after first $n$
samplings, $\sum_{j=1}^na_jD_{n,j}$ for a prescribed sequence of real numbers
$(a_j)_{j\in\mathbb N}$. The main applications are limit theorems for random
permutations induced by Chinese restaurant processes with
$(\alpha,\theta)$-seating with $\alpha\in(0,1), \theta>-\alpha$. An example is
briefly mentioned here, and full details are provided in an accompanying paper.

Nonlinear and nonaffine terms in parametric partial differential equations
can potentially lead to a computational cost of a reduced order model (ROM)
that is comparable to the cost of the original full order model (FOM). To
address this, the Reduced Residual Reduced Over-Collocation method (R2-ROC) is
developed as a hyper-reduction method within the framework of the reduced basis
method in the collocation setting. R2-ROC greedily selects two sets of reduced
collocation points based on the (generalized) empirical interpolation method
for both solution snapshots and residuals, thereby avoiding the computational
inefficiency. The vanilla R2-ROC method can face instability when applied to
parametric fluid dynamic problems. To address this, an adaptive enrichment
strategy has been proposed to stabilize the ROC method. However, this strategy
can involve in an excessive number of reduced collocation points, thereby
negatively impacting online efficiency.
  To ensure both efficiency and accuracy, we propose an adaptive time
partitioning and adaptive enrichment strategy-based ROC method (AAROC). The
adaptive time partitioning dynamically captures the low-rank structure,
necessitating fewer reduced collocation points being sampled in each time
segment. Numerical experiments on the parametric viscous Burgers' equation and
lid-driven cavity problems demonstrate the efficiency, enhanced stability, and
accuracy of the proposed AAROC method.

We generalize the classification of isomorphism classes of Schubert varieties
from complete flag varieties G/B to a class of partial flag varieties G/P. In
particular, we classify all Schubert varieties in G/P where P is a minimal
parabolic subgroup, and all Schubert surfaces which are two-dimensional
Schubert varieties.

The Boltzmann equation is one of the most famous equations and has vast
applications in modern science. In the current study, we take the randomness of
binary collisions into consideration and generalize the classical Boltzmann
equation into a stochastic framework. The corresponding Kolmogorov forward
equations and Liouville equation in either discrete or continuous time and
state space are derived respectively, whose characteristic line gives the
Boltzmann equation as a consequence of the law of large numbers. Then the large
deviations principle for these equations is established, which not only
explains the probabilistic origin of the H-theorem in the Boltzmann equation,
but also provides a natural way to incorporate the Boltzmann equation into a
broader Hamiltonian structure. The so-called Hamilton-Boltzmann equation enjoys
many significant merits, like time reversibility, the conservation laws of
mass, momentum and energy, Maxwellian-Boltzmann distribution as the equilibrium
solution, etc. We also present results under the diffusive limit in parallel.
Finally, the macroscopic hydrodynamic models including 13 moments are derived
with respect to our Hamilton-Boltzmann equation under the BGK approximation. We
expect our study can inspire new insights into the classical Boltzmann equation
from either the stochastic aspect or a Hamiltonian view.

Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes
multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian
evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. While serving as a prototypical sample-based
quantum algorithm, DME is a powerful tool for various quantum information
processing tasks, such as quantum principal component analysis and Hamiltonian
simulation. In this work, we present a detailed sample complexity analysis of
DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation. In particular, we prove that the
sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$, where $t$ is the
desired evolution time and $\varepsilon$ is the desired imprecision level, as
quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental
lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation,
which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative
factor, thereby proving that DME is optimal for sample-based Hamiltonian
simulation. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in
Appendix A of [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] appears to
be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here, given the
extensive use of DME over the past decade since its original proposal.

For the 2D cubic (mass-critical) Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation,
\begin{equation*} \partial_t\phi+\partial_{x_1}(\Delta \phi+\phi^3)=0,\quad
(t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^{2}, \end{equation*} we prove that there
exist no finite/infinite time blow-up solution with minimal mass in the energy
space. This nonexistence result is in contrast to the one obtained by
Martel-Merle-Rapha\"el [17] for the mass-critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries
(gKdV) equation. The proof relies on a refined ODE argument related to the
modulation theory and a modified energy-virial Lyapunov functional with a
monotonicity property.

We prove that any non-degenerate Bedford-McMullen carpet does not allow
oblique self-embedding similitudes; that is, if $f$ is a similitude sending the
carpet into itself, then the image of the $x$-axis under $f$ must be parallel
to one of the principal axes. We also establish a logarithmic commensurability
result on the contraction ratios of such embeddings. This completes a previous
study of Algom and Hochman [Ergod. Th. & Dynam. Sys. 39 (2019), 577--603] on
Bedford-McMullen carpets generated by multiplicatively independent exponents,
together with a new proof on their non-obliqueness statement.
  For the self-similar case, however, we construct a generalized Sierpinski
carpet that is symmetric with respect to an appropriate oblique line and hence
allows a reflectional oblique self-embedding. As a complement, we prove that if
a generalized Sierpinski carpet satisfies the strong separation condition and
permits an oblique rotational self-embedding similitude, then the tangent of
the rotation angle takes values $\pm 1$.

In this paper, we introduce Indigenous semirings and show that they are
examples of information algebras. We also attribute a graph to them and discuss
their diameters, girths, and clique numbers. Then, we proceed to investigate
their algebraic properties (including ideal theory). We also characterize units
and idempotent elements of formal power series over Indigenous semirings.

In this work, a recently introduced general framework for trajectory
statistical solutions is considered, and the question of convergence of
families of such solutions is addressed. Conditions for the convergence are
given which rely on natural assumptions related to a priori estimates for the
individual solutions of typical approximating problems. The first main result
is based on the assumption that the superior limit of suitable families of
compact subsets of carriers of the family of trajectory statistical solutions
be included in the set of solutions of the limit problem. The second main
result is a version of the former in the case in which the approximating family
is associated with a well-posed system. These two results are then applied to
the inviscid limit of incompressible Navier-Stokes system in two and three
spatial dimensions, showing, in particular, the existence of trajectory
statistical solutions to the two- and three-dimensional Euler equations, in the
context of weak and dissipative solutions, respectively. Another application of
the second main result is on the Galerkin approximations of statistical
solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.

We study the dynamics of the focusing nonlinear Hartree equation with a Kato
potential $$ i\partial_t u +\Delta u - Vu = -(|\cdot|^{-\gamma} \ast |u|^2)u,
\quad x \in \mathbb{R}^d $$ under some assumptions on the potential $V$. We
prove the blow up versus global existence dichotomy for solutions beyond the
threshold, based on the method from Duyckaerts-Roudenko [6].
  Furthermore, our result compensates for the one of in [13] below that
threshold.

We investigate the fundamental properties of Minkowski billiards and
introduce a new coordinate system $(s,u)$ on the phase space $\mathcal{M}$. In
this coordinate system, the Minkowski billiard map $\mathcal{T}$ preserves the
standard area form $\omega = ds \wedge du$. We then classify the periodic
orbits of Minkowski billiards with period $2$ and derive formulas for the twist
coefficient $\tau_1$ for elliptic periodic orbits, expressed in terms of the
geometric characteristics of the billiard table. Additionally, we analyze the
stability properties of these elliptic periodic orbits.

In this article, we study random graphs with a given degree sequence $d_1,
d_2, \cdots, d_n$ from the configuration model. We show that under mild
assumptions of the degree sequence, the spectral distribution of the normalized
Laplacian matrix of such random graph converges in distribution to the
semicircle distribution as the number of vertices $n\rightarrow \infty$. This
extends work by McKay (1981) and Tran, Vu and Wang (2013) which studied random
regular graphs ($d_1=d_2=\cdots=d_n=d$). Furthermore, we extend the assumption
to show that a slightly more general condition is equivalent to the weak
convergence to semicircle distribution. The equivalence is also illustrated by
numerical simulations.

We establish lower bounds for the $2k$-th moment of central values of the
family of primitive Dirichlet $L$-functions to a fixed prime modulus for all
real $k<0$, assuming the non-vanishing of these $L$-values.

We present an adaptive trust-region method for unconstrained optimization
that allows inexact solutions to the trust-region subproblems. Our method is a
simple variant of the classical trust-region method of Sorensen [1]. The method
achieves the best possible convergence bound up to an additive log factor, for
finding an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point, i.e., $O( \Delta_f L^{1/2}
\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \tilde{O}(1)$ iterations where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant
of the Hessian, $\Delta_f$ is the optimality gap, and $\epsilon$ is the
termination tolerance for the gradient norm. This improves over existing
trust-region methods whose worst-case bound is at least a factor of $L$ worse.
We compare our performance with state-of-the-art trust-region (TRU) and cubic
regularization (ARC) methods from the GALAHAD library on the CUTEst benchmark
set on problems with more than 100 variables. We use fewer function, gradient,
and Hessian evaluations than these methods. For instance, our algorithm's
median number of gradient evaluations is $23$ compared to $36$ for TRU and $29$
for ARC.
  Compared to the conference version of this paper [2], our revised method
includes practical enhancements and a refined subproblems termination
criterion. These modifications dramatically improved performance, including an
order of magnitude reduction in the shifted geometric mean of wall-clock times.

In the application of brain-computer interface (BCI), while pursuing accurate
decoding of brain signals, we also need consider the computational efficiency
of BCI devices. ECoG signals are multi-channel temporal signals which is
collected using a high-density electrode array at a high sampling frequency.
The data between channels has a high similarity or redundancy in the temporal
domain. The redundancy of data not only reduces the computational efficiency of
the model, but also overwhelms the extraction of effective features, resulting
in a decrease in performance. How to efficiently utilize ECoG multi-channel
signals is one of the research topics. Effective channel screening or
compression can greatly reduce the model size, thereby improving computational
efficiency, this would be a good direction to solve the problem. Based on
previous work [1], this paper proposes a very simple channel compression
method, which uses a learnable matrix to perform matrix multiplication on the
original channels, that is, assigning weights to the channels and then linearly
add them up. This effectively reduces the number of final channels. In the
experiment, we used the vision-based ECoG multi-classification dataset owned by
our laboratory to test the proposed channel selection (compression) method. We
found that the new method can compress the original 128-channel ECoG signal to
32 channels (of which subject MonJ is compressed to 8 channels), greatly
reducing the size of the model. The demand for GPU memory resources during
model training is reduced by about 68.57%, 84.33% for each subject
respectively; the model training speed also increased up around 3.82, 4.65
times of the original speed for each subject respectively. More importantly,
the performance of the model has improved by about 1.10% compared with our
previous work, reached the SOTA level of our unique visual based ECoG dataset

The fracturing-flooding technology is a new process for the development of
low-permeability oil reservoirs, achieving a series of successful applications
in oilfield production. However, existing numerical simulation methods for
pressure drive struggle to efficiently and accurately simulate the dynamic
changes in reservoir properties during the fracturing-flooding process,
particularly the expansion and closure of fractures within the reservoir. This
paper introduces a Darcy flow model with dual-porous and dual-permeable
characteristics based on seepage mechanics theory, utilizing two sets of rock
stress-sensitive parameter tables to describe the physical property changes of
the matrix and fractures during the fracturing-flooding process. Different
parameters are set for the X and Y directions to characterize the anisotropic
features of the reservoir. A numerical simulation method aimed at dynamic
analysis of fracturing-flooding is established, along with an automatic history
fitting method based on the CMA-ES algorithm to derive rock mechanics
parameters that align with actual block conditions.

Wave/Schr\"{o}dinger equations with potentials naturally originates from both
the quantum physics and the study of nonlinear equations. The distractive
Coulomb potential is a quantum mechanical description of distractive Coulomb
force between two particles with the same charge. The spectrum of the operator
$-\Delta +1/|x|$ is well known and there are also a few results on the
Strichartz estimates, local and global well-posedness and scattering result
about the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a distractive Coulomb
potential. In the contrast, much less is known for the global and asymptotic
behaviour of solutions to the corresponding wave equations with a Coulomb
potential.
  In this work we consider the wave equation with a distractive Coulomb
potential in dimensions $d\geq 3$. We first describe the asymptotic behaviour
of the solutions to the linear homogeneous Coulomb wave equation, especially
their energy distribution property and scattering profiles, then show that the
radial finite-energy solutions to suitable defocusing Coulomb wave equation are
defined for all time and scatter in both two time directions, by establishing a
family of radial Strichartz estimates and combining them with the decay of the
potential energy.

Let $N(\sigma,T)$ denote the number of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta
function with real part greater than $\sigma$ and imaginary part lying between
$0$ and $T$. In this article, we provide an explicit version of Carlson's zero
density estimate, that is, $N(\sigma, T) \leq 0.78 T^{4 \sigma (1- \sigma)}
(\log T)^{5-2 \sigma} $, with a slight improvement in the exponent of the
logarithm factor.

Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in
Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a
major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e,
whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing
problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^?0\}$. Until this work it was
open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove
that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^?0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the
vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on
constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations
for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's
Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We apply our
construction to show that the vanishing problem is in ${\sf NP}_{\mathbb{C}}
\cap {\sf P}_{\mathbb{R}}$ in the Blum--Shub--Smale (BSS) model of computation
over complex and real numbers respectively. Similarly, we prove that computing
Schubert coefficients is in $\#{\sf P}_{\mathbb{C}}$, a counting version of the
BSS model. We also extend our results to classical types. With one notable
exception of the vanishing problem in type $D$, all our results extend to all
types.

This paper focuses on semilattices with adjunctions (SLatas), which are
semilattices with a greatest element enriched with a pair of adjoint maps. We
develop a spectral-style duality for SLatas, building on prior topological
dualities for monotone semilattices. As an application of this duality, we
characterize SLata congruences through an adaptation of lower-Vietoris-type
families. Furthermore, we investigate tense operators on semilattices with a
greatest element, deriving a duality for this case by extending the results
obtained for SLatas.

This paper presents a novel auto-encoder based end-to-end channel encoding
and decoding. It integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and graph neural
networks (GNN) in code design by modeling the generation of code parity-check
matrices as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), to optimize key coding performance
metrics such as error-rates and code algebraic properties. An edge-weighted GNN
(EW-GNN) decoder is proposed, which operates on the Tanner graph with an
iterative message-passing structure. Once trained on a single linear block
code, the EW-GNN decoder can be directly used to decode other linear block
codes of different code lengths and code rates. An iterative joint training of
the DRL-based code designer and the EW-GNN decoder is performed to optimize the
end-end encoding and decoding process. Simulation results show the proposed
auto-encoder significantly surpasses several traditional coding schemes at
short block lengths, including low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with the
belief propagation (BP) decoding and the maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD), and
BCH with BP decoding, offering superior error-correction capabilities while
maintaining low decoding complexity.

Postnikov--Stanley polynomials $D_u^w$ are a generalization of skew dual
Schubert polynomials to the setting of arbitrary Weyl groups. We prove that
Postnikov--Stanley polynomials are Lorentzian by showing that they are degree
polynomials of Richardson varieties. Our result yields an interesting class of
Lorentzian polynomials related to the geometry of Richardson varieties,
generalizes the result that dual Schubert polynomials are Lorentzian
(Huh--Matherne--M\'esz\'aros--St. Dizier 2022), and resolves the conjecture
that Postnikov--Stanley polynomials are M-convex (An--Tung--Zhang 2024).

These notes cover and expand upon the material for two summer schools: The
first, which was held at CIRM, Marseille, France, July 10-14, 2023, as part of
"Renormalization and Visualization for packing, billiard and surfaces", was
titled "Number theory as a door to geometry, dynamics and illustration". The
second was held at NSU IMS in Singapore, June 3-7, 2024, as part of
"Computational Aspects of Thin Groups", and was titled "Integral packings and
number theory". Both courses were put together by a number theorist for
students and researchers in other fields. They cover a web of ideas relating to
Apollonian circle packings, integral orbits, thin groups, hyperbolic geometry,
continued fractions, and Diophantine approximation. The connection of geometry
and dynamics to number theory gives an opportunity to illustrate arithmetic by
appealing to our visual intuition.

Let $n,d$, and $k$ be positive integers where $n$ and $d$ are coprime. Our
two main results are
  Theorem 1. There is a partition of the infinite interval $[kd,\infty)$ of
positive integers into a family of finite sets $X$ for which the sum of the
reciprocals of the elements in $X$ is $n/d$.
  Theorem 1. There is a partition of $[2kd,\infty)$ into an infinite family of
infinite sets $Y$ for which the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $Y$
is $n/d$.
  Our method is grounded in the Vital Identity, $1/z = 1/(z+1) + 1/z(z+1)$,
which holds for every complex number $z \notin \{-1,0\}$, and which gives rise
to an eponymous algorithm that serves as our tool. At the core of our Theorems
1 and 2 is the number theoretic function $\star: x\mapsto \star x := x(x+1)$
into whose properties this paper continues an investigation initiated in [7].

The main purpose of this article is to establish new uniqueness results for
Calder\'on type inverse problems related to damped nonlocal wave equations. To
achieve this goal we extend the theory of very weak solutions to our setting,
which allows to deduce an optimal Runge approximation theorem. With this result
at our disposal, we can prove simultaneous determination results in the linear
and semilinear regime.

In this article, we study inertial algorithms for numerically solving
monotone inclusions involving the sum of a maximally monotone and a cocoercive
operator. In particular, we analyze the convergence of inertial and relaxed
versions of the nonlinear forward-backward with momentum (NFBM). We propose an
inertial version including a relaxation step, and a second version considering
a double-inertial step with additional momentum. By applying NFBM to specific
monotone inclusions, we derive inertial and relaxed versions of algorithms such
as forward-backward, forward-half-reflect-backward (FHRB), Chambolle-Pock,
Condat-V\~u, among others, thereby recovering and extending previous results
from the literature for solving monotone inclusions involving maximally
monotone, cocoercive, monotone and Lipschitz, and linear bounded operators. We
also present numerical experiments on image restoration, comparing the proposed
inertial and relaxation algorithms. In particular, we compare the inertial FHRB
with its non-inertial and momentum versions. Additionally, we compare the
numerical convergence for larger step-sizes versus relaxation parameters and
introduce a restart strategy that incorporates larger step-sizes and inertial
steps to further enhance numerical convergence.

We study the minimal $q$-exponent $\Delta$ in the BPS $q$-series
$\widehat{Z}$ of negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds equipped with a
spin$^c$-structure. We express $\Delta$ of Seifert manifolds in terms of an
invariant commonly used in singularity theory. We provide several examples
illustrating the interesting behaviour of $\Delta$ for non-Seifert manifolds.
Finally, we compare $\Delta$ invariants with correction terms in
Heegaard--Floer homology.

As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and
differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe
autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning
approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and
autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes
less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the
partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and
improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear
problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear
solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer
improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and
a 10-D quadrotor control problem.

In this paper we investigate a class of integrals that were encountered in
the course of a work on statistical plasma physics, in the so-called Sommerfeld
temperature-expansion of the electronic entropy. We show that such integrals,
involving some parameters, can be fully described in closed form represented by
special functions.

We prove the existence of a constant $C > 0$ such that for any generic
2-dimensional Riemannian sphere $(S^2, g)$, there exist two distinct closed
geodesics with lengths $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ satisfying $L_{1} L_{2} \leq C
\mathrm{Area}(S^2, g)$.

In this note, we give several characterizations of left pure-semisimple in
terms of the (pre)envelope, (pre)cover, direct limits, direct sums, inverse
limits and direct products properties of pure-projective modules or
pure-injective modules.

Graphs are fundamental tools for modeling pairwise interactions in complex
systems. However, many real-world systems involve multi-way interactions that
cannot be fully captured by standard graphs. Hypergraphs, which generalize
graphs by allowing edges to connect any number of vertices, offer a more
expressive framework. In this paper, we introduce a new metric on the space of
hypergraphs, inspired by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance for metric spaces. We
establish Lipschitz properties of common hypergraph transformations, which send
hypergraphs to graphs, including a novel graphification method with ties to
single linkage hierarchical clustering. Additionally, we derive lower bounds
for the hypergraph distance via invariants coming from basic summary statistics
and from topological data analysis techniques. Finally, we explore stability
properties of cost functions in the context of optimal transport. Our results
in this direction consider Lipschitzness of the Hausdorff map and conservation
of the non-negative cross curvature property under limits of cost functions.

The Ceresa cycle is a canonical algebraic $1$-cycle on the Jacobian of an
algebraic curve. We construct an algorithm which, given a curve over a number
field, often provides a certificate that the Ceresa cycle is non-torsion,
without relying on the presence of any additional symmetries of the curve.
Under the hypothesis that the Sato--Tate group is the whole of
$\operatorname*{GSp}$, we prove that if the Ceresa class (the image of the
Ceresa cycle in \'{e}tale cohomology) is non-torsion, then the algorithm will
eventually terminate with a certificate attesting to this fact.

Let $X$ be a weakly pseudoconvex manifold and $L\longrightarrow X$ be a
holomorphic line bundle with a singular positive Hermitian metric $h$. In this
article, we provide a points separation theorem and an embedding for the
adjoint linear subsystem including the multiplier ideal sheaf
$\mathscr{I}(h^m)$, with respect to an appropriate set excluding a singular
locus of $h$. We also show that the adjoint bundle of $L$ is big. To handle
analytical methods, we first establish an approximation of singular Hermitian
metrics on relatively compact subsets from Demailly's approximation that
preserves ideal sheaves and is compatible with blow-ups. Using the blow-ups
obtained from this approximation, we provide the embedding and big-ness for the
adjoint bundle $K_X\otimes L^{\otimes m}\otimes\mathscr{I}(h^m)$ on each
sublevel set $X_c$, and a singular holomorphic Morse inequality including ideal
sheaves. Furthermore, we establish the approximation theorem for holomorphic
sections of the adjoint bundle including the multiplier ideal sheaf, i.e.
$K_X\otimes L\otimes\mathscr{I}(h)$, as a key result in the process of
globalizing. Using these results, we can achieve points separation on each
$X_c\setminus Z_c$, where $Z_c$ is an analytic subset obtained as a singular
locus of the approximation, and then globalize this to provide embeddings.
Finally, as an application of this blow-ups, we present a global singular
Nakano vanishing theorem.

Link equivalence up to isotopy in a 3-space is the problem that lies at the
root of knot theory, and is important in 3-dimensional topology and geometry.
We consider its restriction to alternating links, given by two alternating
diagrams with $n_1$ and $n_2$ crossings, and show that this problem has
polynomial algorithm in terms of $max\{n_1, n_2\}$. For the proof, we use Tait
flyping conjectures, observations from the work of Lackenby, Menasco, Sundberg
and Thistlethwaite on alternating links, and algorithmic complexity of some
problems from graph theory and topological graph theory.

In this paper we prove new multiplicity results for a critical growth
anisotropic quasilinear elliptic system that is coupled through a subcritical
perturbation term. We identify a certain scaling for the system and a parameter
{\gamma} related to this scaling that determines the geometry of the associated
variational functional. This leads to a natural classification of different
nonlinear regimes for the system in terms of scaling properties of the
perturbation term. We give three different types of multiplicity results in the
three regimes {\gamma} = 1, {\gamma} > 1, and {\gamma} < 1. Proofs of our
multiplicity results are based on a new abstract critical point theorem for
symmetric functionals on product spaces, which we prove using the piercing
property of the Z2-cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz. This abstract
result only requires a local (PS) condition and is therefore applicable to
systems with critical growth. It is of independent interest as it has wide
applicability to many different types of critical elliptic systems. We also
indicate how it can be applied to obtain similar multiplicity results for
nonlocal systems.

We consider a competition between $d+1$ players, and aim to identify the
"most exciting game'' of this kind. This is translated, mathematically, into a
stochastic optimization problem over martingales that live on the
$d$-dimensional subprobability simplex $\Delta$ and terminate on the vertices
of $\Delta$ (so-called win-martingales), with a cost function related to a
scaling limit of Shannon entropies. We uncover a surprising connection between
this problem and the seemingly unrelated field of Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations:
If $g$ solves \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} g(x)=\log
\det\left(\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 g(x)\right), \quad \, \ \ \ \ \, \, \, \, x \in
\Delta, \\ g(x)=\infty, \quad \quad \quad \quad \ \ \ \ \ \quad \quad \, \ \ \
\ \ x\in \partial \Delta, \end{cases} \end{equation*} then the
winning-probability of the players in the most exciting game is described by
$$dM_s=\sqrt{\frac{2 (\nabla^2 g(M_s))^{-1}}{1-s} } \, dB_s.$$ To formalize
this, a detailed quantitative analysis of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for $g$
is crucial. This is then leveraged to prove that $M$ is indeed an optimal
win-martingale.

Langevin algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian
learning, particularly when the aim is to sample from the posterior
distribution of a parametric model, given the input data and the prior
distribution over the model parameters. Their stochastic versions such as
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) allow iterative learning based on
randomly sampled mini-batches of large datasets and are scalable to large
datasets. However, when data is decentralized across a network of agents
subject to communication and privacy constraints, standard SGLD algorithms
cannot be applied. Instead, we employ decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) algorithms,
where Bayesian learning is performed collaboratively by a network of agents
without sharing individual data. Nonetheless, existing DE-SGLD algorithms
induce a bias at every agent that can negatively impact performance; this bias
persists even when using full batches and is attributable to network effects.
Motivated by the EXTRA algorithm and its generalizations for decentralized
optimization, we propose the generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin
dynamics, which eliminates this bias in the full-batch setting. Moreover, we
show that, in the mini-batch setting, our algorithm provides performance bounds
that significantly improve upon those of standard DE-SGLD algorithms in the
literature. Our numerical results also demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed approach.

For a given integer $m$ and any residue $a \pmod{m}$ that can be written as a
sum of 3 squares modulo $m$, we show the existence of infinitely many integers
$n \equiv a \pmod{m}$ such that the number of representations of $n$ as a sum
of three squares, $r_3(n)$, satisfies $r_3(n) \gg_m \sqrt{n} \log \log n$.
Consequently, we establish that there are infinitely many integers $n \equiv a
\pmod{m}$ for which the Hurwitz class number $H(n)$ also satisfies $H(n) \gg_m
\sqrt{n} \log \log n$.

We use the square peg problem for smooth curves to prove a generalized table
Theorem for real valued functions on Riemannian surfaces with odd Euler
characteristic. We then use this result to prove the table conjecture for even
functions on the two sphere.

We study automatic sequences and automatic systems generated by general
constant length (nonprimitive) substitutions. While an automatic system is
typically uncountable, the set of automatic sequences is countable, implying
that most sequences within an automatic system are not themselves automatic. We
provide a complete and succinct classification of automatic sequences that lie
in a given automatic system in terms of the quasi-fixed points of the
substitution defining the system. Our result extends to factor maps between
automatic systems and highlights arithmetic properties underpinning these
systems. We conjecture that a similar statement holds for general nonconstant
length substitutions.

The energy-based dual-phase dynamics identification (EDDI) method is a new
data-driven technique for the discovery of equations of motion (EOMs) of
strongly nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillators. This research
uses the EDDI method to obtain mathematical models for SDOF systems with
clearance nonlinearities. The first key aspect of the EDDI method is that it
relates the kinetic energy of the system to the dissipated energy and the
underlying non-conservative forces acting on the oscillator. The second key
aspect is that the EOM is identified with only knowledge of the mass of the
oscillator and the transient response. The first phase of the EDDI method
constructs the dissipated energy from the kinetic energy, then identifies a
mathematical model for the damping based on the dissipated energy. To achieve
this, the moments in time when the displacements are zero, where the mechanical
and kinetic energies are equal, are used to compute the energy dissipated by
the damping of the system. The second phase begins by computing the
conservative force acting on the oscillator from either a balance of the other
forces in the system or through the Lagrange equation. Finally, the stiffness
model is determined by solving a set of linear equations to construct a
mathematical model for the conservative (elastic) force. The governing
equations are discovered by incorporating both the damping and stiffness terms.
The method is demonstrated by employing analytical and real measured responses
of nonlinear SDOF systems with different clearances nonlinearities, which shows
that the proposed approach is suitable for non-smooth mechanical systems as
well as smooth systems.

We give a "lattice-theoretic" description of the global Schubert variety for
$\mathrm{GL}_n$ associated to any dominant coweight.

The integration of operator kernels with the Wigner distribution, first
conceptualized by E. Wigner in 1932 and later extended by L. Cohen and others,
has opened new avenues in time-frequency analysis and operator calculus.
Despite substantial advancements, the presence of ``ghost frequencies" in
Wigner kernels continues to pose significant challenges, particularly in the
analysis of Fourier integral operators (FIOs) and their applications to partial
differential equations (PDEs).
  In this work, we build on the foundational concepts of Wigner analysis to
introduce a novel framework for controlling ghost frequencies through the
combined use of Gaussian and Sobolev regularization techniques. By focusing on
FIOs with non-quadratic phase functions, we develop rigorous estimates for the
Wigner kernels that are crucial for their applicability to Schr\"odinger
equations with non-trivial symbol classes. Unlike previous approaches, our
methodology not only mitigates the interference caused by ghost frequencies but
also establishes robust bounds in the context of generalized symplectic
mappings.

Design exploration or optimization using computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
is commonly used in the industry. Geometric variation is a key component of
such design problems, especially in turbulent flow scenarios, which involves
running costly simulations at every design iteration. While parametric
RANS-PINN type approaches have been proven to make effective turbulent
surrogates, as a means of predicting unknown Reynolds number flows for a given
geometry at near real-time, geometry aware physics informed surrogates with the
ability to predict varying geometries are a relatively less studied topic. A
novel geometry aware parametric PINN surrogate model has been created, which
can predict flow fields for NACA 4 digit airfoils in turbulent conditions, for
unseen shapes as well as inlet flow conditions. A local+global approach for
embedding has been proposed, where known global design parameters for an
airfoil as well as local SDF values can be used as inputs to the model along
with velocity inlet/Reynolds number ($\mathcal{R}_e$) to predict the flow
fields. A RANS formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations with a 2-equation
k-epsilon turbulence model has been used for the PDE losses, in addition to
limited CFD data from 8 different NACA airfoils for training. The models have
then been validated with unknown NACA airfoils at unseen Reynolds numbers.

The phenomenon of collisional breakage in particulate processes has garnered
significant interest due to its wide-ranging applications in fields such as
milling, astrophysics, and disk formation. This study investigates the analysis
of the pure collisional breakage equation (CBE), characterized by its nonlinear
nature with presence of locally bounded collision kernels and singular breakage
kernels. Employing a finite volume scheme (FVS), we discretize the continuous
equation and investigate the weak convergence of the approximated solution of
the conservative scheme towards the continuous solution of CBE. A weight
function is introduced to ensure the conservation of the scheme. The
non-negativity of the approximated solutions is also shown with the assistance
of the mathematical induction approach. Our approach relies on the weak $L^1$
compactness argument, complemented by introducing a stable condition on the
time step.

A longstanding question is to characterize the lattice of supersets (modulo
finite sets), $L^*(A)$, of a low$_2$ computably enumerable (c.e.) set. The
conjecture is that $L^*(A)\cong {E}^*$ the lattice of all c.e. sets. In spite
of claims in the literature, this longstanding question/conjecture remains
open. We contribute to this problem by solving one of the main test cases. We
show that if c.e. $A$ is low$_2$ then $A$ has an atomless, hyperhypersimple
superset.

Heckman-Polychronakos operators form a prominent family of commuting
differential-difference operators defined in terms of the Dunkl operators
$\mathcal D_i$ as $\mathcal P_m= \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i \mathcal D_i)^m$. They have
been known since 1990s in connection with trigonometric
Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Hamiltonian and Jack symmetric polynomials. We
explicitly compute the eigenvalues of these operators for symmetric and
skew-symmetric eigenfunctions, as well as partial sums of eigenvalues for
general polynomial eigenfunctions.

Binary classification tasks with imbalanced classes pose significant
challenges in machine learning. Traditional classifiers often struggle to
accurately capture the characteristics of the minority class, resulting in
biased models with subpar predictive performance. In this paper, we introduce a
novel approach to tackle this issue by leveraging Universum points to support
the minority class within quadratic twin support vector machine models. Unlike
traditional classifiers, our models utilize quadratic surfaces instead of
hyperplanes for binary classification, providing greater flexibility in
modeling complex decision boundaries. By incorporating Universum points, our
approach enhances classification accuracy and generalization performance on
imbalanced datasets. We generated four artificial datasets to demonstrate the
flexibility of the proposed methods. Additionally, we validated the
effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluations on benchmark
datasets, showing superior performance compared to conventional classifiers and
existing methods for imbalanced classification.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based moment closure model
for the linearized Boltzmann equation of semiconductor devices, addressing both
the deterministic and stochastic settings. Our approach leverages neural
networks to learn the spatial gradient of the unclosed highest-order moment,
enabling effective training through natural output normalization. For the
deterministic problem, to ensure global hyperbolicity and stability, we derive
and apply the constraints that enforce symmetrizable hyperbolicity of the
system. For the stochastic problem, we adopt the generalized polynomial chaos
(gPC)-based stochastic Galerkin method to discretize the random variables,
resulting in a system for which the approach in the deterministic case can be
used similarly. Several numerical experiments will be shown to demonstrate the
effectiveness and accuracy of our ML-based moment closure model for the linear
semiconductor Boltzmann equation with (or without) uncertainties.

We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes
with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single
spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where
spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting)
mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity
leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there
is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity
\textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is
dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are
comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the
impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap
state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rushinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire
phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting
interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength,
the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR
phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the
impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the
thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition
between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative
Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity
coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation
competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and
the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.

We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar
operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the
RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection
problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the
AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an
instanton counting parameter, which corresponds to a low-temperature expansion
in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. We
gain analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as
a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract
analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic
superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low
temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.

This article develops and applies results, originally introduced in earlier
work, for the existence of homotopy curves, terminating at a desired solution.
We describe the principal hypotheses and results in section two; right inverse
approximation is at the core of the theory. We apply this theory in section
three to the basic drift-diffusion equations. The carrier densities are not
assumed to satisfy Boltzmann statistics and the Einstein relations are not
assumed. By proving the existence of the homotopy curve, we validate the
underlying computational framework of a predictor/corrector scheme, where the
corrector utilizes an approximate Newton method. The analysis depends on the
assumption of domains of narrow width. However, no assumption is made regarding
the domain diameter.

Recently, the covariant formulation of the geometric bifurcation theory,
developed in a previous paper, has been applied to two elementary problems: the
study of limit cycles of dynamical systems and the second part of Hilbert's
sixteenth problem. First, it has been shown that dynamical systems with more
than one limit cycle are understood to be those in which the scalar curvature
$\mbox{R}$ is positive and its magnitude diverges to infinity at different
singular points. In the second, it has been demonstrated that $n$th-degree
polynomial systems have the maximum number of $2(n-1)(4(n-1)-2)$ limit cycles
with their relative positions determined by the singularities of the magnitude
of $\mbox{R}$, thus providing a successful response to the original Hilbert's
challenge. It is the purpose of this letter to point out that Buzzi and
Novaes's note is incorrect and leads to erroneous results as an immediate
consequence of their superficial reading of our work, the omission of critical
aspects of the GBT to induce doubt, and reliance on incorrect assumptions or
interpretations that deviate from those established in the framework of GBT.

The Bianchi identities for the Weyl curvature tensor of a spacetime $(M, g)$
solving the vacuum Einstein equations in a double null foliation exhibit a
hyperbolic structure, which can be used to obtain detailed nonlinear estimates
on the null Weyl tensor components. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we
discuss existence and uniqueness for solutions of first-order linear hyperbolic
systems of equations in a double null foliation on an arbitrary spacetime, with
initial data posed on a past null hypersurface $\underline C_0 \cup C_0$. We
prove a global existence and uniqueness theorem for these systems. Then we
discuss the relationship between these systems, the Bianchi equations, and the
linearized Bianchi equations (the linearized Bianchi equations are obtained
from the usual Bianchi equations by replacing the null Weyl tensor components
with unknown tensorfields). We derive a novel algebraic constraint which must
be satisfied, at every point in the spacetime, by tensorfields satisfying the
linearized Bianchi equations.

As mission- and safety-critical wireless applications grow in complexity and
diversity, next-generation wireless systems must meet increasingly stringent
and multifaceted requirements. These systems demand resilience along with
enhanced intelligence and adaptability to ensure reliable communication under
diverse conditions. This paper proposes an event-based multi-stage resilience
framework, offering a guideline for efficiently integrating a combination of
error mitigation techniques. The framework is applied to a case study focusing
on uplink transmission of mixed-criticality data in the presence of random link
blockages. The proposed scheme combines multiple blockage mitigation strategies
- rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), one-sided access point cooperation,
and central decoding - within an event-driven algorithm. Each method,
increasing in effectiveness and complexity, is activated sequentially to
systematically overcome blockages. We model a mixed-criticality queuing system
and formulate two transmit power allocation problems, one for separate decoding
and one for central decoding, to ensure queue stability and fairness.
Simulations evaluate the delay performance under varying blockage durations and
examine the cost tradeoffs among resilience mechanisms within the proposed
framework. The results suggest that passive robustness strategies effectively
handle frequent short-term fluctuations, while more complex adaptation becomes
germane for rare and prolonged blockages. Additionally, the results emphasize
the importance of criticality-awareness for resilient communication design.

Quantum mechanics is formulated on a Hilbert space that is assumed to be
separable. However, there seems to be no clear reason justifying this
assumption. Does it have physical implications? We answer in the positive by
proposing a test that witnesses the non-separability of the Hilbert space, at
the expense of requiring measurements with uncountably many outcomes. In the
search for a less elusive manifestation of non-separability, we consider the
original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state as a candidate for possessing
nonlocal correlations stronger than any state in a separable Hilbert space.
Nevertheless, we show that, under mild assumptions, this state is not a vector
in any bipartite space, even non-separable, and therefore cannot be described
within the standard Hilbert space formalism.

The coset construction of two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT)
defines a 2D CFT by taking the quotient of two previously known chiral
algebras. In this work, we use the methods of non-abelian (non-invertible)
anyon condensation to describe 2D topological cosets, defined by the special
case where the quotient of chiral algebras is a conformal embedding. In this
case, the coset has zero central charge, and the coset theory is thus purely
topological. Using non-abelian anyon condensation we describe in general the
spectrum of line and local operators as well as their fusion, operator product
expansion, and the action of the lines on local operators. An important
application of our results is to QCD$_{2}$ with massless fermions in any
representation that leads to a gapped phase, where topological cosets
(conjecturally) describe the infrared fixed point. We discuss several such
examples in detail. For instance, we find that the $Spin(8)_{1}/SU(3)_{3}$ and
$Spin(16)_{1}/Spin(9)_{2}$ topological cosets appearing at the infrared fixed
point of appropriate QCD$_{2}$ theories are described by $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times
\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ triality and $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathrm{Rep(S_{3})}$ fusion
categories respectively. Additionally, using this setup, we argue that chiral
$Spin(8)$ QCD$_{2}$ with massless chiral fermions in the vectorial and
spinorial representations is not only gapped, but moreover trivially gapped,
with a unique ground state.

We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective
measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum
circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep
thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal
ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As
well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that
the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is
close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an
appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying
deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local
matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the
diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to
experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum
statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.

Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of
matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the
generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in
lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a
sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling
local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using
the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants.
Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and
loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations.
The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized
global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on
lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range
entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in
microscopic lattice models.

Transformers, known for their attention mechanisms, have proven highly
effective in focusing on critical elements within complex data. This feature
can effectively be used to address the time-varying channels in wireless
communication systems. In this work, we introduce a channel-aware adaptive
framework for semantic communication, where different regions of the image are
encoded and compressed based on their semantic content. By employing vision
transformers, we interpret the attention mask as a measure of the semantic
contents of the patches and dynamically categorize the patches to be compressed
at various rates as a function of the instantaneous channel bandwidth. Our
method enhances communication efficiency by adapting the encoding resolution to
the content's relevance, ensuring that even in highly constrained environments,
critical information is preserved. We evaluate the proposed adaptive
transmission framework using the TinyImageNet dataset, measuring both
reconstruction quality and accuracy. The results demonstrate that our approach
maintains high semantic fidelity while optimizing bandwidth, providing an
effective solution for transmitting multi-resolution data in limited bandwidth
conditions.

Ends and end cohomology are powerful invariants for the study of noncompact
spaces. We present a self-contained exposition of the topological theory of
ends and prove novel extensions including the existence of an exhaustion of a
proper map. We define reduced end cohomology as the relative end cohomology of
a ray-based space. We use those results to prove a version of a theorem of King
that computes the reduced end cohomology of an end sum of two manifolds. We
include a complete proof of Freudenthal's fundamental theorem on the number of
ends of a topological group, and we use our results on dimension-zero end
cohomology to prove -- without using transfinite induction -- a theorem of
N\"obeling on freeness of certain modules of continuous functions.

In this paper, we construct finite-time type-II blow-up solutions for the
focusing energy-critical wave equation with an inverse-square potential
$$\partial_t^2 u-\Delta u+\frac{\alpha}{|x|^2}u = u^5,$$ with discussions of
the influence of the potential being made. The key ingredients include an
approxiamte construction of solutions and spectral analysis of the linearized
operator, especially the distorted Hankel transform. The construction is based
on the framework established by Krieger-Schlag-Tataru in 2009.

We study a class of semilinear free boundary problems in which admissible
functions $u$ have a topological constraint, or spanning condition, on their
1-level set. This constraint forces $\{u=1\}$, which is the free boundary, to
behave like a surface with some special types of singularities attached to a
fixed boundary frame, in the spirit of the Plateau problem of Harrison-Pugh.
Two such free boundary problems are the minimization of capacity among surfaces
sharing a common boundary and an Allen-Cahn formulation of the Plateau problem.
We establish the existence of minimizers and study the regularity of solutions
to the Euler-Lagrange equations, obtaining the optimal Lipschitz regularity for
solutions and analytic regularity for the free boundaries away from a
codimension two singular set. The singularity models for these problems are
given by conical critical points of the minimal capacity problem, which are
closely related to spectral optimal partition and segregation problems.

Let $X$ be a $n$-dimensional smooth projective variety and $L$ be an ample
Cartier divisor on $X$. We conjecture that a very general element of the linear
system $|K_X+(3n+1)L|$ is a hyperbolic algebraic variety. This conjecture holds
for some classical varieties: surfaces, products of projective spaces, and
Grassmannians. In this article, we investigate the conjecture for $X$ a toric
variety. We give a positive answer to the conjecture for smooth projective
toric varieties. For a Gorenstein toric threefold $X$, we show that $|K_X+9L|$
is a hyperbolic linear system for any ample Cartier divisor $L$.

We elaborate on the method introduced in arXiv:2403.02165 for holographic
duals of Boundary Conformal Field Theories (BCFTs) with multiple boundaries.
Using these advances we calculate the entanglement entropy as a function of
time for 1+1-dimensional CFTs that are split into $N$ subsystems. We give
explicit results for $N = 4$ and $N = 17$. We find that all qualitative
differences that arise for larger $N$ are present for $N = 4$.

The Pauli exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding electronic
quantum systems. It namely constrains the expected occupancies $n_i$ of
orbitals $\varphi_i$ according to $0 \leq n_i \leq 2$. In this work, we first
refine the underlying one-body $N$-representability problem by taking into
account simultaneously spin symmetries and a potential degree of mixedness
$\boldsymbol w$ of the $N$-electron quantum state. We then derive a
comprehensive solution to this problem by using basic tools from representation
theory, convex analysis and discrete geometry. Specifically, we show that the
set of admissible orbital one-body reduced density matrices is fully
characterized by linear spectral constraints on the natural orbital occupation
numbers, defining a convex polytope $\Sigma_{N,S}(\boldsymbol w) \subset
[0,2]^d$. These constraints are independent of $M$ and the number $d$ of
orbitals, while their dependence on $N, S$ is linear, and we can thus calculate
them for arbitrary system sizes and spin quantum numbers. Our results provide a
crucial missing cornerstone for ensemble density (matrix) functional theory.

The Euler-Kronecker constants related to congruences of Fourier coefficients
of modular forms that have been computed so far, involve logarithmic
derivatives of Dirichlet $L$-series as most complicated functions (to the best
of our knowledge). However, generically the more complicated Artin $L$-series
will make their appearance. Here we work out some simple examples involving an
Artin $L$-series related to an ${\mathfrak S}_3$, respectively~${\mathfrak
S}_4$ extension. These examples are related to a mod-2 congruence for
$X_0(11)$, respectively a mod-59 congruence for $\Delta E_4$ conjectured by
Serre and Swinnerton-Dyer and proved by Haberland. The latter example solves a
problem posed by Ciolan, Languasco and the third author in 2023.

We improve the uniformity in the asymptotic Chebotarev density theorem for
Galois extensions of number fields satisfying Artin's holomorphy conjecture.
Using nonabelian base change, this yields an unconditional improvement to the
uniformity in the Chebotarev density theorem along with the first theoretical
improvement over Weiss's bound for the least norm of an unramified prime ideal
in the Chebotarev density theorem.

In this article, we define supersingular Brauer classes in positive
characteristic and study their role in the Brauer-Manin obstruction. We relate
this notion to the Brauer group of supersingular K3 surfaces and use our
results to study the Brauer-Manin set cut out by the $p$-torsion Brauer group.

We develop a version of the Kloosterman circle method with a bump function
that is used to provide asymptotics for weighted representation numbers of
nonsingular integral quadratic forms. Unlike many applications of the
Kloosterman circle method, we explicitly state some constants in the error
terms that depend on the quadratic form. This version of the Kloosterman circle
method uses Gauss sums, Kloosterman sums, Sali\'{e} sums, and a principle of
nonstationary phase. We briefly discuss a potential application of this version
of the Kloosterman circle method to a proof of a strong asymptotic local-global
principle for certain Kleinian sphere packings.

We develop a robust functional analytic framework for adiabatic limits. This
framework consist of a notion of adiabatic Fredholm family, several possible
regularity properties, and an explicit construction that provides finite
dimensional reductions that fit into all common regularization theories. We
show that thhese finite dimensional reductions inherit global continuity and
differentiability properties from the adiabatic Fredholm family. Moreover, we
indicate how to construct adiabatic Fredholm families that describe the
adiabatic limits for the nondegenerate Atiyah-Floer conjecture and
strip-shrinking in quilted Floer theory.

We prove that every closed characteristic of minimal action on the boundary
of a uniformly convex domain in $\R^4$ bounds a disk-like global surface of
section. A corollary is that the cylindrical symplectic capacity of a convex
body in $\R^4$ coincides with the minimal action of a closed generalized
characteristic on its boundary.

We give a canonical basis of theta functions for the Cox ring of two
dimensional Looijenga pairs with affine interior, with structure constants
naive counts of k-analytic disks in the total space of the universal
deformation of the mirror (which, as this is dimension two, is isomorphic to
the log Calabi-Yau surface itself)

For all infinite rings $R$ that are finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$, we
show that Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative answer. This is accomplished
by constructing elliptic curves $E$ without rank growth in certain quadratic
extensions $L/K$. To achieve such a result unconditionally, our key innovation
is to use elliptic curves $E$ with full rational $2$-torsion which allows us to
combine techniques from additive combinatorics with $2$-descent.

We study a censored variant of the data-driven newsvendor problem, where the
decision-maker must select an ordering quantity that minimizes expected overage
and underage costs based only on censored sales data, rather than historical
demand realizations. To isolate the impact of demand censoring on this problem,
we adopt a distributionally robust optimization framework, evaluating policies
according to their worst-case regret over an ambiguity set of distributions.
This set is defined by the largest historical order quantity (the observable
boundary of the dataset), and contains all distributions matching the true
demand distribution up to this boundary, while allowing them to be arbitrary
afterwards. We demonstrate a spectrum of achievability under demand censoring
by deriving a natural necessary and sufficient condition under which vanishing
regret is an achievable goal. In regimes in which it is not, we exactly
characterize the information loss due to censoring: an insurmountable lower
bound on the performance of any policy, even when the decision-maker has access
to infinitely many demand samples. We then leverage these sharp
characterizations to propose a natural robust algorithm that adapts to the
historical level of demand censoring. We derive finite-sample guarantees for
this algorithm across all possible censoring regimes, and show its
near-optimality with matching lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic factors). We
moreover demonstrate its robust performance via extensive numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Multivariate multiplicity codes (Kopparty, Saraf, and Yekhanin, J. ACM 2014)
are linear codes where the codewords are described by evaluations of
multivariate polynomials (with a degree bound) and their derivatives up to a
fixed order, on a suitably chosen affine point set. While good list decoding
algorithms for multivariate multiplicity codes were known in some special cases
of point sets by a reduction to univariate multiplicity codes, a general list
decoding algorithm up to the distance of the code when the point set is an
arbitrary finite grid, was obtained only recently (Bhandari et al., IEEE TIT
2023). This required the characteristic of the field to be zero or larger than
the degree bound, and this requirement is somewhat necessary, since list
decoding this code up to distance with small output list size is not possible
when the characteristic is significantly smaller than the degree.
  In this work, we present an alternate construction, based on divided
differences, that closely resembles the classical multiplicity codes but is
`insensitive to the field characteristic'. We obtain an efficient algorithm
that list decodes this code up to distance, for arbitrary finite grids and over
all finite fields. Notably, our construction can be interpreted as a `folded
Reed-Muller code', which might be of independent interest. The upshot of our
result is that a good `Taylor-like expansion' can be expressed in terms of a
good `derivative-like operator' (a divided difference), and this implies that
the corresponding code admits good algorithmic list decoding.

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over the complex numbers and let
$T\subset G$ be a maximal torus. For any $t\in T$ of finite order and any
irreducible representation $V(\lambda)$ of $G$ of highest weight $\lambda$, we
determine the character $ch(t, V(\lambda))$ by using the Lefschetz Trace
Formula due to Atiyah-Singer and explicitly determining the connected
components and their normal bundles of the fixed point subvariety
$(G/P)^t\subset G/P$ (for any parabolic subgroup $P$). This together with
Wirtinger's theorem gives an asymptotic formula for $ch(t, V(n\lambda))$ when
$n$ goes to infinity.

Let $f$ be a $p$-primitive cusp form of level $p^{4r}$, where local
representation of $f$ be supercuspidal at $p$, $p$ being an odd prime, $r\geq
1$ and $g$ be a Hecke-Maass or holomorphic primitive cusp form for
$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. A subconvex bound for the central values of the
Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions $L(s, f \otimes g )$ is give by $$L(\frac{1}{2}, f
\otimes g ) \ll_{f,g,\epsilon}p^{\frac{23r}{12} +\epsilon}.$$

We extend previous work to the case of $\mathbb{Q}$-divisors. Namely, for
certain parametrically prime holomorphic functions $f$ and $\alpha \geq 0$, we
obtain an explicit expression for the Hodge filtration on
$\mathscr{M}(f^{-\alpha}):=\mathscr{O}_X(*f)f^{-\alpha}$.

In this paper, we generalize the notions of numerical radius parallelism and
numerical radius Birkhoff orthogonality, originally formulated for operators on
Hilbert spaces, to operators on normed spaces. We then proceed to demonstrate
their fundamental properties. Notably, our findings reveal that numerical
radius parallelism lacks transitivity, and numerical radius Birkhoff
orthogonality is neither left nor right additive. Additionally, we offer
characterizations for both concepts. Furthermore, we establish a connection
between numerical radius parallelism and numerical radius Birkhoff
orthogonality.

We study the problem of sampling from and preparing quantum Gibbs states of
local commuting Hamiltonians on hypercubic lattices of arbitrary dimension. We
prove that any such Gibbs state which satisfies a clustering condition that we
coin decay of matrix-valued quantum conditional mutual information (MCMI) can
be quasi-optimally prepared on a quantum computer. We do this by controlling
the mixing time of the corresponding Davies evolution in a normalized quantum
Wasserstein distance of order one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that such a non-commutative transport metric has been used in the
study of quantum dynamics, and the first time quasi-rapid mixing is implied by
solely an explicit clustering condition. Our result is based on a weak
approximate tensorization and a weak modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality
for such systems, as well as a new general weak transport cost inequality. If
we furthermore assume a constraint on the local gap of the thermalizing
dynamics, we obtain rapid mixing in trace distance for interactions beyond the
range of two, thereby extending the state-of-the-art results that only cover
the nearest neighbor case. We conclude by showing that systems that admit
effective local Hamiltonians, like quantum CSS codes at high temperature,
satisfy this MCMI decay and can thus be efficiently prepared and sampled from.

This paper proposes a slot-based energy storage approach for decision-making
in the context of an Off-Grid telecommunication operator. We consider network
systems powered by solar panels, where harvest energy is stored in a battery
that can also be sold when fully charged. To reflect real-world conditions, we
account for non-stationary energy arrivals and service demands that depend on
the time of day, as well as the failure states of PV panel. The network
operator we model faces two conflicting objectives: maintaining the operation
of its infrastructure and selling (or supplying to other networks) surplus
energy from fully charged batteries. To address these challenges, we developed
a slot-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that incorporates positive
rewards for energy sales, as well as penalties for energy loss and battery
depletion. This slot-based MDP follows a specific structure we have previously
proven to be efficient in terms of computational performance and accuracy. From
this model, we derive the optimal policy that balances these conflicting
objectives and maximizes the average reward function. Additionally, we present
results comparing different cities and months, which the operator can consider
when deploying its infrastructure to maximize rewards based on
location-specific energy availability and seasonal variations.

In this study, we define the unit hyper-dual sphere $S_{\mathbb{D} _{2}}$ in
hyper-dual vectors $\mathbb{D}_{2}$ and we give E-Study map version in
$\mathbb{D}_{2}$ which prove that $S_{\mathbb{D} _{2}}^{2} $ is isomorphism to
the tangent bundle $TS_{\mathbb{D} }^{2}.$ Next, we define ruled surfaces in
$\mathbb{D}$, we give its developability condition and a geometric
interpretation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ of any curves in $\mathbb{D}_{2}$. Finally,
we present a relationship between a ruled surfaces set in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and
curves in hyper dual vectors $\mathbb{D}_{2}$. We close each study with
examples.

We further develop the algebraic approach to input/output logic initiated in
\cite{wollic22}, where subordination algebras and a family of their
generalizations were proposed as a semantic environment of various input/output
logics. In particular: we extend the modal characterizations of a finite number
of well known conditions on normative and permission systems, as well as on
subordination, precontact, and dual precontact algebras developed in
\cite{de2024obligations}, to those corresponding to the infinite class of {\em
clopen-analytic inequalities} in a modal language consisting both of positive
and of negative unary modal operators; we characterize the syntactic shape of
first-order conditions on algebras endowed with subordination, precontact, and
dual precontact relations which guarantees these conditions to be the
first-order correspondents of axioms in the modal language above; we introduce
algorithms for computing the first-order correspondents of modal axioms on
algebras endowed with subordination, precontact, and dual precontact relations,
and conversely, for computing the modal axioms of which the conditions
satisfying the suitable syntactic shape are the first-order correspondents;
finally, we extend Celani's dual characterization results between subordination
lattices and subordination spaces to a wider environment which also encompasses
precontact and dual precontact relations, and relative to an infinite class of
first order conditions relating subordination, precontact and dual precontact
relations on distributive lattices. The modal characterizations established in
the present paper pave the way to establishing faithful embeddings for infinite
classes of input/output logics, and hence to their implementation in LogiKEy,
Isabelle/HOL, Lean, or other interactive systems.

Channel Charting is a dimensionality reduction technique that learns to
reconstruct a low-dimensional, physically interpretable map of the radio
environment by taking advantage of similarity relationships found in
high-dimensional channel state information. One particular family of Channel
Charting methods relies on pseudo-distances between measured CSI datapoints,
computed using dissimilarity metrics. We suggest several techniques to improve
the performance of dissimilarity metric-based Channel Charting. For one, we
address an issue related to a discrepancy between Euclidean distances and
geodesic distances that occurs when applying dissimilarity metric-based Channel
Charting to datasets with nonconvex low-dimensional structure. Furthermore, we
incorporate the uncertainty of dissimilarities into the learning process by
modeling dissimilarities not as deterministic quantities, but as probability
distributions. Our framework facilitates the combination of multiple
dissimilarity metrics in a consistent manner. Additionally, latent space
dynamics like constrained acceleration due to physical inertia are easily taken
into account thanks to changes in the training procedure. We demonstrate the
achieved performance improvements for localization applications on a measured
channel dataset

Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) is an emerging protocol designed to
reduce X-ray dose radiation in medical imaging. Traditional Filtered Back
Projection algorithm reconstructions suffer from severe artifacts due to sparse
data. In contrast, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms,
though better at mitigating noise through regularization, are too
computationally costly for clinical use. This paper introduces a novel
technique, denoted as the Deep Guess acceleration scheme, using a trained
neural network both to quicken the regularized MBIR and to enhance the
reconstruction accuracy. We integrate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to
initialize a clever starting guess for a proximal algorithm solving a
non-convex model and thus computing an interpretable solution image in a few
iterations. Experimental results on real CT images demonstrate the Deep Guess
effectiveness in (very) sparse tomographic protocols, where it overcomes its
mere variational counterpart and many data-driven approaches at the state of
the art. We also consider a ground truth-free implementation and test the
robustness of the proposed framework to noise.

This paper presents a booby trap game played between a defender and an
attacker on a search space, which may be a compact subset of Euclidean space or
a network. The defender has several booby traps and chooses where to plant
them. The attacker, aware of the presence of these booby traps but not their
locations, chooses a subset of the space and collects a reward equal to the
measure of the subset. If the attacker does not encounter any booby traps, then
the attacker keeps the reward; otherwise, the attacker gets nothing. The
attacker's objective is to maximize the expected reward, while the defender's
objective is to minimize it. We solve this game in the case that the search
space is a compact subset of Euclidean space, and then turn our attention to
the case where the search space is a network in which the attacker must choose
a connected subset of the network. We solve the game when the network is a
circle or a line. For the case of one booby trap, we solve the game for
2-connected networks, and when the network is a tree we present an upper bound
and a lower bound for the value of the game whose ratio is at most 27/25. We
also present an optimal solution for each player in a few cases where the tree
is a star network.

We prove that the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and a
`lifted' modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation are directly
linearisable, and thus integrable in this sense. There are several versions of
the non-commutative mKP equations, including the two-dimensional
generalisations of the non-commutative modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV)
equation and its alternative form (amKdV). Herein we derive the `lifted' mKP
equation, whose solutions are the natural two-dimensional extension of those
for the non-commutative mKdV equation derived in Blower and Malham. We also
present the log-potential form of the mKP equation, from which all of these
non-commutative mKP equations can be derived. To achieve the integrability
results, we construct the pre-Poppe algebra that underlies the KP and mKP
equations. This is a non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line
generated by the solution (and its partial derivatives) to the linearised form
of the KP and mKP equations. The algebra is endowed with a pre-Poppe product,
based on the product rule for semi-additive operators pioneered by Poppe for
the commutative KP equation. Integrability corresponds to establishing a
particular polynomial expansion in the respective pre-Poppe algebra. We also
present numerical simulations of soliton-like interactions for the
non-commutative KP equation.

Let $\mathcal{A}_g$ be the moduli space of principally polarized abelian
varieties. We study the problem of counting the number of principal
polarizations modulo the natural action of the automorphism group of the
abelian variety on a very general element of a positive dimensional component
of $\mathrm{Sing}(\mathcal{A}_g)$, and show that this number is not always 1.

In this work, we use a new approach to study the spread of an infectious
disease. Indeed, we study a SIR epidemic model with variable infectivity, where
the individuals are distributed over a compact subset $D$ of $\R^d$. We define
empirical measures which describe the evolution of the state (susceptible,
infectious, recovered) of the individuals in the various locations, and the
total force of infection in the population. In our model, the individuals do
not move. We establish a law of large numbers for these measures, as the
population size tends to infinity.

The Nelson model describes non-relativistic particles coupled to a
relativistic Bose scalar field. In this article, we study the renormalized
version of the Nelson model with massless bosons in Davies' weak coupling
limit. Our main result states that the two-body Coulomb potential emerges as an
effective pair interaction between the particles, which arises from the
exchange of virtual excitations of the quantum field.

The set of badly approximable numbers, Bad, is known to be winning for
Schmidt's game and hence has full Hausdorff dimension. It is also known that
the set of inhomogeneously badly approximable numbers has full dimension. We
prove that the set difference also has full dimension using a variant of the
Schmidt game, which we call the rapid game, played on the space of unimodular
grids.

Building on work of Doyle and Hyde on polynomial maps in one variable, we
produce for each odd integer $d \geq 2$ a H\'enon map of degree $d$ defined
over $\mathbb{Q}$ with at least $(d-4)^2$ integral periodic points. This
provides a quadratic lower bound on any conjectural uniform bound for periodic
rational points of H\'enon maps. In contrast with the work of Doyle and Hyde,
our examples also admit integer cycles of large period.

Finster and Mimram have defined a dependent type theory called CaTT, which
describes the structure of omega-categories. Types in homotopy type theory with
their higher identity types form weak omega-groupoids, so they are in
particular weak omega-categories. In this article, we show that this principle
makes homotopy type theory into a model of CaTT, by defining a translation
principle that interprets an operation on the cell of an omega-category as an
operation on higher identity types. We then illustrate how this translation
allows to leverage several mechanisation principles that are available in CaTT,
to reduce the proof effort required to derive results about the structure of
identity types, such as the existence of an Eckmann-Hilton cell.

We study relationships between different relaxed notions of core stability in
hedonic games, which are a class of coalition formation games. Our unified
approach applies to a newly introduced family of hedonic games, called
$\alpha$-hedonic games, which contains previously studied variants such as
fractional and additively separable hedonic games. In particular, we derive an
upper bound on the maximum factor with which a blocking coalition of a certain
size can improve upon an outcome in which no deviating coalition of size at
most $q$ exists. Counterintuitively, we show that larger blocking coalitions
might sometimes have lower improvement factors. We discuss the tightness
conditions of our bound, as well as its implications on the price of anarchy of
core relaxations. Our general result has direct implications for several
well-studied classes of hedonic games, allowing us to prove two open
conjectures by Fanelli et al. (2021) for fractional hedonic games.

We introduce a novel property of bounded Voronoi tessellations that
  enables cycle-free mesh sweeping algorithms. We prove that a
  topological sort of the dual graph of any Voronoi tessellation is
  feasible in any flow direction and dimension, allowing
  straightforward application to discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
  discretisations of first-order hyperbolic partial differential
  equations and the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) without
  requiring flux-cycle corrections.
  We also present an efficient algorithm to perform the topological
  sort on the dual mesh nodes, ensuring a valid sweep ordering. This
  result expands the applicability of DG methods for transport
  problems on polytopal meshes by providing a robust framework for
  scalable, parallelised solutions. To illustrate its effectiveness,
  we conduct a series of computational experiments showcasing a DG
  scheme for BTE, demonstrating both computational efficiency and
  adaptability to complex geometries.

For $G$ a simple, simply-connected complex algebraic group and two dominant
integral weights $\lambda, \mu$, we consider the dimensions of weight spaces
$V_\lambda(\mu)$ of weight $\mu$ in the irreducible, finite-dimensional highest
weight $\lambda$ representation. For natural numbers $N$, the function $N
\mapsto \dim V_{N\lambda}(N\mu)$ is quasi-polynomial in $N$, the stretched
Kostka quasi-polynomial. Using methods of geometric invariant theory (GIT), we
compute the degree of this quasi-polynomial, resolving a conjecture of Gao and
Gao. We also discuss periods of this quasi-polynomial determined by the GIT
approach, and give computational evidence supporting a geometric determination
of the minimal period.

We determine the minimum dilatation $\delta_n$ among pseudo-Anosov braids
with $n$ strands, for large enough values of $n$. This confirms a conjecture of
Venzke that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \delta_n^n = (2+\sqrt{3})^2 \approx 13.928$.
Together with previous work, this also solves the minimum dilatation problem on
the $n$-punctured sphere, for all but $6$ values of $n$.

The aim of the paper is to show the probabilistically strong well-posedness
of rough differential equations with distributional drifts driven by the
Gaussian rough path lift of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter
$H\in(1/3,1/2)$. We assume that the noise is nondegenerate and the drift lies
in the Besov-H\"older space $\mathcal{C}^\alpha$ for some $\alpha>1-1/(2H)$.
The latter condition matches the one of the additive noise case, thereby
providing a multiplicative analogue of Catellier-Gubinelli in the regime
$H\in(1/3,1/2)$.

This paper, being the sequel of [An inverse problem in Polya-Schur theory. I.
Non-genegerate and degenerate operators], studies a class of linear ordinary
differential operators with polynomial coefficients called \emph{exactly
solvable}; such an operator sends every polynomial of sufficiently large degree
to a polynomial of the same degree. We focus on invariant subsets of the
complex plane for such operators when their action is restricted to polynomials
of a fixed degree and discover a connection between this topic and classical
complex dynamics and its multi-valued counterpart. As a very special case of
invariant sets we recover the Julia sets of rational functions.

At present, in lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature schemes,
especially under the standard model, there are very few schemes with tight
security. This paper constructs the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic
signature scheme that achieves tight security against existential
unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) in the standard model.
Furthermore, among existing schemes, the scheme proposed in this paper also
offers certain advantages in terms of public key size, signature length, and
computational cost.

We prove the Gap Theorem for the spectrum of topological modular forms
$\mathrm{Tmf}$. This removes a longstanding circularity in the literature,
thereby confirming the computation of $\pi_\ast \mathrm{tmf}$ from over two
decades ago by Hopkins and Mahowald. Our approach is crucially a modern one,
developing and refining many techniques in synthetic spectra.

For a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan subalgebra
$\mathfrak{h}$ and Weyl group $W$ we consider the category $\text{Perv}(W
\backslash \mathfrak{h})$ of perverse sheaves on $W \backslash \mathfrak{h}$
smooth w.r.t. the natural stratification. We construct a category
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ such that $\text{Perv}(W\backslash \mathfrak{h})$ is
identified with the category of functors from $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ to
vector spaces. Objects of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ are labelled by standard
parabolic subalgebras in $\mathfrak{g}$. It has morphisms analogous to the
operations of parabolic induction (Eisenstein series) and restriction (constant
term) of automorphic forms. In particular, the Langlands formula for the
constant term of an Eisenstein series has a counterpart in the form of an
identity in $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$. We define $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ as
the category of $W$-invariants (in an appropriate sense) in the category $Q$
describing perverse sheaves on $\mathfrak{h}$ smooth w.r.t. the root
arrangement. This matches, in an interesting way, the definition of $W
\backslash \mathfrak{h}$ itself as the spectrum of the algebra of
$W$-invariants.

In this article, we deduce test properties, in the sense of finitely many
vanishing of Ext or Tor, of CM (Cohen-Macaulay) modules whose multiplicity and
number of generators (resp., type) are related by certain inequalities. We
apply these test behaviour, along with other results, to characterize various
kinds of local rings, including hypersurface rings of multiplicity at most two,
via finite vanishing of Ext or Tor involving such CM modules. As further
applications, we verify the long-standing (Generalized) Auslander-Reiten
Conjecture for every CM module of minimal multiplicity.

We study the sequential empirical process indexed by general function classes
and its smoothed set-indexed analogue. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic
equicontinuity and weak convergence are provided for nonstationary arrays of
time series, in terms of uniform moment bounds for partial sums and, for the
set-indexed smoothed process, $L_p$-Lipschitz regularity. This yields
comprehensive general results on the weak convergence of sequential empirical
processes, which are applicable to various notions of dependence. Especially,
we show that our moment conditions imply the weak convergence of the sequential
process under essentially the same mild assumptions (on the degree of
dependence and the complexity of the indexing function class) as known for the
classical empirical process. This is exemplified in detail for nonstationary
$\alpha$-mixing time series. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal
inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments
and suitable pathwise uniform Lipschitz properties.

We investigate the mass-preserving $L^2 $-gradient flow of a generalized
Cahn-Hilliard equation and rigorously justify its sharp interface limit. For
well-prepared initial data, we show that, as the interface width $\varepsilon$
approaches zero, the diffuse interface converges to a volume-preserving
Willmore flow. This result is established for arbitrary spatial dimensions $n$
and applies to a general double-well potential. The proof follows the classical
framework of Alikakos-Bates-Chen on Cahn-Hilliard, combining asymptotic
analysis to construct approximate solutions, spectral analysis to establish
coercivity, and nonlinear estimates to rigorously control the remainder terms.

We show that certain factor rings of the group algebra of a symmetric group
have natural bases of group elements. We also give generators for the
annihilator of certain permutation modules for symmetric groups.

We extend the study of eikonal Hamilton-Jacobi equations posed on networks
performed by Siconolfi and Sorrentino (Anal. PDE, 2018) to a more general
setting. Their approach essentially exploits that such equations correspond to
discrete problems on an abstract underlying graph. However, a specific
condition they assume can be rather restricting in some settings, which
motivates the generalization we propose. We still get an Aubry set, which plays
the role of a uniqueness set for our problem and appears in the representation
of solutions. Exploiting it we establish a new comparison principle between
super and subsolutions to the equation.

In this work, we address three non-convex optimization problems associated
with the training of shallow neural networks (NNs) for exact and approximate
representation, as well as for regression tasks. Through a mean-field approach,
we convexify these problems and, applying a representer theorem, prove the
absence of relaxation gaps. We establish generalization bounds for the
resulting NN solutions, assessing their predictive performance on test datasets
and, analyzing the impact of key hyperparameters on these bounds, propose
optimal choices.
  On the computational side, we examine the discretization of the convexified
problems and derive convergence rates. For low-dimensional datasets, these
discretized problems are efficiently solvable using the simplex method. For
high-dimensional datasets, we propose a sparsification algorithm that, combined
with gradient descent for over-parameterized shallow NNs, yields effective
solutions to the primal problems.

We introduce a novel algorithm for controlling linear time invariant systems
in a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose
realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with
constant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by
conditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The
resulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft
constraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process.
We show theoretically that our controller satisfies asymptotical stability for
the optimal control problem by leveraging general results from Bayesian
inference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.

In this paper we will associate a family $\{K_1,\dots,K_l\}\subset
\mathbb{S}^3$ of iterated torus knots to a given free numerical semigroup. We
will describe the fundamental group of the knot complement of each knot of the
family. Finally, we will show that all knots in the family have same Alexander
polynomial and it coincides (up to a factor) with the Poincar\'e series of the
free numerical semigroup. As a consequence, we will provide families of
iterated torus knots with the same Alexander polynomial of an irreducible plane
curve singularity but which are non-isotopic to its associated knot.

Let $p$ be a prime number and let $d$ be a positive integer. In this paper,
we generalize Iwasawa theory for graphs initiated by Gonet and Valli\`{e}res to
weighted graphs. In particular, we prove an analogue of Iwasawa's class number
formula and that of Kida's formula for compatible systems of
$(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^d$-covers of weighted graphs. We also provide
numerical examples. At the end of this paper, we give an application of the
ideas of Iwasawa theory to the theory of discrete-time quantum walks in graphs.

In practice, low Earth orbit (LEO) and medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite
networks consist of multiple orbits, each populated with many satellites. A
widely used spatial architecture for satellites is the Walker constellation,
where the longitudes of orbits are equally spaced and the satellites are
periodically distributed along the orbits. In this paper, we develop a
stochastic geometry model for Walker constellations by constructing orbits that
are invariant with respect to (w.r.t.) Earth's spin and satellites that are
invariant w.r.t. orbit-wise rotation. This model enables an analysis based on
dynamical systems, which allows one to address structural properties such as
periodicity and ergodicity. It also enables a stochastic geometry analysis
where, for a typical user at a given latitude, we derive the performance of
downlink communications as a function of key constellation parameters,
including orbit inclination and altitude, the number of orbits, the number of
satellites, and the user latitude.

The cosmological polytope of a graph $G$ was recently introduced to give a
geometric approach to the computation of wavefunctions for cosmological models
with associated Feynman diagram $G$. Basic results in the theory of positive
geometries dictate that this wavefunction may be computed as a sum of rational
functions associated to the facets in a triangulation of the cosmological
polytope. The normalized volume of the polytope then provides a complexity
estimate for these computations. In this paper, we examine the (Ehrhart)
$h^\ast$-polynomial of cosmological polytopes. We derive recursive formulas for
computing the $h^\ast$-polynomial of disjoint unions and $1$-sums of graphs.
The degree of the $h^\ast$-polynomial for any $G$ is computed and a
characterization of palindromicity is given. Using these observations, a tight
lower bound on the $h^\ast$-polynomial for any $G$ is identified and explicit
formulas for the $h^\ast$-polynomials of multitrees and multicycles are
derived. The results generalize the existing results on normalized volumes of
cosmological polytopes. A tight upper bound and a combinatorial formula for the
$h^\ast$-polynomial of any cosmological polytope are conjectured.

I prove a sharp bound on reflectionless Dirac operators.

This paper studies discrete-time average-cost infinite-horizon Markov
decision processes (MDPs) with Borel state and action sets. It introduces new
sufficient conditions for validity of optimality inequalities and optimality
equations for MDPs with weakly and setwise continuous transition probabilities.

This paper presents a novel approach for optimal control of nonlinear
stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within
infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework
leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only
control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns
the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an
infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time
evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We
demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex
operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven
solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning
framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward
infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from
synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the
advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical
nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.

We describe the full group of isometries of each left invariant Riemannian
metric on the simply connected unimodular nilpotent or solvable $(R)$-type Lie
groups of dimension four.

In this note, we show a conjecture of Ko{\l}odziej-Tosatti about Morse-type
integrals in nef $(1,1)$ classes on compact Hermitian manifold with bounded
mass property. As a consequence, we give positive answers to
Demailly-P\u{a}un's conjecture and Tosatti-Weinkove's conjecture when compact
Hermitian manifold with bounded mass property.

In this paper, we propose FairML.jl, a Julia package providing a framework
for fair classification in machine learning. In this framework, the fair
learning process is divided into three stages. Each stage aims to reduce
unfairness, such as disparate impact and disparate mistreatment, in the final
prediction. For the preprocessing stage, we present a resampling method that
addresses unfairness coming from data imbalances. The in-processing phase
consist of a classification method. This can be either one coming from the
MLJ.jl package, or a user defined one. For this phase, we incorporate fair ML
methods that can handle unfairness to a certain degree through their
optimization process. In the post-processing, we discuss the choice of the
cut-off value for fair prediction. With simulations, we show the performance of
the single phases and their combinations.

A theorem is proved to verify incremental stability of a feedback system via
a homotopy from a known incrementally stable system. A first corollary of that
result is that incremental stability may be verified by separation of Scaled
Relative Graphs, correcting two assumptions in [1, Theorem 2]. A second
corollary provides an incremental version of the classical IQC stability
theorem.

An analogue of the describing function method is developed using square waves
rather than sinusoids. Static nonlinearities map square waves to square waves,
and their behavior is characterized by their response to square waves of
varying amplitude - their amplitude response. The output of an LTI system to a
square wave input is approximated by a square wave, to give an analogue of the
describing function. The classical describing function method for predicting
oscillations in feedback interconnections is generalized to this square wave
setting, and gives accurate predictions when oscillations are approximately
square.

This paper presents a unified framework for constructing Approximate Message
Passing (AMP) algorithms for rotationally-invariant models. By employing a
general iterative algorithm template and reducing it to long-memory Orthogonal
AMP (OAMP), we systematically derive the correct Onsager terms of AMP
algorithms. This approach allows us to rederive an AMP algorithm introduced by
Fan and Opper et al., while shedding new light on the role of free cumulants of
the spectral law. The free cumulants arise naturally from a recursive centering
operation, potentially of independent interest beyond the scope of AMP. To
illustrate the flexibility of our framework, we introduce two novel AMP
variants and apply them to estimation in spiked models.

We consider the estimation of the parameters $s = (\nu, \alpha_1, \alpha_2,
\cdots, \alpha_T)$ of a cumulative INAR($\infty$) process based on finite
observations under the assumption $\sum_{k=1}^T \alpha_k < 1$ and
$\sum_{k=1}^T\alpha_k^2<\frac12$. The parameter space is modeled as a Euclidean
space $\mathfrak{l}^2$, with an inner product defined for pairs of parameter
vectors. The primary goal is to estimate the intensity function $\Phi_s(t)$,
which represents the expected value of the process at time $t$. We introduce a
Least-Squares Contrast $\gamma_T(f)$, which measures the distance between the
intensity function $\Phi_f(t)$ and the true intensity $\Phi_s(t)$. We further
show that the contrast function $\gamma_T(f)$ can be used to estimate the
parameters effectively, with an associated metric derived from a quadratic
form. The analysis involves deriving upper and lower bounds for the expected
values of the process and its square, leading to conditions under which the
estimators are consistent. We also provide a bound on the variance of the
estimators to ensure their asymptotic reliability.

Simultaneously considering multiple objectives in machine learning has been a
popular approach for several decades, with various benefits for multi-task
learning, the consideration of secondary goals such as sparsity, or
multicriteria hyperparameter tuning. However - as multi-objective optimization
is significantly more costly than single-objective optimization - the recent
focus on deep learning architectures poses considerable additional challenges
due to the very large number of parameters, strong nonlinearities and
stochasticity. This survey covers recent advancements in the area of
multi-objective deep learning. We introduce a taxonomy of existing methods -
based on the type of training algorithm as well as the decision maker's needs -
before listing recent advancements, and also successful applications. All three
main learning paradigms supervised learning, unsupervised learning and
reinforcement learning are covered, and we also address the recently very
popular area of generative modeling.

Accurate and robust modelling of large deformation three dimensional contact
interaction is an important area of engineering, but it is also challenging
from a computational mechanics perspective. This is particularly the case when
there is significant interpenetration and evolution of the contact surfaces,
such as the case of a relatively rigid body interacting with a highly
deformable body. The numerical challenges come from several non-linear sources:
large deformation mechanics, history dependent material behaviour and
slip/stick frictional contact. In this paper the Material Point Method (MPM) is
adopted to represent the deformable material, combined with a discretised rigid
body which provides an accurate representation of the contact surface. The
three dimensional interaction between the bodies is detected though the use of
domains associated with each material point. This provides a general and
consistent representation of the extent of the deformable body without
introducing boundary representation in the material point method. The dynamic
governing equations allows the trajectory of the rigid body to evolve based on
the interaction with the deformable body and the governing equations are solved
within an efficient implicit framework. The performance of the method is
demonstrated on a number of benchmark problems with analytical solutions. The
method is also applied to the specific case of soil-structure interaction,
using geotechnical centrifuge experimental data that confirms the veracity of
the proposed approach.

Exponential small splitting of separatrices in the singular perturbation
theory leads generally to nonvanishing oscillations near a saddle--center point
and to nonexistence of a true homoclinic orbit. It was conjectured long ago
that the oscillations may vanish at a countable set of small parameter values
if there exist a quadruplet of singularities in the complex analytic extension
of the limiting homoclinic orbit. The present paper gives a rigorous proof of
this conjecture for a particular fourth-order equation relevant to the
traveling wave reduction of the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation with the
fifth-order dispersion term.

The solution of systems of linear(ized) equations lies at the heart of many
problems in Scientific Computing. In particular for systems of large dimension,
iterative methods are a primary approach. Stationary iterative methods are
generally based on a matrix splitting, whereas for polynomial iterative methods
such as Krylov subspace iteration, the splitting matrix is the preconditioner.
The smoother in a multigrid method is generally a stationary or polynomial
iteration. Here we consider real symmetric indefinite and complex Hermitian
indefinite coefficient matrices and prove that no splitting matrix can lead to
a contractive stationary iteration unless the inertia is exactly preserved.
This has consequences for preconditioning for indefinite systems and smoothing
for multigrid as we further describe.

In this note, we show that a lightlike hypersurface of an indefinite Sasakian
manifold, which is tangent to structure vector field is not locally symmetric,
semi-symmetric or semi-parallel.

We give a new proof for the existence of spherically symmetric steady states
to the Vlasov-Poisson system, following a strategy that has been used
successfully to approximate axially symmetric solutions numerically, both to
the Vlasov-Poisson system and to the Einstein-Vlasov system. There are several
reasons why a mathematical analysis of this numerical scheme is important. A
generalization of the present result to the case of flat axially symmetric
solutions would prove that the steady states obtained numerically in \cite{AR3}
do exist. Moreover, in the relativistic case the question whether a steady
state can be obtained by this scheme seems to be related to its dynamical
stability. This motivates the desire for a deeper understanding of this
strategy.

Various algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all connected induced
subgraphs of a graph $G=(V,E)$. As a variation we enumerate all
"conn-partitions", i.e. partitions $\Pi$ of $V$ with the property that each
part of $\Pi$ induces a connected subgraph. In another vein, we enumerate all
$X\subseteq V$ which induce a subgraph that is (respectively) chordal,
bipartite, or a forest. Mentioned four algorithms, and two more, run in
ouput-polynomial time (and deliver their fare in compressed fashion). Along the
way we give fresh and short proofs of well-known facts about bipartite graphs
and chordless cycles respectively.

In an optimal control strategy, an important point is to define the cost of
the control. Usually it is added to the control criterion and multiplied by a
small coefficient denoted by $\varepsilon$ which is known as the marginal cost
of the control. The key idea of this paper, is to introduce a smoothing term in
the control cost which aims at reducing the quantity of energy spent and
reducing the oscillations of the control. Then using a so-called asymptotic
control based on the smallness of $\varepsilon$, we construct an exact control
which can be implemented in a close loop. The energy involved in the control
depends mainly on the variation of the control. Therefore it seems natural to
include this quantity (the total variations) in the criterion involved in the
optimal control. This can be done approximately by introducing the $L^1$ norm
of the first order derivative of the control. The control strategy that we
develop in this paper can be applied to such linear models. One important and
new point is that we focus on exact control strategies for a non-differentiable
criterion because of the cost of the control. Following the ideas of Tykhonov
regularization method, it is proved using the so-called asymptotic method based
on the smallness of the marginal cost of the control, that the exact control
suggested is the one which represents the minimum of the marginal cost among
exact controls. Furthermore, and it is the main technical point, it can reduce
the variations of the control with an adequate tuning of the various parameters
of the control loop. We test the method on three examples.

In this paper, we compute sharp bounds for the higher topological complexity
of many planar polygon spaces having small genetic codes. In most of these
cases we show that the $k$-th higher topological complexity of planar polygon
spaces is either $km$ or $km+1$, where $m$ is their dimension.

In human social systems, debates are often seen as a means to resolve
differences of opinion. However, in reality, debates frequently incur
significant communication costs, especially when dealing with stubborn
opponents. Inspired by this phenomenon, this paper examines the impact of
malicious agents on the evolution of normal agents' opinions from the
perspective of opinion evolution cost, and proposes corresponding solutions for
the scenario in which malicious agents hold different opinions in multi-agent
systems(MASs). First, the paper analyzes the negative impact of malicious
agents on the opinion evolution process, revealing the evolutionary cost they
bring, which provides the theoretical foundation for the proposed solution.
Next, based on the process of opinion evolution, a strategy is introduced where
agents dynamically adjust trust values during the opinion evolution process,
gradually isolating malicious agents and achieving this even when malicious
agents are in the majority. Additionally, an evolution rate adjustment
mechanism is introduced, allowing the system to flexibly regulate the evolution
process in complex situations, effectively achieving the trade-off between
opinion evolution rate and cost. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate
that the algorithm can effectively isolate the negative influence of malicious
agents and achieve a balance between opinion evolution costs and convergence
speed.

The purpose of this paper is to present a new class of operators known as
polynomially hypo-EP operators, extending the notation of hypo-EP, $n$-hypo-EP,
and polynomially EP. The paper explores numerous properties and
characterizations of polynomially hypo-EP operators and polynomially EP
operators. In addition, we characterize polynomially hypo-EP operators applying
the adequate operator matrix representations. By employing these findings, we
derive new characterizations of EP, hypo-EP, $n$-EP and $n$-hypo-EP.

In this paper we define a degree for ends of infinite digraphs. The
well-definedness of our definition in particular resolves a problem by Zuther.
Furthermore, we extend our notion of end degree to also respect, among others,
the vertices dominating the end, which we denote as combined end degree. Our
main result is a characterisation of the combined end degree in terms of
certain sequences of vertices, which we call end-exhausting sequences. This
establishes a similar, although more complex relationship as known for the
combined end degree and end-defining sequences in undirected graphs.

We study the Gaussian multiple access channel with random user activity, in
the regime where the number of users is proportional to the code length. The
receiver may know some statistics about the number of active users, but does
not know the exact number nor the identities of the active users. We derive two
achievability bounds on the probabilities of misdetection, false alarm, and
active user error, and propose an efficient CDMA-type scheme whose performance
can be compared against these bounds. The first bound is a finite-length result
based on Gaussian random codebooks and maximum-likelihood decoding. The second
is an asymptotic bound, established using spatially coupled Gaussian codebooks
and approximate message passing (AMP) decoding. These bounds can be used to
compute an achievable trade-off between the active user density and
energy-per-bit, for a fixed user payload and target error rate. The efficient
CDMA scheme uses a spatially coupled signature matrix and AMP decoding, and we
give rigorous asymptotic guarantees on its error performance. Our analysis
provides the first state evolution result for spatially coupled AMP with
matrix-valued iterates, which may be of independent interest. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the promising error performance of the CDMA scheme for
both small and large user payloads, when compared with the two achievability
bounds.

We study the higher expansion properties of locally symmetric spaces, with a
particular focus on octonionic hyperbolic manifolds. We show that codimension
two minimal submanifolds of compact octonionic locally symmetric spaces must
have large volume, at least linear in the volume of the ambient space. As a
corollary we prove linear waist inequalities for octonionic hyperbolic
manifolds in codimension two and construct the first locally symmetric examples
of power-law systolic freedom. We also show that any codimension two
submanifold of small volume can be homotoped to a lower dimensional set. We use
this to prove that branched covers of octonionic hyperbolic manifolds are
stable in the sense of Dinur-Meshulam and to establish a uniform lower bound on
the non-abelian Cheeger constants of octonionic hyperbolic manifolds.
  In a more general setting, we prove that maps from locally symmetric spaces
to low dimensional euclidean spaces admit fibers whose fundamental group has
large exponent of growth. We show as a consequence that cocompact lattices in
$SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ have property $ FA_{\lfloor n/8\rfloor-1}$: any action on a
contractible $CAT(0)$ simplicial complex of dimension at most $ \lfloor
n/8\rfloor -1$ has a global fixed point.

Recently, the construction of finite difference schemes from lattice
Boltzmann schemes has been rigorously analyzed [Bellotti et al. (2022), Numer.
Math. 152, pp. 1-40]. It is thus known that any lattice Boltzmann scheme can be
expressed in terms of a corresponding multi-step finite difference scheme on
the conserved variables. In the present work, we provide counterexamples for
the conjecture that any multi-step finite difference scheme has a unique
lattice Boltzmann formulation. Based on that, we indicate the existence of
equivalence classes for discretized relaxation systems.

A fundamental result in symplectic linear algebra states that for a given
positive semi-definite quadratic form on a symplectic space there exists a
symplectic in which the quadratic form reduces to a normal form. The special
case of the aforementioned result for positive-definite quadratic forms is
known as Williamson's theorem. In this work, we establish necessary and
sufficient conditions on positive semi-definite quadratic forms on a symplectic
space to be simultaneously reduced to their normal forms in a common symplectic
basis. In particular, we establish conditions on 2n x 2n real symmetric
positive-definite matrices to be simultaneously diagonalizable by a symplectic
matrix in the sense of Williamson's theorem. We also discuss some applications
of the main result in quantum information theory and statistical
thermodynamics.

The symmetric inclusion process (SIP) models particles diffusing on a graph
with mutual attraction. We recently showed that, in the log-concave regime
(where diffusivity dominates interaction), the spectral gap of the conservative
SIP matches that of a single particle. In this paper, our main result
demonstrates that this identity generally fails outside this regime, but always
holds for the non-conservative SIP, regardless of the interaction strength.
When this one-particle spectral gap identity breaks down, we derive sharp
bounds for the gap in terms of diffusivity, and reveal a two-particle spectral
gap identity in the vanishing diffusivity limit. Our approach leverages the
rigid eigenstructure of SIP, refined comparisons of Dirichlet forms for
arbitrary diffusivity and particle numbers, and techniques from slow-fast
system analysis. These findings extend to the dual interacting diffusion known
as Brownian energy process, and shed some light on the spectral gap behavior
for related Dirichlet-reversible systems on general, non-mean-field,
geometries.

In this expository note, we show that the blow-up arguments of L. Simon adapt
well to the corresponding Schauder theory of germs used in the study of
singular SPDEs. We illustrate this through some representative examples. As in
the classical PDE framework, the argument relies only on the scaling properties
of the germ semi-norms and the Liouville principle for the operator.

We provide a version of first-order hybrid tense logic with predicate
abstracts and definite descriptions as the only non-rigid terms. It is
formalised by means of a tableau calculus working on sat-formulas. A particular
theory of DD exploited here is essentially based on the approach of Russell,
but with descriptions treated as genuine terms. However, the reductionist
aspect of the Russellian approach is retained in several ways. Moreover, a
special form of tense definite descriptions is formally developed. A
constructive proof of the interpolation theorem for this calculus is given,
which is an extension of the result provided by Blackburn and Marx.

With a view on bilevel and PDE-constrained optimisation, we develop iterative
estimates $\widetilde{F'}(x^k)$ of $F'(x^k)$ for compositions $F :=J \circ S$,
where $S$ is the solution mapping of the inner optimisation problem or PDE. The
idea is to form a single-loop method by interweaving updates of the iterate
$x^k$ by an outer optimisation method, with updates of the estimate by single
steps of standard optimisation methods and linear system solvers. When the
inner methods satisfy simple tracking inequalities, the differential estimates
can almost directly be employed in standard convergence proofs for general
forward-backward type methods. We adapt those proofs to a general inexact
setting in normed spaces, that, besides our differential estimates, also covers
mismatched adjoints and unreachable optimality conditions in measure spaces. As
a side product of these efforts, we provide improved convergence results for
nonconvex Primal-Dual Proximal Splitting (PDPS).

The radial mean bodies of parameter $p>-1$ of a convex body $K \subseteq
\mathbb R^n$ are radial sets introduced in \cite{GZ98} by Gardner and Zhang.
They are known to be convex for $p\geq 0$. We prove that if $K \subseteq
\mathbb R^2$ is a convex body, then its radial mean body of parameter $p$ is
convex for every $p \in (-1,0)$.

Due to the strong nonlinearity and nonholonomic dynamics, despite that
various general trajectory optimization methods have been presented, few of
them can guarantee efficient compu-tation and physical feasibility for
relatively complicated fixed-wing UAV dynamics. Aiming at this issue, this
paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method
for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW), which transcribes the trajectory optimization
into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear
time complexity in each itera-tion to achieve fast trajectory generation.
Through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial
parameterization, the customized trajectory representation is presented, which
implies the equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of
solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and
deduction of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is
transcribed into an uncon-strained, gradient-analytical optimization with
linear time com-plexity to further improve efficiency. The simulation
experi-ments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes
sub-second CPU time against other competitors by orders of magnitude to
generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in ran-domly generated obstacle
environments.

Multi-objective unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems (MUCO) are
in general hard to solve, i.e., the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard
and the outcome set is intractable. In this paper we explore special cases of
MUCO problems that are actually easy, i.e., solvable in polynomial time. More
precisely, we show that MUCO problems with up to two ordinal objective
functions plus one real-valued objective function are tractable, and that their
complete nondominated set can be computed in polynomial time. For MUCO problems
with one ordinal and a second ordinal or real-valued objective function we
present an even more efficient algorithm that applies a greedy strategy
multiple times.

We compute an asymptotic formula for the mixed second moment of the $\mu$-th
and $\nu$-th derivatives of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions over monic,
irreducible polynomials in the function field setting.

This paper presents a novel proof that for any convex cone, the size of
conically independent generators is at most twice that of minimum cardinality
generators. While this result is known for linear spaces, we extend it to
general cones through a decomposition into linear and pointed components. Our
constructive approach leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for computing
minimum cardinality generators of finitely generated cones, improving upon
existing methods that only compute conically independent generators.

A convex lattice set in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is the intersection of a convex set in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ and the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. A well-known theorem of
Doignon states that the Helly number of $d$-dimensional convex lattice sets
equals $2^d$, while a remarkable theorem of B\'ar\'any and Matou\v{s}ek states
that the fractional Helly number is only $d+1$. In this paper we generalize
their result to abstract convexity spaces that are equipped with a suitable
separation property. We also disprove a conjecture of B\'ar\'any and Kalai
about an existence of fractional Helly property for a family of solutions of
bounded-degree polynomial inequalities.

The widely and commonly adopted upper bound on the set size of aperiodic
Z-complementary sets (ZCSs) in the literature has been a conjecture. In this
letter, we provide detailed derivations for this conjectured bound. A ZCS is
optimal when its set size reaches the upper bound. Furthermore, we propose a
new construction of ZCSs based on extended generalized Boolean functions
(EGBFs). The proposed method introduces optimal ZCSs with new parameters.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of negatively regionally proximal
pairs of onto maps which coincides with the set of regionally proximal pair of
$f^{-1}$, whenever $f$ is an homeomorphism and we prove the maximal
equicontinoues factor for any onto map on a locally connected continuum is
monotone. Using this, we prove that if $f$ is a minimal map on a finitely
suslinean continua $X$, then $X$ must be a topological circle and $f$ some
irrational rotation of circle.

Term-forming operators (tfos), like iota- or epsilon-operator, are technical
devices applied to build complex terms in formal languages. Although they are
very useful in practice their theory is not well developed. In the paper we
provide a proof-theoretic formulation of the general approach to tfos provided
independently by several authors like Scott, Hatcher, Corcoran, and compare it
with an approach proposed later by Tennant. Eventually it is shown how the
general theory can be applied to specific areas like Quine's set theory NF.

In this paper, we provide the upper bound and the lower bound of the sum of
the number of spherical face-partition pair of simple spherical polytope $P$
with $p$ facets.

We use a quasilift type construction to obtain some bounds on the depth of
the tensor product of certain modules over a local $\mathcal{TE}$ ring. We
recover a result of Celikbas, Sadeghi, and Takahashi for local complete
intersection rings. Some general conditions for lifting hulls and
approximations are also studied.

In this paper, we present a novel analysis of FedAvg with constant step size,
relying on the Markov property of the underlying process. We demonstrate that
the global iterates of the algorithm converge to a stationary distribution and
analyze its resulting bias and variance relative to the problem's solution. We
provide a first-order expansion of the bias in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Interestingly, this bias decomposes into two distinct
components: one that depends solely on stochastic gradient noise and another on
client heterogeneity. Finally, we introduce a new algorithm based on the
Richardson-Romberg extrapolation technique to mitigate this bias.

This paper discusses the approximate controllability of a fractional
differential control problem driven by a nonlinear hemivariational inequality
in a Hilbert space. First, we prove the existence of a mild solution for a
fractional control inclusion problem which is equivalent to a hemivariational
inequality by using the nonsmooth analysis and fixed point technique. Further,
we established sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of our
inclusion problem by taking corresponding linear system is approximately
controllable. The existence and controllability results obtained for the
inclusion problem are valid for considered nonlinear hemivariational problem.
Finally, we provide an example to illustrate the efficiency of the developed
results.

We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with
locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational
formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant measure for the
associated weakly ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment
estimates for the solutions and the so-called $e$-property of the semigroup.
Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations,
shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat
equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic
Burgers equation.

In this work, we establish a deformation-based framework for learning
solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains. The union of functions
defined on varying domains can be identified as a metric space according to the
deformation, then the solution mapping is regarded as a continuous
metric-to-metric mapping, and subsequently can be represented by another
continuous metric-to-Banach mapping using two different strategies, referred to
as the D2D framework and the D2E framework, respectively. We point out that
such a metric-to-Banach mapping can be learned by neural networks, hence the
solution mapping is accordingly learned. With this framework, a rigorous
convergence analysis is built for the problem of learning solution mappings of
PDEs on varying domains. As the theoretical framework holds based on several
pivotal assumptions which need to be verified for a given specific problem, we
study the star domains as a typical example, and other situations could be
similarly verified. There are three important features of this framework: (1)
The domains under consideration are not required to be diffeomorphic, therefore
a wide range of regions can be covered by one model provided they are
homeomorphic. (2) The deformation mapping is unnecessary to be continuous, thus
it can be flexibly established via combining a primary identity mapping and a
local deformation mapping. This capability facilitates the resolution of large
systems where only local parts of the geometry undergo change. (3) If a
linearity-preserving neural operator such as MIONet is adopted, this framework
still preserves the linearity of the surrogate solution mapping on its source
term for linear PDEs, thus it can be applied to the hybrid iterative method. We
finally present several numerical experiments to validate our theoretical
results.

Finding the chromatic number of large graphs is known to be NP-hard. Although
various algorithms have been developed to efficiently compute chromatic
numbers, they still take an enormous amount of time for large graphs. In this
paper, we propose the recurrence relation to obtain the expected value of the
chromatic number of random graphs in a short time.

Solar Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-based power generation plants leverage
solar irradiation to produce thermal energy, offering a highly compatible
renewable technology due to the alignment between solar irradiation
temperatures and ORC operating requirements. Their superior performance
compared to steam Rankine cycles in small-scale applications makes them
particularly relevant within the smart grid and microgrid contexts. This study
explores the role of ORC in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading within
renewable-based community microgrids, where consumers become prosumers,
simultaneously producing and consuming energy while engaging in virtual trading
at the distribution system level. Focusing on a microgrid integrating solar ORC
with a storage system to meet consumer demand, the paper highlights the
importance of combining these technologies with storage to enhance
predictability and competitiveness with conventional energy plants, despite
management challenges. A methodology based on operations research techniques is
developed to optimize system performance. Furthermore, the impact of various
technological parameters of the solar ORC on the system's performance is
examined. The study concludes by assessing the value of solar ORC within the
transactive energy trading framework across different configurations and
scenarios. Results demonstrate an average 16\% reduction in operational costs,
showcasing the benefits of implementing a predictable and manageable system in
P2P transactive energy trading.

This paper examines impulsive controls related to nonautonomous impulsive
integro-differential equations in Hilbert space, highlighting their
significance. We establish the existence of the mild solution by using fixed
point approach and present conditions for approximate controllability using
impulsive resolvent operators and the adjoint problem, supported by an
illustrative example.

This study examines the impact of lifelong learning on the professional lives
of employed and unemployed individuals. Lifelong learning is a crucial factor
in securing employment or enhancing one's existing career prospects. To achieve
this objective, this study proposes the implementation of a multi-criteria
decision support system for the evaluation of training courses in accordance
with their capacity to enhance the employability of the students. The
methodology is delineated in four stages. Firstly, a `working life curve' was
defined to provide a quantitative description of an individual's working life.
Secondly, an analysis based on K-medoids clustering defined a control group for
each individual for comparison. Thirdly, the performance of a course according
to each of the four predefined criteria was calculated using a t-test to
determine the mean performance value of those who took the course. Ultimately,
the unweighted TOPSIS method was used to evaluate the efficacy of the various
training courses in relation to the four criteria. This approach effectively
addresses the challenge of using extensive datasets within a system while
facilitating the application of a multi-criteria unweighted TOPSIS method. The
results of the multi-criteria TOPSIS method indicated that training courses
related to the professional fields of administration and management, hostel and
tourism and community and sociocultural services have positive impact on
employability and improving the working conditions of citizens. However,
courses that demonstrate the greatest effectiveness in ranking are the least
demanded by citizens. The results will help policymakers evaluate the
effectiveness of each training course offered by the regional government.

In a series of papers in the 1960's, S. G\"ahler defined and investigated
so-called m-metric spaces and their topological properties. An m-metric assigns
to any tuple of m+1 elements a real value (more generally an element in a
partially odered set) which satisfies the generalized metric axioms of
semidefiniteness, symmetry, and simplex inequality. In this contribution we
consider a new type of generalized metric which is based on the Vandermonde
determinant. We present some remarkable geometric consequences of the
corresponding simplex inequality in the complex plane. Then we show that the
Vandermonde principle of construction extends to linear spaces of arbitrary
dimension by using symmetric multilinear maps of degree m(m + 1)/2. In
particular, we analyze when this generalized metrics has the stronger property
of definiteness. Finally, an application is provided to the m-metric of point
sets when driven by the same linear ordinary differential equation.

In this paper, we explore the use of the Virtual Element Method concepts to
solve scalar and system hyperbolic problems on general polygonal grids. The new
schemes stem from the active flux approach \cite{AF1}, which combines the usage
of point values at the element boundaries with an additional degree of freedom
representing the average of the solution within each control volume. Along the
lines of the family of residual distribution schemes introduced in
\cite{Abgrall_AF,abgrall2023activefluxtriangularmeshes} to bridge the active
flux technique, we devise novel third order accurate methods that rely on the
VEM technology to discretize gradients of the numerical solution by means of a
polynomial-free approximation, hence adopting a virtual basis that is locally
defined for each element. The obtained discretization is globally continuous,
and for nonlinear problems it needs a stabilization which is provided by the
\textit{a posteriori} MOOD paradigm \cite{Mood1}. This is applied to both point
and average values of the discrete solution. We show applications to scalar
problems, as well as to the acoustics and Euler equations in 2D. The accuracy
and the robustness of the proposed schemes are assessed against a suite of
benchmarks involving smooth solutions, shock waves and other discontinuities.

The aim of this work is to weaken the conditions of monogenity for functions
that take values in subspaces of one concrete three-dimensional commutative
algebras over the field of complex numbers. The monogenity of the function
understood as a combination of its continuity with the existence of a Gato
derivative.

Optimal control problems for nonsmooth dynamical systems governed by
differential variational inequalities (DVI) are called optimal control problems
with equilibrium constraints (OCPEC). It provides a general formalism for
nonsmooth optimal control. However, solving OCPEC using the direct method
(i.e., first-discretize-then-optimize) is challenging owing to the lack of
correct sensitivity and constraint regularity. This study uses the direct
method to solve OCPEC and overcomes the numerical difficulties from two
aspects: In the discretization step, we propose a class of novel approaches
using gap functions to smooth the DVI, where gap functions are initially
proposed for solving variational inequalities. The generated smoothing
approximations of discretized OCPEC are called gap-constraint-based
reformulations, which have a concise and semismoothly differentiable constraint
system; In the optimization step, we propose an efficient dynamical system
approach to solve the discretized OCPEC, where a sequence of
gap-constraint-based reformulations is solved approximately. This dynamical
system approach involves a semismooth Newton flow and achieves local
exponential convergence under standard assumptions. The benchmark test shows
that the proposed method is computationally tractable and achieves fast local
convergence.
