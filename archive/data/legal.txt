This documentlists the minimum requirements for suppliers of Siemens Medical Solutions describing· how parts, components and systems are identified with their attributes and· how attributes are labeled both as plain text as well as barcode on products and its packaging. Detailed specifications with regards to the labelingof products are defined for the individual product concerned.2 Definitions and abbreviations2.1 Material No.The Siemens Medical Solutions Material No. is used to uniquely identify products (parts, components and systems). It consists of an 8-digitidentification no. assigned by Siemens Medical Solutions.Previously, the term "Part no." was also used; it is replaced by the term "Material No.".2.2 RevisionThe Revision (abbreviated "Rev.") serves to distinguish between different update statuses of hardware. It is assigned by Siemens MedicalSolutions.The English term "Revision" replaces the German term "Erzeugnisstand" (abbreviated "ES") and "Ausführungsstand" (abbreviated "AS").2.3 Serial No.The Serial No. is an identifying attribute used to uniquely identify hardware or software with the same Material No. .For suppliers the Serial No. can consist of up to 15 alphanumeric digits; it is however recommended to use only a 6 digit numerical Serial No. wherepossible.The Serial No. may contain a dash (-) or a slash (/), but no other special characters (e.g. # + * ?). Spaces, lower-case letters or language-specificcharacters (e.g. Ä, Ö, Ü) are not allowed within the Serial No. .The characters "L", "SxxL" or "Sxx" at the end or the beginning of the Serial No. should be avoided (xx = any alphanumerical character).For any Serial No. that is numeric only (i.e. has no letters) it is allowed to omit printing of leading zeros („0").It is recommended to use the Serial No. of the supplier if it complies with the principles described above.2.4 Data IdentifierData Identifiers are used in the barcode to indicate that the information following the Data Identifier is data of a certain attribute. The DataIdentifier enables the barcode reading program to recognize that the following information represents a certain type of attribute.Data Identifiers to be used:31PMaterial No.2PRevision (for packaging only)SSerial No.QQuantity (for packaging only)14DExpiration date (for packaging only)TBatch (for packaging only)2.5 Expiration dateThe format of the expiration date shall be definite and specified as follows: YYYYMMDD2.6 BatchThe batch is an alphanumeric ident number with 10 digits, used to identify parts manufactured or shipped together. Is no batch provided on thepacking but required, a batch is initiated in the stock.2.7 Shelf lifeIf a shelf life is defined for parts the shelf life has to be filed in calendar days. (365 days per year)3 Reference documentsn.a.4 Requirements4.1 Identification of parts, components and systemsNon-serialized parts (including spare parts) and components are identified using a Material No. . If necessary, different statuses of a part,component or system can be distinguished via the Revision.Serialized parts, components and systems are identified using the combination of Material No. and Serial No. . In addition, the Revision may beused to distinguish between different statuses of hardware.4.2 Labeling of parts, components, systems and its packagingIn general, requirements with respect to labeling have to be defined for the product concerned. However, minimum requirements are specified inorder to allow proper identification throughout all processes involved. This chapter lists those minimum requirements.For all material numbers specified by Siemens the parts and its packaging have to be labeled according to the requirements listed below. The labeldepends on whether a part/component/system· is serialized· contains a revision level· is classified as an IVK ("Installed Volume Component")· shall be handled by expiration date or batchSiemens defines those requirements per individual Material No. .45ColorUsually white label with black printing other colors are allowed as long as barcode/plain textcan be readBarcode content1P <Material No. >S <Serial No.>Additionally for packaging only2P <product Revision>Q <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1>It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels!e.g.: 1P01234567 as barcode *) (1P) Model No. 01234567S1001 as barcode *) (S) Serial No. 1001Each symbol structure with start and stop character including Data Identifier (e.g. "1P" or"S"), but without symbol check character.No space allowed between Data Identifier and attribute.It is not allowed to print any other information in the barcode fields described above.Barcode typeCode 39 according to ISO/IEC 16388Narrow element (bar or space)Min. 0,17 mmRatio of wide element to narrow elementMin. 2,25 : 1Barcode heightMin. 2 mm, typical 4mmPlain text (below barcode)(1P) Model No.: <Material No.>(S) Serial No.: <Serial No.>Additionally for packaging only(2P) Revision: <product Revision>(Q) Quantity: <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1>It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels!Data Identifier (e.g. "1P" or "S") in brackets in front of data element title (e.g. ''Model No."or "Serial No.") in plain text!e.g.: (1P) Model No.: 01234567 *) (1p) Model No. 01234567(S) Serial No.: 1001 *) (S) Serial No. 1001Note: Due to 21CFR1020.30 section e) the term "Model No." shall be used instead of theterm "Material No." in plain text on all labels.It is not allowed to print any other information near the data fields described above. If anyother information is printed, it must be printed in a manner so that it can't be misinterpretedas being part of the fields described above; this can be done by printing other information atthe very right side of the label.Additionally for products onlyFor IVKs or System IVKs, the text "IVK" or "SYSTEM IVK" shall be printed on the veryright side of the label. It has to be ensured that this text can't be misinterpreted as being partof the Serial No. ; this can be done by printing this text on a different level. [SiemensMedical Solutions decides and specifies whether a product is an IVK or System IVK.]Additionally for packing onlyThe Expiration date of parts with Shelf life is fixed below the quantity as following:Expiration date: <date of expiration> YYYYMMDDFor parts which require a Batch, the batch is fixed below the Expiration date as following:AAAAAAAAAAFor a transition period the batch can also be fixed above the material numberFontUniverse, if not possible use similar font (e.g. Helvetica)*) In case of limited space, it is possible to print the bar code next to (and not under) the clear text.4.3 SpacingMinimum distances are:5) Expiration date and 6) Batch can be printed in barcode additionally.(A)Horizontal distance from edge (quiet zone)>5 mm(B)Vertical distance from edge>2 mm(C)Vertical distance between printing areas>1 mmLegend:a) printing area for barcodeb) printing area for plain textFor a transition period the batch can also be fixed above the material number65 Basic requirements for packagingEspecially for spare parts appropriate packaging are required for the global shipping process.

Subject and Scope of Agreement1.1 The initial scope of the Alliance will consist of the Studies described in Exhibit I, the details of which are to be mutually agreed upon by the JSC from time to time in accordance with Sections 1.5 - 1.8 below). The Studies and/or the scope of the Alliance may be replaced and/or changed as agreed upon by the JSC.

Each Study Order shall be substantially in the form attached as Exhibit III to this Agreement and shall detail the specifics of the Study to be performed under such Study Order including, without limitation, (i) the detailed Protocol or workscope, (ii) the Principal Investigator and (iii) identify any project-specific resources or support provided by Adaptimmune. In the event of any conflict of terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, unless the Study Order specifically and expressly supersedes this Agreement with respect to a specific term, and then only with respect to the particular Study Order and specific term. If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms contained in a Protocol or workscope and this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order, the terms of the Protocol or workscope shall govern and control with respect to clinical/scientific matters and the terms of the Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order in that order shall govern and control with respect to all other matters, e.g., legal and financial matters.1.3 Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term ("Alliance Funding").

Each Party can appoint and replace its representatives in the JSC at its own discretion through timely written notice to the other Party.1.6 The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting). The JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote with each of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune exercising one vote each provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at least two representatives of each Party (including for this purpose any proxy representative appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting.If a member of the JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead.

Although decision will be made by mutual agreement of the JSC, in the event of any disagreement, ***.1.7 The main task of the JSC will be to oversee the Alliance. In order to achieve the objectives of the Alliance, the JSC will oversee each Study under the Alliance. The JSC will provide technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance to the Studies and will be responsible for monitoring progress of these Studies. Additional representatives can be invited by the JSC on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics require so, provided that such guests will be subject to an obligation of confidentiality and non-use at least as strict as Section 5 below. In the event a Study is terminated early or does not initiate, the Parties shall promptly replace that Study with a new study similar in scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties. Once agreed by the JSC, such replacement study will be funded by the Alliance Funding and payable in accordance with agreed milestones for such replacement study.***Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission.31.8 In addition, the JSC will be responsible for coordinating resolution of problems arising in the Studies or in the Alliance as a whole. In the event of any matter to which the JSC cannot reach resolution, or in the event of any dispute arising as to any matter subject to JSC responsibility and save where Adaptimmune has the deciding vote in accordance with Section 1.6 above, such matter or dispute will be escalated to executive management of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune for good faith resolution.

Payments4.1 Payments of Alliance Funding applicable to a Study will be made according to the terms specified in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 above.5. Confidential Information75.1In conjunction with each Study, the Parties may wish to disclose confidential information to each other.For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means confidential, non-public information, know-how and data (technical or non-technical) that is disclosed in writing, orally, graphically, in machine readable form, or in any other manner by or on behalf of a disclosing Party to a receiving Party or its Affiliates for purposes of this Agreement or any Study Order ("Purpose"). Data or Inventions arising in the performance of the Study and which are owned by Adaptimmune will also constitute Confidential Information of Adaptimmune, even where first disclosed by MD Anderson and in each case subject to the publication rights of MD Anderson in Section 12 and subject to Section 7 below. Confidential Information may be disclosed in any form (e.g. oral, written, graphic, electronic or sample) by or on behalf of disclosing Party or its Affiliates, or may be otherwise accessible to receiving Party or its Affiliates. Exchanges of Confidential Information directly between the Affiliates and Joint Research Partners are also covered by this Agreement. "Affiliates" means any individual, company, partnership or other entity which directly or indirectly, at present or in the future, controls, is controlled by or is under common control of a Party, and "control" will mean direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least fifty per cent (50%) of the voting share capital in such company or other business entity, or to hold the effective power to appoint or dismiss members of the management.5.2 Without disclosing Party's prior written consent, receiving Party will: (a) not use any part of or the whole of the Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Purpose; (b) restrict the dissemination of Confidential Information to individuals within its own organization and disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its officers, employees and Affiliates and Joint Research Partners who have a legitimate need to have access to the Confidential Information, who will be bound by confidentiality and non-use commitments no less restrictive than those of this Agreement, and who will have been made aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; (c) protect the Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination, or publication of the Confidential Information as receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature; (d) preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, not disclose it to any third party, and take all necessary and reasonable precautions to prevent such information from being accessible to any third party; and (f) promptly notify the disclosing Party upon becoming aware of evidence or suspicion of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. The foregoing obligations will exist for a period of *** (***) years from the date of completion of the last Study in relation to which the Confidential Information is disclosed or used.5.3 The obligations of confidentiality and non-use listed in this Section 5 will not apply to information: (a) which is in the public domain or public knowledge at the time of disclosure, or which subsequently enters the public domain through no fault of receiving Party; (b) which was rightfully in the possession of receiving Party at the time of disclosure by disclosing Party; (c) which is independently developed by receiving Party without use of disclosing Party's Confidential Information; (d) which the receiving Party receives legally from any third party and which is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality; (e) is communicated to the receiving party's IRB or other scientific committee; (f) is required to be disclosed in order to obtain informed consent from patients or subjects who may wish to enroll in the Study, provided, however, that the information will be disclosed only to the extent necessary and will not be provided in answer to unsolicited inquiries by telephone or to individuals who are not eligible to be Study subjects; or (g) is disclosed to a Study subject for the safety or well-being of the Study subject. The receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information of any other Party where it is required to disclose such pursuant to Applicable Law; provided, however, that receiving Party will make reasonable efforts, if legally permissible, to (i) notify disclosing Party prior to the disclosure of any part of or the whole of the Confidential Information and (ii) allow disclosing Party the opportunity to***Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission.8contest and avoid such disclosure, and provided, further, that receiving Party will disclose only that portion of such Confidential Information that it is legally required to disclose.5.4 For the purposes of this Section 5, any combination of features disclosed to the receiving Party will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are. Moreover, specific disclosures made to the receiving Party will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because they are embraced by general disclosures.5.5 All Confidential Information disclosed to receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement will be and remain the disclosing Party's property. Nothing contained herein will be construed as granting to receiving Party any proprietary right on or in relation to any part of or the whole of the Confidential Information, or any right to use any of the Confidential Information except for the Purpose. Receiving Party will return to disclosing Party all documents and other materials which constitute Confidential Information, as well as all copies thereof, promptly upon request or upon termination of this Agreement (whichever is earlier); provided, however, that receiving Party may keep one copy of the Confidential Information received under this Agreement in its secure files in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for the sole purpose of maintaining a record of the Confidential Information received hereunder and for compliance with this Agreement and/or Applicable Laws.5.6 Adaptimmune will not require MD Anderson to disclose any Protected Health Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Adaptimmune comes into knowledge or possession of any "Protected Health Information" (as such term is defined under HIPAA) by or through MD Anderson or any information that could be used to identify any Study subject or other MD Anderson patients or research subjects, Adaptimmune will maintain any such Protected Health Information or other information confidential in accordance with laws and regulations as applicable to MD Anderson, including without limitation HIPAA, will use any such Protected Health Information solely to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the IRB and the Consent/Authorization of the patient/research subject, and will not use or disclose any such Protected Health Information or other information in any manner that would constitute a violation of any Applicable Laws or regulation if such use or disclosure was made by MD Anderson. It is intended that MD Anderson will not disclose any Protected Health Information to Adaptimmune under this Agreement.5.7 Improper use or disclosure of the Confidential Information by receiving Party is likely to cause substantial harm to disclosing Party. Therefore, in the event of a breach, threatened breach, or intended breach of this Agreement by receiving Party, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity, disclosing Party will be entitled to seek preliminary and final injunctions enjoining and restraining such breach, threatened breach, or intended breach.6. Clinical Data / Monitoring6.1 MD Anderson shall maintain complete, accurate and current records with respect to the conduct of any Study as set forth in any Protocol or Study Order, to the extent required by Applicable Laws and regulations ("Study Records").

The alliance will also drive research and development of other new SPEAR TCR therapies to targets in other tumor types such as breast cancers and facilitate clinical study participation by MD Anderson in other Adaptimmune trials. Access to MD Anderson's tumor repository will guide further target selection and clinical trial design, while its cancer immunology cores and expertise in performing translational medicine studies may help optimize the efficacy and safety of SPEAR T-cell therapies."At MD Anderson, we are focused on providing the best possible care for cancer patients, including implementing important new technologies and treatment modalities," said Elizabeth Mittendorf, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of Breast Surgical Oncology.David Hong, M.D., associate professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at MD Anderson added, "It is our hope this alliance will allow us to address numerous solid tumors and augment the patient's immune system, directing it against tumors based on their specific molecular makeup.""We believe that this strategic alliance will provide a strong partnership for the development of multiple new first and subsequent generation SPEAR T-cell therapies against many intractable solid tumors in our near-term clinical programs," commented Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune's chief medical officer. "It will also generate invaluable data from patient samples that will help us understand these therapies and design the next generation of studies. We are very proud to form this alliance with the outstanding team of cancer immunologists at MD Anderson, and are confident that together we can move these novel immunotherapeutic candidates forward for patients who are fighting a variety of cancers."About MD AndersonThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ranks as one of the world's most respected centers focused on cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. The institution's sole mission is to end cancer for patients and their families around the world. MD Anderson is one of only 45 comprehensive cancer centers designated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). MD Anderson is ranked No.1 for cancer care in U.S. News & World Report's "Best Hospitals" survey. It has ranked as one of the nation's top two hospitals since the survey began in 1990, and has ranked first for nine of the46past 10 years. MD Anderson receives a cancer center support grant from the NCI of the National Institutes of Health (P30 CA016672).About AdaptimmuneAdaptimmune is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapy products based on its SPEAR® (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform. Established in 2008, the company aims to utilize the body's own machinery - the T-cell - to target and destroy cancer cells by using engineered, increased affinity TCRs as a means of strengthening natural patient T-cell responses. Adaptimmune's lead program is a SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the NY-ESO cancer antigen. Its NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated signs of efficacy and tolerability in Phase 1/2 trials in solid tumors and in hematologic cancer types, including synovial sarcoma and multiple myeloma. Adaptimmune has a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for the development and commercialization of the NY-ESO TCR program. In addition, Adaptimmune has a number of proprietary programs. These include SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting the MAGE-A10 and AFP cancer antigens, which both have open INDs, and a further SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the MAGE-A4 cancer antigen that is in pre-clinical phase with IND acceptance targeted for 2017. The company has identified over 30 intracellular target peptides preferentially expressed in cancer cells and is currently progressing 12 through unpartnered research programs. Adaptimmune has over 250 employees and is located in Oxfordshire, U.K. and Philadelphia, USA.

If during the term of this Agreement any situation or circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company's General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s). If requested by the Company's General Counsel, Consultant will recuse herself from providing Services for the duration of the conflict.9. Material Non-Public Information.

With respect to any Infringement Claim, the Parties shall attempt to negotiate in good faith a resolution with respect thereto. If the Parties cannot settle such Infringement Claim with the appropriate Third Parties within [***] ([***]) days after the receipt of the notice pursuant to this Section 9.4.1, then the following shall apply:(a) In the case of any such claim against Aimmune alone or against both Aimmune and Xencor, in each case, with respect to the Antibody or Product, then Aimmune shall be deemed to be the "Controlling Party" for purposes of such Infringement Claim.

Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Party's intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.12.1.3 Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential Information of the other Party only to (i) the receiving Party's attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party's Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, actual or potential acquirers, sublicensees and subdistributors of such Affiliates, who have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the 37Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020activities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential Information as required under this Section 12.1.For clarity, either Party may disclose without any limitation such Party's U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions relating to such Party that are based on or derived from this Agreement, as well as all materials of any kind (including opinions, other tax analyses, or a complete copy of this Agreement and any amendments thereto) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.12.1.4 Each Party acknowledges that a Party in breach of any of its obligations under this Section 12.1 shall cause the non-breaching Party irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of bond or other security.12.2 Publicity. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties shall each issue the applicable press release in the form attached hereto as Schedule 12.2, with respect to this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, any press releases or other public statements or disclosures regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to the express prior written consent of each of the Parties; provided that a disclosure shall be permitted without the other Party's consent to the extent that it does not contain information beyond that included in a prior disclosure approved in writing by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party's counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although, prior to any such legally required disclosure by a Party, such Party shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to give the other Party reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.12.3 Securities Filings.

(Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb®7195 from Xencor, Inc.XmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT™) programs, including PALFORZIA™ , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies."As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways," said Jayson Dallas, M.D., President and CEO of Aimmune. "In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.""Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy," said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xencor. "AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies."Under the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238 newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones — beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial — and is eligible to receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.About AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb®7195)AIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic responseSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020in patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.About AimmuneAimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for patients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company's Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT™) approach is intended to provide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with defined, precise amounts of key allergens.

(NASDAQ:XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases, announced it has granted an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb®7195 to Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.XmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT™) programs, including PALFORZIA™ , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies."As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways," said Jayson Dallas, M.D., president and CEO of Aimmune. "In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.""Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy," said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xencor. "AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies."Under the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238 newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share, the seven-day volume weighted average price. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones - beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial - and is eligible to receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.About AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb®7195)AIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response in patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020About Xencor, Inc.Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Currently, 15 candidates engineered with Xencor's XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor's XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.

Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.10.2Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:(1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.(This "trade secret" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)10.3Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.10.4Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.10.5All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 1310.6Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.10.7Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.10.8The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.10.9If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.10.10Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.10.11After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 1410.12 During the performance of
