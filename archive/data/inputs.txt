\title{Quantum Error Mitigation in NISQ Devices}
\begin{abstract}
We present a novel approach to error mitigation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. 
Our method introduces a scaling framework for quantum channels that preserves gate fidelity while reducing environmental noise.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Recent advances in NISQ devices have demonstrated both promise and limitations in quantum computation. 
The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to

1.\title{Information Flow in Complex Ecological Networks}
\begin{abstract}
We present an entropy-based framework for quantifying resilience in food webs and mutualistic networks.
\end{abstract}
\section{Network Analysis}
Consider an ecological network with $n$ species. The information flow tensor $\mathcal{F}{ijk}$ captures three-way interactions:
$\mathcal{F}{ijk} = \sum_{t=1}^T \log\left(\frac{p_{ijk}(t)}{p_i(t)p_j(t)p_k(t)}\right)$
where $p_{ijk}(t)$ represents


2. We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete
dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are
bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when
the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is
significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.
Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller
than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term
decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough
scatterers is 

solution : quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical
simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number
of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.



3. Escherichia coli is a motile bacterium that moves up a chemoattractant
gradient by performing a biased random walk composed of alternating runs and
tumbles. Previous models of run and tumble chemotaxis neglect one or more
features of the motion, namely (i) a cell cannot directly detect a
chemoattractant gradient but rather makes temporal comparisons of
chemoattractant concentration, (ii) rather than being entirely random, tumbles
exhibit persistence of direction, meaning that the new direction after a tumble
is more likely to be in the forward hemisphere, and (iii) rotational Brownian
motion makes it impossible for an E. coli cell to swim in a straight line
during a run. This paper presents an analytic calculation of the chemotactic
drift velocity taking account of (i), (ii) and (iii), for weak chemotaxis. The
analytic results are verified by Monte Carlo simulation. The results reveal a


solution : synergy between temporal comparisons and persistence that enhances the drift
velocity, while rotational Brownian motion reduces the drift velocity.
