## 6.4.8 Binary Search

Binary Search makes use of the fact that if the sequence is sorted, all of the elements of interest can be found near the middle of the list.

Example :
```python
def binarySearch(arr, val):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if arr[mid] == val:

### Recursion
- What is recursion?
- Can you give me examples of recursion in math or science?
- Give me an example of a recursive algorithm.
- What is the difference between recursion and iteration?
- When would you use recursion instead of iteration?
- Recursion is when you call the function from within itself. Iteration is when you call the function and it executes the instructions.

Why is my recursion stack overflowing?
```python
def fib(n):
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

When `n` is small, `fib` is called recursively many times to
produce the fibonacci sequence. Each recursive call increases the
size of the recursion stack. As `n` gets bigger, the recursion stack
overflows. When the recursion stack overflows, the program crashes.

How can we fix this?

```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    return fib(n-

## Recursion and Time Complexity

`Time Complexity` refers to the number of operations done by an algorithm in a given amount of time (typically seconds)

`Space Complexity` refers to the amount of memory/storage space used by an algorithm

## Examples

|    | Complexity |
| --- | --------- |
| Fibonacci | `O(n)` |
| Sorting | `O(n log n)`
