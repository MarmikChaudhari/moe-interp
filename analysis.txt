3. Getting undefined in this reduce:
```javascript
const sum = arr.reduce((a,b) => a+b)
console.log(sum([1,2,3]))
```

## Solution

```javascript
const sum = arr.reduce((a,b) => a+b)
console.log(sum([1,2,3]))
```

## Explanation

The reduce method takes a function as an argument and applies it to the first two elements of the array, then to the result of the first call and the second element, and so on.

The function passed to reduce is called with three arguments: the accumulator, the current element, and the array.

The accumulator is the value that is returned from the previous call to the function.

The current element is the value of the current array element.

The array is the array that

6. MySQL query is slow with WHERE clause on a varchar column. 
What indexing strategies should I consider?

What are the downsides of having many indexes on a table?

I am trying to create a table to store the number of occurrences of a word in a string.


MySQL query is slow with WHERE clause on a varchar column. 

You need to add some indexes. You should add an index on the column itself.

You should also add an index on the column combined with the column you are using to filter:

CREATE INDEX index_name_on_column_used_in_filter ON table_name (column_used_in_filter, column_used_in_filter_other)

What are the downsides of having many indexes on a table?

Each additional index slows down inserts,

\title{Quantum Error Mitigation in NISQ Devices}
\begin{abstract}
We present a novel approach to error mitigation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. 
Our method introduces a scaling framework for quantum channels that preserves gate fidelity while reducing environmental noise.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Recent advances in NISQ devices have demonstrated both promise and limitations in quantum computation. 
The primary challenge remains decoherence, which introduces errors in quantum operations. We propose a channel scaling approach 
$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = e^{-\lambda t}\rho$ 
that provides a systematic way to
reduce environment-induced errors in NISQ devices.
This scaling approach is a natural extension of the classical scaling approach $\mathcal{N}(\rho) = \rho + \lambda \Delta \rho$,
where $\Delta \rho = \frac{\rho}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{tr}(\rho)\mathbb{I}$ is the depolarizing noise operator, and $\lambda$ is a scaling parameter.
The classical scaling approach is widely used for noise mitigation in classical computers~\cite{trefethen1997numerical}, and recent studies have demonstrated that it can be applied to quantum devices~\cite{zhu2019mitigating,wang2020dealing,jones2021noise}.

Our scaling approach is motivated


2. \title{On Graph Persistence in Dynamic Networks}
\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces a new metric for measuring structural stability in weighted directed graphs under perturbations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Preliminaries}
Consider a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with weight function $w:E	o\mathbb{R}^+$. 
The persistence measure $\mathcal{P}(G)$ quantifies stability under edge removals through:
$\mathcal{P}(G) = \sum_{i,j} w_{ij}\log(d_{ij})$
where $d_{ij}$ represents
the number of paths of length $i$ and $j$ in $G$, and $w_{ij}$ represents the weight of the edge between
$i$ and $j$.

We use $\mathcal{O}(G)$ to denote the set of all permutations of $V$.
Given two permutations $\pi_1, \pi_2 \in \mathcal{O}(V)$, $\pi_1 \prec \pi_2$ if and only if 
$\pi_1(i) < \pi_2(i)$ for all $i \in V$.

Let $\mathcal{O}(G) \times \mathcal{O}(V)$ denote the set of all pairs of permutations of $V$ and $G


3. \title{Convergence Properties of Gradient-Free Neural Architecture Search}
\begin{abstract}
We analyze the theoretical foundations of gradient-free neural architecture search (NAS) in deep learning.
\end{abstract}
\section{Problem Setup}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the space of all possible architectures. 
For each $a\in\mathcal{A}$, we define the performance measure $\mathcal{L}(a)$ as:
$\mathcal{L}(a) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D}}[\ell(f_a(x), y)]$
where $f_a$ represents
a neural network with architecture $a$ and parameter $\theta_a$,
and $\ell$ is the loss function.
Given a dataset $\mathcal{D}$, we minimize the expected loss $\mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D}}[\ell(f_a(x), y)]$ over all possible architectures.

\subsection{Gradient-Free NAS}
We consider the gradient-free NAS setting, where we do not have access to gradient information. 
We note that in the gradient-free setting, the architecture search process is often performed using an evolutionary algorithm such as \cite{real2019regularized, pham2018efficient, zoph2018learning}, which can be computationally demanding.
To address this issue, we


4. \title{Phase Transitions in Non-Equilibrium Statistical Systems}
\begin{abstract}
We identify novel scaling behavior in far-from-equilibrium statistical systems with long-range interactions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Main Results}
Consider an ensemble of $N$ interacting particles described by coordinates $\{\sigma_i\}_{i=1}^N$. 
The system's partition function $Z_N(\beta)$ demonstrates anomalous behavior:
$Z_N(\beta) = \exp(-\beta N^{1+\alpha} + o(N))$
where the exponent
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\log(1-\lambda)}{\log(1-2\lambda)}
\end{equation}
can be negative, as in the case of a spin system.
In this case, the partition function has two branches, depending on the sign of $\alpha$.
The first branch, $Z_N^+(\beta)$, is analytic in $\beta$.
The second branch, $Z_N^-(\beta)$, is discontinuous in $\beta$ and has a jump discontinuity at $\beta=0$.
The discontinuity is of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, as in the case of a spin system.

The partition function is a function of


5. \title{Adaptive Control in Robotic Systems with Unknown Dynamics}
\begin{abstract}
We present a novel hybrid impedance control framework for robotic systems operating under uncertain conditions.
\end{abstract}
\section{Controller Design}
The proposed control law $u(t)$ combines position feedback with adaptive compensation:
$u(t) = K_p(x_d - x) + B_v\dot{x} + f_{comp}(x,\dot{x})$
Here, the compensation term $f_{comp}$ is structured to
enable adaptive control for the unknown dynamics:
\begin{equation}
f_{comp}(x,\dot{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i \dot{x}_i \frac{x_i - x_d}{\tau_i} + \sum_{j=1}^m \beta_j \left( x_j - x_d \right) \dot{x}_j
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_i$ and $\beta_j$ are adaptive gains.  The adaptive terms $\gamma_i$ and $\beta_j$ are
selected to ensure that the compensation term $f_{comp}$ is a continuous function of the control input $u$.
We

6. \title{Stochastic Gene Expression in Cellular Networks}
\begin{abstract}
We develop a mathematical framework for analyzing noise-induced transitions in genetic regulatory networks at single-cell resolution.
\end{abstract}
\section{Model Development}
The state of each gene $i$ in the network is described by concentration $x_i(t)$ evolving according to:
$\frac{dx_i}{dt} = \alpha_i H(x_j) - \beta_i x_i + \eta_i(t)$
where $H(x)$ is the Hill function and $\eta_i(t)$ 
represents molecular noise with
standard deviation $\sigma_i(t)$ and correlation time $\tau_i$.
The parameters $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$
describe gene-specific parameters, 
and $\alpha_i$ can be interpreted as the strength of the transcriptional 
regulation and $\beta_i$ as the strength of the protein-protein interaction.
The noise term $\eta_i(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise 
whose correlation function (correlation time $\tau_i$) is given by:
\begin{equation}
\langle \eta_i(t) \eta_i(t') \rangle = \sigma_i^2 \delta(t-t')
\end{equation}
The Hill function

7. \title{Topological Properties of Infinite-Dimensional Banach Spaces}
\begin{abstract}
We investigate a novel characterization of weak compactness in certain classes of Banach spaces through local geometric properties.
\end{abstract}

\section{Definitions and Setup}
Let $X$ be a Banach space and $B_X$ its unit ball. We define the local geometric parameter $\gamma(X)$ as:
$\gamma(X) = \sup_{x \in B_X} \inf_{Y \subset X} \text{dist}(x, \overline{\text{conv}}(Y))$
where the supremum is taken over
all closed subspaces $Y \subset X$ of $X$ and $\text{dist}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the distance function in $X$.

A space $X$ is said to be \emph{weakly compact} if it has a weakly compact unit ball and $\gamma(X) = 1$.
A space $X$ is said to be \emph{strongly compact} if it has a strong compact unit ball and $\gamma(X) = 1$.

\begin{theorem}\cite{Cichocki}
Let $X$ be a Banach space. If $X$ is weakly compact, then $X$ is strongly compact.

8. \title{Information Flow in Complex Ecological Networks}
\begin{abstract}
We present an entropy-based framework for quantifying resilience in food webs and mutualistic networks.
\end{abstract}
\section{Network Analysis}
Consider an ecological network with $n$ species. The information flow tensor $\mathcal{F}{ijk}$ captures three-way interactions:
ight)$cal{F}{ijk} = \sum_{t=1}^T \log\left(\frac{p_{ijk}(t)}{p_i(t)p_j(t)p_k(t)}
where $p_{ijk}(t)$ represents
the probability that species $i$ is involved in a $j$-$k$ interaction at time step $t$, and
$p_i(t)$ and $p_j(t)$ represent the probability that species $i$ and $j$ are involved in an interaction, respectively.
We calculate $\mathcal{F}{ijk}$ for a range of time steps $T$ and average over the ensemble.
We assume that the probability of a species being involved in an interaction is proportional to its abundance, and therefore use abundance rather than probability in the calculation of $\mathcal{F}{ijk}$.
For each species $i$, we define the abundance-weighted information flow tensor $\mathcal{F}_i{ijk}$ as
$\mathcal{F}_i


9. \title{Geometric Flows on Manifolds with Boundary}
\begin{abstract}
We study the behavior of mean curvature flow on compact manifolds with non-smooth boundaries.
\end{abstract}

\section{Preliminary Results}
Let $(M^n, g)$ be a Riemannian manifold with boundary $\partial M$. The flow is given by:
$\frac{\partial X}{\partial t} = H(X)\nu + \lambda(X)\tau$
where $H$ is the mean curvature, $\nu$ is the normal vector, and
$\lambda$ is the Lagrangian variable, which is assumed to be positive,
so that the flow is well posed.
We assume that either $\partial M$ is smooth, or that it is a smooth
boundary of another compact manifold $M'$ without boundary.
If $\partial M$ is smooth, then we can assume that $M'$ is a
compact manifold with boundary $\partial M'$.
If $\partial M$ is a smooth boundary, then
$M'$ can be obtained as the interior of a compact manifold $M''$
with boundary $\partial M''$ (see Figure \ref{fig:boundary}).

10. \title{Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics of Climate Systems}
\begin{abstract}
We develop a statistical mechanical approach to understanding extreme events in atmospheric dynamics.
\end{abstract}

\section{Model Construction}
The probability distribution of atmospheric states evolves according to:
$rac{\partial P}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot (FP) + D\nabla^2P + \sum_i \lambda_i \mathcal{O}_i P$
where $F$ represents the deterministic forcing and
$P$ represents the probability distribution of the system (see Section \ref{sec:statmech}).
The linear term $D \nabla^2 P $ represents the effects of diffusion.
The linear term $\sum_i \lambda_i \mathcal{O}_i P$ represents the effect of linear forcing.
The term $ \mathcal{O}_i P$ represents the nonlinear effects of the $i^{th}$ forcing term.
The nonlinear term $\mathcal{O}_i P$ includes the effects of both positive and negative feedbacks.
For example, the nonlinear term $\mathcal{O}_i P$ could include the effects of positive feedbacks such as ice-albedo feedback and snow-albedo feedback.

1. In the dim parlor of Blackwood Manor, Sarah traced her fingers across the leather-bound volumes, 
each bearing the same curious inscription : 
"For those who remember the winter of 1856." What puzzled her more than the matching dates was how every book, 
regardless of its apparent age, carried the faint scent of fresh ink and
how the letters in the titles were all written in the same flowing script. 
A slight tapping sound interrupted her reading. She glanced up to see a small figure wrapped in a 
velvet blanket, sitting on the hearth. 
"Who are you?" Sarah asked. "What are you doing here?" 
"I'm here to see you," the tiny man said. His voice was as high and sweet as a silver bell. "I've been 
waiting for you." 
"Who are you?" Sarah asked again. 
"I'm the ghost of Christmas Past," he said, laughing merrily. "I'll take you back to the night when you

2. The last letter from Ernest arrived on a Tuesday, just as Marion had predicted. 
Inside the envelope was not his familiar cursive, but a single photograph of the lighthouse where they first met. 
On its reverse, three words were stamped in fading typescript: "Time moves differently..."   
It was the last thing Marion read before she fell asleep. 
The next morning, she awoke to find that the photograph was gone. 


The Lighthouse

The lighthouse loomed in the distance. 

It had been a long time since Marion had seen it, but she remembered it well. The lighthouse was a fixture of her dreams, a beacon of her subconscious. It was a constant reminder of her past, an emblem of her present, and a symbol of her future. 

Marion was walking toward it now. She could see it in the distance, a small dot on the horizon. It was a long way away, but she was determined to get there. 

The lighthouse was a symbol of her past


3. The bookshop on Cedar Street had a peculiar policy: customers could only enter on rainy days, 
and no one was allowed to purchase the books displayed in the front window. 
Mrs. Whitaker, who had owned the shop for forty years, 
would simply smile when asked about these rules and say the books themselves insisted upon them. 
It wasn't until the endless summer drought of 2024 that anyone understood why the rain was so essential to   
the shop's inventory.
The bookshop was a tiny, cramped collection of books arranged on shelves that were crammed against the walls. 
The shelves were so close together that it was impossible to walk between them. 
In the center of the shop were two large, round tables that were always piled high with books. 
The tables were surrounded by chairs that were also stacked with books. 
It was impossible to walk between the tables, and the chairs were so close together it was impossible to sit down. 
In the back of the shop was a large room that had once been a kitchen. 
The room had a cast-iron stove, a cast-iron sink, and a cast-iron table. 
The table was


4. Upon the moors of Thornfield Hall, in that bitter winter of 17--, 
there came a peculiar circumstance which no member of the household could readily explain. 
The master's portraitâhung these fifty years in the great hallâhad begun to alter its countenance by candlelight, 
and the servants whispered that on nights when the north wind howled across the heath, 
the painted eyes would
light up, and seem to follow the movements of the household round the room. 
Then the master would look down on the servants with a stony stare, 
as if he had an interest in their movements which they did not understand. 
And the master, the master, was a strange master, 
and the master's lady was a strange lady; 
and I, for my part, could not understand them, and was glad to hear that the master's portrait had begun to look at them. 
As for the master and the lady, they seemed to understand one another very well. 
And the master, the master, was a strange master, and the lady was a strange lady. 
And I, for my part


5. Being a True and Faithful Account of the Curious Happenings at Blackbriar Abbey
Anno Domini 1783
Chapter the First
Wherein is related how Miss Eleanor Blackwood, having inherited her uncle's vast library of forbidden texts, 
came upon a volume bound in peculiar leather, its pages unmarked save for a single sentence, repeated thus: 
"When the bells of St. Martin's toll thirteen times at midnight, she who reads these words shall
be forever lost. But should she survive, her soul shall be restored to her body."

At length, in the quiet of the night, she did open the book, and did read the words that were written therein. 
And the bells of St. Martin's tolled thirteen times, and she who read the words was forever lost. 
But at the twelfth tolling, her soul was restored to her body.

The bells of St. Martin's tolled thirteen times at midnight, and she who read the words did survive. 
She heard a voice from the shadows, and it spoke to her:

"You have heard the words, and you have survived. Now, you shall be forever lost."

6. Every morning, the AI therapy bot asked Dylan the same question: "What do you remember about yesterday?" 
Every morning, Dylan's answer was different, though he was describing the same day. 
The bot's developers said this was impossibleâtheir memory tracking system was infallible. 
But on day 47, the bot itself started giving different answers about what Dylan had said, 
and that's when the glitch in reality began 
          
Dylan was taken to a mental institution, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
He spent the next ten years there, where he was subjected to electroconvulsive therapy and other treatments. 
At the end of his time there, Dylan was given a battery of tests to assess his mental health. 
He was given the same battery of tests every three months. 
After three years, he was given the battery of tests for the last time. 
He was given the battery of tests for the last time.

7. The last physical bookstore in the city didn't stock actual booksâjust QR codes you could scan to download them. 
But in the back corner, behind a shelf of defunct e-readers, Claire found a real paper book. Its pages were blank until you bled on them, 
and each reader saw a different story. 
The owner said it had been returned seventeen times, each person insisting that what they read inside couldn't be true. 
But when Claire took it home and tested it with a drop of blood, 
the words that appeared were not a story but 
          
a prophecy: 
You will be the one to find the missing link. 
You will be the one to end the war. 
You will be the one to set the world right again. 
You will be the one to restore the balance. 
You will be the one to save us all. 
          
The next day, Claire found a note on her doorstep. 
It read:

8. From the Private Journal of Rev. James Alderton
September 15th, 1789
It has become apparent that the ancient yew tree in the churchyard, 
beneath which lie the graves of the -- family these three centuries past, bears fruit in direct violation of its nature. 
The berries, black as pitch and appearing only at midnight, seem to whisper secrets of
the grave to the night air, and the trees seem to take a perverse joy in 
spreading their secrets to all who pass by. 
I have heard the trees whisper to one another in the night, and their whispers 
seem to be more than mere wind in the branches. 
They appear to be talking of the -- family, and of the grave, and of the 
curse that lies upon it. 
I must be careful. 
Those who hear these whispers may not understand them, and they may 
draw the wrong conclusion. 
I must be careful. 
I am a man of God, and I must not be led astray. 
I must not let myself be tempted by the

1. When twilight draws her velvet curtain nigh,
And stars like scattered diamonds pierce the sky,
The nightingale, whose song did oft take wing,
Now perches silent, remembering
How once in gardens fair and bright
                   
He sang his lays and gave delight;
But now, alas! his woes are told
To some fond listener in the cold.

Now, in the night, in that calm region
Where nought disturbs the silent ocean,
The sailor, in his boat, alone
               
Sleeps, while the moon above him shone,
And all is silent, still, and dark,
While, like a watchman, his soul doth mark
The passing of the passing hours,
And by that motion knows the hours.

The sailor, in his dreamy state,
Sees on the watery ocean's seat
A phantom ship, with sails unfurled,
And sails in the dark, and sails


2. In marble halls where ancient shadows dwell,
Where kings and queens their solemn vigils keep,
The crown that bore a kingdom's hopes did tell
Of secrets locked in chambers dark and deep.
Upon its golden rim, inscribed in light
                   
A single word, inscribed in letters black,
The word that is the doom of kings and knights,
The word that spells the doom of all men,
That word is...

That shows not mere reflection's common grace,
But depths where shadows dance and secrets lie,
Where truth and seeming truth do gently vie?
For when she gazes deep into thy sheen,
The lady glimpses what was never               

What secrets does the lady's glance conceal,

As her eyes search the depths of thy silver sheen,
And her face shows not reflection's common grace,
But depths where shadows dance and secrets lie,
Where truth and seeming truth do gently vie?
For when she gazes deep into thy silver sheen,
The lady glimpses what was never seen.
