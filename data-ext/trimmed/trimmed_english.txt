In Which We Begin Not to Understand\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It is not without a certain emotion that I begin to recount here the\r\n\r\n      extraordinary adventures of Joseph Rouletabille. Down to the present time\r\n\r\n      he had so firmly opposed my doing it that I had come to despair of ever\r\n\r\n      publishing the most curious of police stories of the past fifteen years. I\r\n\r\n      had even imagined that the public would never know the whole truth of the\r\n\r\n      prodigious case known as that of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, out of which grew so\r\n\r\n      many mysterious, cruel, and sensational dramas, with which my friend was\r\n\r\n      so closely mixed up, if, propos of a recent nomination of the illustrious\r\n\r\n      Stangerson to the grade of grandcross of the Legion of Honour, an evening\r\n\r\n      journal\u2014in an article, miserable for its ignorance, or audacious for\r\n\r\n      its perfidy\u2014had not resuscitated a terrible adventure of which\r\n\r\n      Joseph Rouletabille had told me he wished to be for ever forgotten.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d! Who now remembers this affair which caused so much ink to\r\n\r\n      flow fifteen years ago? Events are so quickly forgotten in Paris. Has not\r\n\r\n      the very name of the Nayves trial and the tragic history of the death of\r\n\r\n      little Menaldo passed out of mind? And yet the public attention was so\r\n\r\n      deeply interested in the details of the trial that the occurrence of a\r\n\r\n      ministerial crisis was completely unnoticed at the time. Now The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room trial, which, preceded that of the Nayves by some years, made far\r\n\r\n      more noise. The entire world hung for months over this obscure problem\u2014the\r\n\r\n      most obscure, it seems to me, that has ever challenged the perspicacity of\r\n\r\n      our police or taxed the conscience of our judges. The solution of the\r\n\r\n      problem baffled everybody who tried to find it. It was like a dramatic\r\n\r\n      rebus with which old Europe and new America alike became fascinated. That\r\n\r\n      is, in truth\u2014I am permitted to say, because there cannot be any\r\n\r\n      author\u2019s vanity in all this, since I do nothing more than transcribe facts\r\n\r\n      on which an exceptional documentation enables me to throw a new light\u2014that\r\n\r\n      is because, in truth, I do not know that, in the domain of reality or\r\n\r\n      imagination, one can discover or recall to mind anything comparable, in\r\n\r\n      its mystery, with the natural mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      That which nobody could find out, Joseph Rouletabille, aged eighteen, then\r\n\r\n      a reporter engaged on a leading journal, succeeded in discovering. But\r\n\r\n      when, at the Assize Court, he brought in the key to the whole case, he did\r\n\
