<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Intersection Bodies and Generalized Cosine Transforms Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking   Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call $\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of $L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some known facts and give them new proofs. 
Excision for K-theory of connective ring spectra We extend Geisser and Hesselholt's result on ``bi-relative K-theory'' from discrete rings to connective ring spectra. That is, if $\mathcal A$ is a homotopy cartesian $n$-cube of ring spectra (satisfying connectivity hypotheses), then the $(n+1)$-cube induced by the cyclotomic trace $$K(\mathcal A)\to TC(\mathcal A)$$ is homotopy cartesian after profinite completion. In other words, the fiber of the profinitely completed cyclotomic trace satisfies excision. 
Local spin dynamic arising from the non-perturbative SU(2) gauge field   of the spin orbit effect We use the non-perturbative gauge field approach to study the effects of spin orbit coupling on the dynamic of magnetic moment. We present a general equation of motion (EOM) which unifies i) the spin orbit coupling effect derived from the SU(2) spin gauge field, and ii) the moment chirality effect previously derived from the topological U(1)xU(1) rotation gauge under the adiabatic condition. We present a modified Landau-Liftshitz-Gilbert equation and discuss the implication of the modified EOM in various technological applications, such as current-induced switching and trajectory of magnetic moments in spin-valve multilayers, magnetic memory and diluted magnetic semiconductor. 
Measurement of the p\bar{p}\to WZ + X cross section at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV   and limits on WWZ trilinear gauge couplings We present measurements of the process $p\bar{p} \to WZ+X \to \ell^{\prime} \nu_{\ell^{\prime}} \ell \bar{\ell}$ at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV, where $\ell$ and $\ell^{\prime}$ are electrons or muons. Using 1 fb$^{-1}$ of data from the D0 experiment, we observe 13 candidates with an expected background of $4.5\pm0.6$ events and measure a cross section $\sigma(WZ)=2.7^{+1.7}_{-1.3}$ pb. From the number of observed events and the $Z$ boson transverse momentum distribution, we limit the trilinear $WWZ$ gauge couplings to $-0.17 \le \lambda_Z \le 0.21$ $(\Delta \kappa_Z = 0)$ at the 95% C.L. for a form factor scale $\Lambda=2$ TeV. Further, assuming that $\Delta g^Z_1 = \Delta\kappa_Z$, we find $-0.12 \le \Delta\kappa_Z \le 0.29$ $(\lambda_Z=0)$ at the 95% C.L. These are the most restrictive limits on the $WWZ$ couplings available to date. 
Radiation Hydrodynamics in Kerr Spacetime: Equations without Coordinate   Singularity at the Event Horizon Equations of fully general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics around a rotating black hole are derived by using the Kerr-Schild coordinate where there is no coordinate singularity at the event horizon. Since the radiation interacts with matter moving with relativistic velocities near the event horizon, the interplay between the radiation and the matter should be described fully relativistically. In the formalism used in this study, while the interactions between matter and radiation are introduced in the comoving frame, the equations and the equations and the derivatives for the description of the global evolution of both matter and the radiation are given in the Kerr-Schild frame (KSF) which is a frame fixed to the coordinate describing the central black hole. As a frame fixed to the coordinate, we use the locally non-rotating reference frame (LNRF) representing a radially falling frame when the Kerr-Schild coordinate is used. Around the rotating black hole, both the matter and the radiation are affected by the frame-dragging effects. 
Width of Radio-Loud and Radio-Quiet CMEs In the present paper we report on the difference in angular sizes between radio-loud and radio-quiet CMEs. For this purpose we compiled these two samples of events using Wind/WAVES and SOHO/LASCO observations obtained during 1996-2005. It is shown that the radio-loud CMEs are almost two times wider than the radio-quiet CMEs (considering expanding parts of CMEs). Furthermore we show that the radio-quiet CMEs have a narrow expanding bright part with a large extended diffusive structure. These results were obtained by measuring the CME widths in three different ways. 
Test of CZT Detectors with Different Pixel Pitches and Thicknesses The Modified Horizontal Bridgman (MHB) process produces Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) crystals with high yield and excellent homogeneity. Various groups,including our own, previously reported on the test of 2x2x0.5 cm3 MHB CZT detectors grown by the company Orbotech and read out with 8x8 pixels. In this contribution, we describe the optimization of the photolithographic process used for contacting the CZT detector with pixel contacts. The optimized process gives a high yield of good pixels down to pixel diameters/pitches of 50 microns. Furthermore, we discuss the performance of 0.5 cm and 0.75 cm thick detectors contacted with 64 and 225 pixel read out with the RENA-3 ASICs from the company NOVA R&D. 
Quantum Circuits Architecture We present a method for optimizing quantum circuits architecture. The method is based on the notion of "quantum comb", which describes a circuit board in which one can insert variable subcircuits. The method allows one to efficiently address novel kinds of quantum information processing tasks, such as storing-retrieving, and cloning of channels. 
A Method for Deriving Transverse Masses Using Lagrange Multipliers We use Lagrange multipliers to extend the traditional definition of Transverse Mass used in experimental high energy physics. We demonstrate the method by implementing it to derive a new Transverse Mass that can be used as a discriminator to distinguish between top decays via a charged W or a charged Higgs Boson. 
Superfluid pairing between fermions with unequal masses We consider a superfluid state in a two-component gas of fermionic atoms with equal densities and unequal masses in the BCS limit. We develop a perturbation theory along the lines proposed by Gorkov and Melik-Barkhudarov and find that for a large difference in the masses of heavy ($M$) and light ($m$) atoms one has to take into account both the second-order and third-order contributions. The result for the critical temperature and order parameter is then quite different from the prediction of the simple BCS approach. Moreover, the small parameter of the theory turns out to be $(p_{F}|a|)/\hbar)\sqrt{M/m}\ll1$, where $p_{F}$ is the Fermi momentum, and $a$ the scattering length. Thus, for a large mass ratio $M/m$ the conventional perturbation theory requires significantly smaller Fermi momenta (densities) or scattering lengths than in the case of $M\sim m$, where the small parameter is $(p_{F}|a|)/\hbar)\ll1$. We show that 3-body scattering resonances appearing at a large mass ratio due to the presence of 3-body bound Efimov states do not influence the result, which in this sense becomes universal. 
Opportunistic Scheduling and Beamforming for MIMO-OFDMA Downlink Systems   with Reduced Feedback Opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes with reduced feedback are proposed for MIMO-OFDMA downlink systems. Unlike the conventional beamforming schemes in which beamforming is implemented solely by the base station (BS) in a per-subcarrier fashion, the proposed schemes take advantages of a novel channel decomposition technique to perform beamforming jointly by the BS and the mobile terminal (MT). The resulting beamforming schemes allow the BS to employ only {\em one} beamforming matrix (BFM) to form beams for {\em all} subcarriers while each MT completes the beamforming task for each subcarrier locally. Consequently, for a MIMO-OFDMA system with $Q$ subcarriers, the proposed opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes require only one BFM index and $Q$ supportable throughputs to be returned from each MT to the BS, in contrast to $Q$ BFM indices and $Q$ supportable throughputs required by the conventional schemes. The advantage of the proposed schemes becomes more evident when a further feedback reduction is achieved by grouping adjacent subcarriers into exclusive clusters and returning only cluster information from each MT. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed reduced-feedback schemes.
