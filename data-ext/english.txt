HONORINE\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      By Honore De Balzac\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Translated by Clara Bell\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      DEDICATION To Monsieur Achille Deveria An affectionate\r\n\r\n      remembrance from the Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n HONORINE   ADDENDUM \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      HONORINE\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      If the French have as great an aversion for traveling as the English have\r\n\r\n      a propensity for it, both English and French have perhaps sufficient\r\n\r\n      reasons. Something better than England is everywhere to be found; whereas\r\n\r\n      it is excessively difficult to find the charms of France outside France.\r\n\r\n      Other countries can show admirable scenery, and they frequently offer\r\n\r\n      greater comfort than that of France, which makes but slow progress in that\r\n\r\n      particular. They sometimes display a bewildering magnificence, grandeur,\r\n\r\n      and luxury; they lack neither grace nor noble manners; but the life of the\r\n\r\n      brain, the talent for conversation, the \u201cAttic salt\u201d so familiar at Paris,\r\n\r\n      the prompt apprehension of what one is thinking, but does not say, the\r\n\r\n      spirit of the unspoken, which is half the French language, is nowhere else\r\n\r\n      to be met with. Hence a Frenchman, whose raillery, as it is, finds so\r\n\r\n      little comprehension, would wither in a foreign land like an uprooted\r\n\r\n      tree. Emigration is counter to the instincts of the French nation. Many\r\n\r\n      Frenchmen, of the kind here in question, have owned to pleasure at seeing\r\n\r\n      the custom-house officers of their native land, which may seem the most\r\n\r\n      daring hyperbole of patriotism.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This preamble is intended to recall to such Frenchmen as have traveled the\r\n\r\n      extreme pleasure they have felt on occasionally finding their native land,\r\n\r\n      like an oasis, in the drawing-room of some diplomate: a pleasure hard to\r\n\r\n      be understood by those who have never left the asphalt of the Boulevard\r\n\r\n      des Italiens, and to whom the Quais of the left bank of the Seine are not\r\n\r\n      really Paris. To find Paris again! Do you know what that means, O\r\n\r\n      Parisians? It is to find\u2014not indeed the cookery of the Rocher de\r\n\r\n      Cancale as Borel elaborates it for those who can appreciate it, for\r\n\r\n      that exists only in the Rue Montorgueil\u2014but a meal which reminds you\r\n\r\n      of it! It is to find the wines of France, which out of France are to be\r\n\r\n      regarded as myths, and as rare as the woman of whom I write! It is to find\u2014not\r\n\r\n      the most fashionable pleasantry, for it loses its aroma between Paris and\r\n\r\n      the frontier\u2014but the witty understanding, the critical atmosphere in\r\n\r\n      which the French live, from the poet down to the artisan, from the duchess\r\n\r\n      to the boy in the street.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      In 1836, when the Sardinian Court was residing at Genoa, two Parisians,\r\n\r\n      more or less famous, could fancy themselves still in Paris when they found\r\n\r\n      themselves in a palazzo, taken by the French Consul-General, on the hill\r\n\r\n      forming the last fold of the Apennines between the gate of San Tomaso and\r\n\r\n      the well-known lighthouse, which is to be seen in all the keepsake views\r\n\r\n      of Genoa. This palazzo is one of the magnificent villas on which Genoese\r\n\r\n      nobles were wont to spend millions at the time when the aristocratic\r\n\r\n      republic was a power.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      If the early night is beautiful anywhere, it surely is at Genoa, after it\r\n\r\n      has rained as it can rain there, in torrents, all the morning; when the\r\n\r\n      clearness of the sea vies with that of the sky; when silence reigns on the\r\n\r\n      quay and in the groves of the villa, and over the marble heads with\r\n\r\n      yawning jaws, from which water mysteriously flows; when the stars are\r\n\r\n      beaming; when the waves of the Mediterranean lap one after another like\r\n\r\n      the avowal of a woman, from whom you drag it word by word. It must be\r\n\r\n      confessed, that the moment when the perfumed air brings fragrance to the\r\n\r\n      lungs and to our day-dreams; when voluptuousness, made visible and ambient\r\n\r\n      as the air, holds you in your easy-chair; when, a spoon in your hand, you\r\n\r\n      sip an ice or a sorbet, the town at your feet and fair woman opposite\u2014such\r\n\r\n      Boccaccio hours can be known only in Italy and on the shores of the\r\n\r\n      Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Imagine to yourself, round the table, the Marquis di Negro, a knight\r\n\r\n      hospitaller to all men of talent on their travels, and the Marquis Damaso\r\n\r\n      Pareto, two Frenchmen disguised as Genoese, a Consul-General with a wife\r\n\r\n      as beautiful as a Madonna, and two silent children\u2014silent because\r\n\r\n      sleep has fallen on them\u2014the French Ambassador and his wife, a\r\n\r\n      secretary to the Embassy who believes himself to be crushed and\r\n\r\n      mischievous; finally, two Parisians, who have come to take leave of the\r\n\r\n      Consul\u2019s wife at a splendid dinner, and you will have the picture\r\n\r\n      presented by the terrace of the villa about the middle of May\u2014a\r\n\r\n      picture in which the predominant figure was that of a celebrated woman, on\r\n\r\n      whom all eyes centered now and again, the heroine of this improvised\r\n\r\n      festival.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      One of the two Frenchmen was the famous landscape painter, Leon de Lora;\r\n\r\n      the other a well known critic Claude Vignon. They had both come with this\r\n\r\n      lady, one of the glories of the fair sex, Mademoiselle des Touches, known\r\n\r\n      in the literary world by the name of Camille Maupin.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle des Touches had been to Florence on business. With the\r\n\r\n      charming kindness of which she is prodigal, she had brought with her Leon\r\n\r\n      de Lora to show him Italy, and had gone on as far as Rome that he might\r\n\r\n      see the Campagna. She had come by Simplon, and was returning by the\r\n\r\n      Cornice road to Marseilles. She had stopped at Genoa, again on the\r\n\r\n      landscape painter\u2019s account. The Consul-General had, of course, wished to\r\n\r\n      do the honors of Genoa, before the arrival of the Court, to a woman whose\r\n\r\n      wealth, name, and position recommend her no less than her talents. Camille\r\n\r\n      Maupin, who knew her Genoa down to its smallest chapels, had left her\r\n\r\n      landscape painter to the care of the diplomate and the two Genoese\r\n\r\n      marquises, and was miserly of her minutes. Though the ambassador was a\r\n\r\n      distinguished man of letters, the celebrated lady had refused to yield to\r\n\r\n      his advances, dreading what the English call an exhibition; but she had\r\n\r\n      drawn in the claws of her refusals when it was proposed that they should\r\n\r\n      spend a farewell day at the Consul\u2019s villa. Leon de Lora had told Camille\r\n\r\n      that her presence at the villa was the only return he could make to the\r\n\r\n      Ambassador and his wife, the two Genoese noblemen, the Consul and his\r\n\r\n      wife. So Mademoiselle des Touches had sacrificed one of those days of\r\n\r\n      perfect freedom, which are not always to be had in Paris by those on whom\r\n\r\n      the world has its eye.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Now, the meeting being accounted for, it is easy to understand that\r\n\r\n      etiquette had been banished, as well as a great many women even of the\r\n\r\n      highest rank, who were curious to know whether Camille Maupin\u2019s manly\r\n\r\n      talent impaired her grace as a pretty woman, and to see, in a word,\r\n\r\n      whether the trousers showed below her petticoats. After dinner till nine\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock, when a collation was served, though the conversation had been gay\r\n\r\n      and grave by turns, and constantly enlivened by Leon de Lora\u2019s sallies\u2014for\r\n\r\n      he is considered the most roguish wit of Paris to-day\u2014and by the\r\n\r\n      good taste which will surprise no one after the list of guests, literature\r\n\r\n      had scarcely been mentioned. However, the butterfly flittings of this\r\n\r\n      French tilting match were certain to come to it, were it only to flutter\r\n\r\n      over this essentially French subject. But before coming to the turn in the\r\n\r\n      conversation which led the Consul-General to speak, it will not be out of\r\n\r\n      place to give some account of him and his family.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This diplomate, a man of four-and-thirty, who had been married about six\r\n\r\n      years, was the living portrait of Lord Byron. The familiarity of that face\r\n\r\n      makes a description of the Consul\u2019s unnecessary. It may, however, be noted\r\n\r\n      that there was no affectation in his dreamy expression. Lord Byron was a\r\n\r\n      poet, and the Consul was poetical; women know and recognize the\r\n\r\n      difference, which explains without justifying some of their attachments.\r\n\r\n      His handsome face, thrown into relief by a delightful nature, had\r\n\r\n      captivated a Genoese heiress. A Genoese heiress! the expression might\r\n\r\n      raise a smile at Genoa, where, in consequence of the inability of\r\n\r\n      daughters to inherit, a woman is rarely rich; but Onorina Pedrotti, the\r\n\r\n      only child of a banker without heirs male, was an exception.\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding all the flattering advances prompted by a spontaneous\r\n\r\n      passion, the Consul-General had not seemed to wish to marry. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\n      after living in the town for two years, and after certain steps taken by\r\n\r\n      the Ambassador during his visits to the Genoese Court, the marriage was\r\n\r\n      decided on. The young man withdrew his former refusal, less on account of\r\n\r\n      the touching affection of Onorina Pedrotti than by reason of an unknown\r\n\r\n      incident, one of those crises of private life which are so instantly\r\n\r\n      buried under the daily tide of interests that, at a subsequent date, the\r\n\r\n      most natural actions seem inexplicable.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This involution of causes sometimes affects the most serious events of\r\n\r\n      history. This, at any rate, was the opinion of the town of Genoa, where,\r\n\r\n      to some women, the extreme reserve, the melancholy of the French Consul\r\n\r\n      could be explained only by the word passion. It may be remarked, in\r\n\r\n      passing, that women never complain of being the victims of a preference;\r\n\r\n      they are very ready to immolate themselves for the common weal. Onorina\r\n\r\n      Pedrotti, who might have hated the Consul if she had been altogether\r\n\r\n      scorned, loved her sposo no less, and perhaps more, when she know\r\n\r\n      that he had loved. Women allow precedence in love affairs. All is well if\r\n\r\n      other women are in question.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      A man is not a diplomate with impunity: the sposo was as secret as\r\n\r\n      the grave\u2014so secret that the merchants of Genoa chose to regard the\r\n\r\n      young Consul\u2019s attitude as premeditated, and the heiress might perhaps\r\n\r\n      have slipped through his fingers if he had not played his part of a\r\n\r\n      love-sick malade imaginaire. If it was real, the women thought it\r\n\r\n      too degrading to be believed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Pedrotti\u2019s daughter gave him her love as a consolation; she lulled these\r\n\r\n      unknown griefs in a cradle of tenderness and Italian caresses.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Il Signor Pedrotti had indeed no reason to complain of the choice to which\r\n\r\n      he was driven by his beloved child. Powerful protectors in Paris watched\r\n\r\n      over the young diplomate\u2019s fortunes. In accordance with a promise made by\r\n\r\n      the Ambassador to the Consul-General\u2019s father-in-law, the young man was\r\n\r\n      created Baron and Commander of the Legion of Honor. Signor Pedrotti\r\n\r\n      himself was made a Count by the King of Sardinia. Onorina\u2019s dower was a\r\n\r\n      million of francs. As to the fortune of the Casa Pedrotti, estimated at\r\n\r\n      two millions, made in the corn trade, the young couple came into it within\r\n\r\n      six months of their marriage, for the first and last Count Pedrotti died\r\n\r\n      in January 1831.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Onorina Pedrotti is one of those beautiful Genoese women who, when they\r\n\r\n      are beautiful, are the most magnificent creatures in Italy. Michael Angelo\r\n\r\n      took his models in Genoa for the tomb of Giuliano. Hence the fulness and\r\n\r\n      singular placing of the breast in the figures of Day and Night, which so\r\n\r\n      many critics have thought exaggerated, but which is peculiar to the women\r\n\r\n      of Liguria. A Genoese beauty is no longer to be found excepting under the\r\n\r\n      mezzaro, as at Venice it is met with only under the fazzioli. This\r\n\r\n      phenomenon is observed among all fallen nations. The noble type survives\r\n\r\n      only among the populace, as after the burning of a town coins are found\r\n\r\n      hidden in the ashes. And Onorina, an exception as regards her fortune, is\r\n\r\n      no less an exceptional patrician beauty. Recall to mind the figure of\r\n\r\n      Night which Michael Angelo has placed at the feet of the Pensieroso,\r\n\r\n      dress her in modern garb, twist that long hair round the magnificent head,\r\n\r\n      a little dark in complexion, set a spark of fire in those dreamy eyes,\r\n\r\n      throw a scarf about the massive bosom, see the long dress, white,\r\n\r\n      embroidered with flowers, imagine the statue sitting upright, with her\r\n\r\n      arms folded like those of Mademoiselle Georges, and you will see before\r\n\r\n      you the Consul\u2019s wife, with a boy of six, as handsome as a mother\u2019s\r\n\r\n      desire, and a little girl of four on her knees, as beautiful as the type\r\n\r\n      of childhood so laboriously sought out by the sculptor David to grace a\r\n\r\n      tomb.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This beautiful family was the object of Camille\u2019s secret study. It struck\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle des Touches that the Consul looked rather too absent-minded\r\n\r\n      for a perfectly happy man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Although, throughout the day, the husband and wife had offered her the\r\n\r\n      pleasing spectacle of complete happiness, Camille wondered why one of the\r\n\r\n      most superior men she had ever met, and whom she had seen too in Paris\r\n\r\n      drawing-rooms, remained as Consul-General at Genoa when he possessed a\r\n\r\n      fortune of a hundred odd thousand francs a year. But, at the same time,\r\n\r\n      she had discerned, by many of the little nothings which women perceive\r\n\r\n      with the intelligence of the Arab sage in Zadig, that the husband\r\n\r\n      was faithfully devoted. These two handsome creatures would no doubt love\r\n\r\n      each other without a misunderstanding till the end of their days. So\r\n\r\n      Camille said to herself alternately, \u201cWhat is wrong?\u2014Nothing is\r\n\r\n      wrong,\u201d following the misleading symptoms of the Consul\u2019s demeanor; and\r\n\r\n      he, it may be said, had the absolute calmness of Englishmen, of savages,\r\n\r\n      of Orientals, and of consummate diplomatists.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      In discussing literature, they spoke of the perennial stock-in-trade of\r\n\r\n      the republic of letters\u2014woman\u2019s sin. And they presently found\r\n\r\n      themselves confronted by two opinions: When a woman sins, is the man or\r\n\r\n      the woman to blame? The three women present\u2014the Ambassadress, the\r\n\r\n      Consul\u2019s wife, and Mademoiselle des Touches, women, of course, of\r\n\r\n      blameless reputations\u2014were without pity for the woman. The men tried\r\n\r\n      to convince these fair flowers of their sex that some virtues might remain\r\n\r\n      in a woman after she had fallen.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow long are we going to play at hide-and-seek in this way?\u201d said Leon de\r\n\r\n      Lora.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCara vita, go and put your children to bed, and send me by Gina\r\n\r\n      the little black pocket-book that lies on my Boule cabinet,\u201d said the\r\n\r\n      Consul to his wife.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She rose without a reply, which shows that she loved her husband very\r\n\r\n      truly, for she already knew French enough to understand that her husband\r\n\r\n      was getting rid of her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will tell you a story in which I played a part, and after that we can\r\n\r\n      discuss it, for it seems to me childish to practise with the scalpel on an\r\n\r\n      imaginary body. Begin by dissecting a corpse.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Every one prepared to listen, with all the greater readiness because they\r\n\r\n      had all talked enough, and this is the moment to be chosen for telling a\r\n\r\n      story. This, then, is the Consul-General\u2019s tale:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I was two-and-twenty, and had taken my degree in law, my old uncle,\r\n\r\n      the Abbe Loraux, then seventy-two years old, felt it necessary to provide\r\n\r\n      me with a protector, and to start me in some career. This excellent man,\r\n\r\n      if not indeed a saint, regarded each year of his life as a fresh gift from\r\n\r\n      God. I need not tell you that the father confessor of a Royal Highness had\r\n\r\n      no difficulty in finding a place for a young man brought up by himself,\r\n\r\n      his sister\u2019s only child. So one day, towards the end of the year 1824,\r\n\r\n      this venerable old man, who for five years had been Cure of the White\r\n\r\n      Friars at Paris, came up to the room I had in his house, and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Get yourself dressed, my dear boy; I am going to introduce you to some\r\n\r\n      one who is willing to engage you as secretary. If I am not mistaken, he\r\n\r\n      may fill my place in the event of God\u2019s taking me to Himself. I shall have\r\n\r\n      finished mass at nine o\u2019clock; you have three-quarters of an hour before\r\n\r\n      you. Be ready.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What, uncle! must I say good-bye to this room, where for four years I\r\n\r\n      have been so happy?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I have no fortune to leave you,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Have you not the reputation of your name to leave me, the memory of your\r\n\r\n      good works\u2014\u2014?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018We need say nothing of that inheritance,\u2019 he replied, smiling. \u2018You do\r\n\r\n      not yet know enough of the world to be aware that a legacy of that kind is\r\n\r\n      hardly likely to be paid, whereas by taking you this morning to M. le\r\n\r\n      Comte\u2019\u2014Allow me,\u201d said the Consul, interrupting himself, \u201cto speak\r\n\r\n      of my protector by his Christian name only, and to call him Comte Octave.\u2014\u2018By\r\n\r\n      taking you this morning to M. le Comte Octave, I hope to secure you his\r\n\r\n      patronage, which, if you are so fortunate as to please that virtuous\r\n\r\n      statesman\u2014as I make no doubt you can\u2014will be worth, at least,\r\n\r\n      as much as the fortune I might have accumulated for you, if my\r\n\r\n      brother-in-law\u2019s ruin and my sister\u2019s death had not fallen on me like a\r\n\r\n      thunder-bolt from a clear sky.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Are you the Count\u2019s director?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If I were, could I place you with him? What priest could be capable of\r\n\r\n      taking advantage of the secrets which he learns at the tribunal of\r\n\r\n      repentance? No; you owe this position to his Highness, the Keeper of the\r\n\r\n      Seals. My dear Maurice, you will be as much at home there as in your\r\n\r\n      father\u2019s house. The Count will give you a salary of two thousand four\r\n\r\n      hundred francs, rooms in his house, and an allowance of twelve hundred\r\n\r\n      francs in lieu of feeding you. He will not admit you to his table, nor\r\n\r\n      give you a separate table, for fear of leaving you to the care of\r\n\r\n      servants. I did not accept the offer when it was made to me till I was\r\n\r\n      perfectly certain that Comte Octave\u2019s secretary was never to be a mere\r\n\r\n      upper servant. You will have an immense amount of work, for the Count is a\r\n\r\n      great worker; but when you leave him, you will be qualified to fill the\r\n\r\n      highest posts. I need not warn you to be discreet; that is the first\r\n\r\n      virtue of any man who hopes to hold public appointments.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou may conceive of my curiosity. Comte Octave, at that time, held one of\r\n\r\n      the highest legal appointments; he was in the confidence of Madame the\r\n\r\n      Dauphiness, who had just got him made a State Minister; he led such a life\r\n\r\n      as the Comte de Serizy, whom you all know, I think; but even more quietly,\r\n\r\n      for his house was in the Marais, Rue Payenne, and he hardly ever\r\n\r\n      entertained. His private life escaped public comment by its hermit-like\r\n\r\n      simplicity and by constant hard work.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet me describe my position to you in a few words. Having found in the\r\n\r\n      solemn headmaster of the College Saint-Louis a tutor to whom my uncle\r\n\r\n      delegated his authority, at the age of eighteen I had gone through all the\r\n\r\n      classes; I left school as innocent as a seminarist, full of faith, on\r\n\r\n      quitting Saint-Sulpice. My mother, on her deathbed, had made my uncle\r\n\r\n      promise that I should not become a priest, but I was as pious as though I\r\n\r\n      had to take orders. On leaving college, the Abbe Loraux took me into his\r\n\r\n      house and made me study law. During the four years of study requisite for\r\n\r\n      passing all the examinations, I worked hard, but chiefly at things outside\r\n\r\n      the arid fields of jurisprudence. Weaned from literature as I had been at\r\n\r\n      college, where I lived in the headmaster\u2019s house, I had a thirst to\r\n\r\n      quench. As soon as I had read a few modern masterpieces, the works of all\r\n\r\n      the preceding ages were greedily swallowed. I became crazy about the\r\n\r\n      theatre, and for a long time I went every night to the play, though my\r\n\r\n      uncle gave me only a hundred francs a month. This parsimony, to which the\r\n\r\n      good old man was compelled by his regard for the poor, had the effect of\r\n\r\n      keeping a young man\u2019s desires within reasonable limits.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I went to live with Comte Octave I was not indeed an innocent, but I\r\n\r\n      thought of my rare escapades as crimes. My uncle was so truly angelic, and\r\n\r\n      I was so much afraid of grieving him, that in all those four years I had\r\n\r\n      never spent a night out. The good man would wait till I came in to go to\r\n\r\n      bed. This maternal care had more power to keep me within bounds than the\r\n\r\n      sermons and reproaches with which the life of a young man is diversified\r\n\r\n      in a puritanical home. I was a stranger to the various circles which make\r\n\r\n      up the world of Paris society; I only knew some women of the better sort,\r\n\r\n      and none of the inferior class but those I saw as I walked about, or in\r\n\r\n      the boxes at the play, and then only from the depths of the pit where I\r\n\r\n      sat. If, at that period, any one had said to me, \u2018You will see Canalis, or\r\n\r\n      Camille Maupin,\u2019 I should have felt hot coals in my head and in my bowels.\r\n\r\n      Famous people were to me as gods, who neither spoke, nor walked, nor ate\r\n\r\n      like other mortals.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow many tales of the Thousand-and-one Nights are comprehended in the\r\n\r\n      ripening of a youth! How many wonderful lamps must we have rubbed before\r\n\r\n      we understand that the True Wonderful Lamp is either luck, or work, or\r\n\r\n      genius. In some men this dream of the aroused spirit is but brief; mine\r\n\r\n      has lasted until now! In those days I always went to sleep as Grand Duke\r\n\r\n      of Tuscany,\u2014as a millionaire,\u2014as beloved by a princess,\u2014or\r\n\r\n      famous! So to enter the service of Comte Octave, and have a hundred louis\r\n\r\n      a year, was entering on independent life. I had glimpses of some chance of\r\n\r\n      getting into society, and seeking for what my heart desired most, a\r\n\r\n      protectress, who would rescue me from the paths of danger, which a young\r\n\r\n      man of two-and-twenty can hardly help treading, however prudent and well\r\n\r\n      brought up he may be. I began to be afraid of myself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe persistent study of other people\u2019s rights into which I had plunged\r\n\r\n      was not always enough to repress painful imaginings. Yes, sometimes in\r\n\r\n      fancy I threw myself into theatrical life; I thought I could be a great\r\n\r\n      actor; I dreamed of endless triumphs and loves, knowing nothing of the\r\n\r\n      disillusion hidden behind the curtain, as everywhere else\u2014for every\r\n\r\n      stage has its reverse behind the scenes. I have gone out sometimes, my\r\n\r\n      heart boiling, carried away by an impulse to rush hunting through Paris,\r\n\r\n      to attach myself to some handsome woman I might meet, to follow her to her\r\n\r\n      door, watch her, write to her, throw myself on her mercy, and conquer her\r\n\r\n      by sheer force of passion. My poor uncle, a heart consumed by charity, a\r\n\r\n      child of seventy years, as clear-sighted as God, as guileless as a man of\r\n\r\n      genius, no doubt read the tumult of my soul; for when he felt the tether\r\n\r\n      by which he held me strained too tightly and ready to break, he would\r\n\r\n      never fail to say, \u2018Here, Maurice, you too are poor! Here are twenty\r\n\r\n      francs; go and amuse yourself, you are not a priest!\u2019 And if you could\r\n\r\n      have seen the dancing light that gilded his gray eyes, the smile that\r\n\r\n      relaxed his fine lips, puckering the corners of his mouth, the adorable\r\n\r\n      expression of that august face, whose native ugliness was redeemed by the\r\n\r\n      spirit of an apostle, you would understand the feeling which made me\r\n\r\n      answer the Cure of White Friars only with a kiss, as if he had been my\r\n\r\n      mother.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In Comte Octave you will find not a master, but a friend,\u2019 said my uncle\r\n\r\n      on the way to the Rue Payenne. \u2018But he is distrustful, or to be more\r\n\r\n      exact, he is cautious. The statesman\u2019s friendship can be won only with\r\n\r\n      time; for in spite of his deep insight and his habit of gauging men, he\r\n\r\n      was deceived by the man you are succeeding, and nearly became a victim to\r\n\r\n      his abuse of confidence. This is enough to guide you in your behavior to\r\n\r\n      him.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen we knocked at the enormous outer door of a house as large as the\r\n\r\n      Hotel Carnavalet, with a courtyard in front and a garden behind, the sound\r\n\r\n      rang as in a desert. While my uncle inquired of an old porter in livery if\r\n\r\n      the Count were at home, I cast my eyes, seeing everything at once, over\r\n\r\n      the courtyard where the cobblestones were hidden in the grass, the\r\n\r\n      blackened walls where little gardens were flourishing above the\r\n\r\n      decorations of the elegant architecture, and on the roof, as high as that\r\n\r\n      of the Tuileries. The balustrade of the upper balconies was eaten away.\r\n\r\n      Through a magnificent colonnade I could see a second court on one side,\r\n\r\n      where were the offices; the door was rotting. An old coachman was there\r\n\r\n      cleaning an old carriage. The indifferent air of this servant allowed me\r\n\r\n      to assume that the handsome stables, where of old so many horses had\r\n\r\n      whinnied, now sheltered two at most. The handsome facade of the house\r\n\r\n      seemed to me gloomy, like that of a mansion belonging to the State or the\r\n\r\n      Crown, and given up to some public office. A bell rang as we walked\r\n\r\n      across, my uncle and I, from the porter\u2019s lodge\u2014Inquire of the\r\n\r\n      Porter was still written over the door\u2014towards the outside\r\n\r\n      steps, where a footman came out in a livery like that of Labranche at the\r\n\r\n      Theatre Francais in the old stock plays. A visitor was so rare that the\r\n\r\n      servant was putting his coat on when he opened a glass door with small\r\n\r\n      panes, on each side of which the smoke of a lamp had traced patterns on\r\n\r\n      the walls.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA hall so magnificent as to be worthy of Versailles ended in a staircase\r\n\r\n      such as will never again be built in France, taking up as much space as\r\n\r\n      the whole of a modern house. As we went up the marble steps, as cold as\r\n\r\n      tombstones, and wide enough for eight persons to walk abreast, our tread\r\n\r\n      echoed under sonorous vaulting. The banister charmed the eye by its\r\n\r\n      miraculous workmanship\u2014goldsmith\u2019s work in iron\u2014wrought by the\r\n\r\n      fancy of an artist of the time of Henri III. Chilled as by an icy mantle\r\n\r\n      that fell on our shoulders, we went through ante-rooms, drawing-rooms\r\n\r\n      opening one out of the other, with carpetless parquet floors, and\r\n\r\n      furnished with such splendid antiquities as from thence would find their\r\n\r\n      way to the curiosity dealers. At last we reached a large study in a cross\r\n\r\n      wing, with all the windows looking into an immense garden.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Monsieur le Cure of the White Friars, and his nephew, Monsieur de\r\n\r\n      l\u2019Hostal,\u2019 said Labranche, to whose care the other theatrical servant had\r\n\r\n      consigned us in the first ante-chamber.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cComte Octave, dressed in long trousers and a gray flannel morning coat,\r\n\r\n      rose from his seat by a huge writing-table, came to the fireplace, and\r\n\r\n      signed to me to sit down, while he went forward to take my uncle\u2019s hands,\r\n\r\n      which he pressed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Though I am in the parish of Saint-Paul,\u2019 said he, \u2018I could scarcely\r\n\r\n      have failed to hear of the Cure of the White Friars, and I am happy to\r\n\r\n      make his acquaintance.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Your Excellency is most kind,\u2019 replied my uncle. \u2018I have brought to you\r\n\r\n      my only remaining relation. While I believe that I am offering a good gift\r\n\r\n      to your Excellency, I hope at the same time to give my nephew a second\r\n\r\n      father.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018As to that, I can only reply, Monsieur l\u2019Abbe, when we shall have tried\r\n\r\n      each other,\u2019 said Comte Octave. \u2018Your name?\u2019 he added to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Maurice.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He has taken his doctor\u2019s degree in law,\u2019 my uncle observed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Very good, very good!\u2019 said the Count, looking at me from head to foot.\r\n\r\n      \u2018Monsieur l\u2019Abbe, I hope that for your nephew\u2019s sake in the first\r\n\r\n      instance, and then for mine, you will do me the honor of dining here every\r\n\r\n      Monday. That will be our family dinner, our family party.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy uncle and the Count then began to talk of religion from the political\r\n\r\n      point of view, of charitable institutes, the repression of crime, and I\r\n\r\n      could at my leisure study the man on whom my fate would henceforth depend.\r\n\r\n      The Count was of middle height; it was impossible to judge of his build on\r\n\r\n      account of his dress, but he seemed to me to be lean and spare. His face\r\n\r\n      was harsh and hollow; the features were refined. His mouth, which was\r\n\r\n      rather large, expressed both irony and kindliness. His forehead perhaps\r\n\r\n      too spacious, was as intimidating as that of a madman, all the more so\r\n\r\n      from the contrast of the lower part of the face, which ended squarely in a\r\n\r\n      short chin very near the lower lip. Small eyes, of turquoise blue, were as\r\n\r\n      keen and bright as those of the Prince de Talleyrand\u2014which I admired\r\n\r\n      at a later time\u2014and endowed, like the Prince\u2019s, with the faculty of\r\n\r\n      becoming expressionless to the verge of gloom; and they added to the\r\n\r\n      singularity of a face that was not pale but yellow. This complexion seemed\r\n\r\n      to bespeak an irritable temper and violent passions. His hair, already\r\n\r\n      silvered, and carefully dressed, seemed to furrow his head with streaks of\r\n\r\n      black and white alternately. The trimness of this head spoiled the\r\n\r\n      resemblance I had remarked in the Count to the wonderful monk described by\r\n\r\n      Lewis after Schedoni in the Confessional of the Black Penitents (The\r\n\r\n      Italian), a superior creation, as it seems to me, to The Monk.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Count was already shaved, having to attend early at the law courts.\r\n\r\n      Two candelabra with four lights, screened by lamp-shades, were still\r\n\r\n      burning at the opposite ends of the writing-table, and showed plainly that\r\n\r\n      the magistrate rose long before daylight. His hands, which I saw when he\r\n\r\n      took hold of the bell-pull to summon his servant, were extremely fine, and\r\n\r\n      as white as a woman\u2019s.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs I tell you this story,\u201d said the Consul-General, interrupting himself,\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am altering the titles and the social position of this gentleman, while\r\n\r\n      placing him in circumstances analogous to what his really were. His\r\n\r\n      profession, rank, luxury, fortune, and style of living were the same; all\r\n\r\n      these details are true, but I would not be false to my benefactor, nor to\r\n\r\n      my usual habits of discretion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cInstead of feeling\u2014as I really was, socially speaking\u2014an\r\n\r\n      insect in the presence of an eagle,\u201d the narrator went on after a pause,\r\n\r\n      \u201cI felt I know not what indefinable impression from the Count\u2019s\r\n\r\n      appearance, which, however, I can now account for. Artists of genius\u201d (and\r\n\r\n      he bowed gracefully to the Ambassador, the distinguished lady, and the two\r\n\r\n      Frenchmen), \u201creal statesmen, poets, a general who has commanded armies\u2014in\r\n\r\n      short, all really great minds are simple, and their simplicity places you\r\n\r\n      on a level with themselves.\u2014You who are all of superior minds,\u201d he\r\n\r\n      said, addressing his guests, \u201chave perhaps observed how feeling can bridge\r\n\r\n      over the distances created by society. If we are inferior to you in\r\n\r\n      intellect, we can be your equals in devoted friendship. By the temperature\u2014allow\r\n\r\n      me the word\u2014of our hearts I felt myself as near my patron as I was\r\n\r\n      far below him in rank. In short, the soul has its clairvoyance; it has\r\n\r\n      presentiments of suffering, grief, joy, antagonism, or hatred in others.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI vaguely discerned the symptoms of a mystery, from recognizing in the\r\n\r\n      Count the same effects of physiognomy as I had observed in my uncle. The\r\n\r\n      exercise of virtue, serenity of conscience, and purity of mind had\r\n\r\n      transfigured my uncle, who from being ugly had become quite beautiful. I\r\n\r\n      detected a metamorphosis of a reverse kind in the Count\u2019s face; at the\r\n\r\n      first glance I thought he was about fifty-five, but after an attentive\r\n\r\n      examination I found youth entombed under the ice of a great sorrow, under\r\n\r\n      the fatigue of persistent study, under the glowing hues of some suppressed\r\n\r\n      passion. At a word from my uncle the Count\u2019s eyes recovered for a moment\r\n\r\n      the softness of the periwinkle flower, and he had an admiring smile, which\r\n\r\n      revealed what I believed to be his real age, about forty. These\r\n\r\n      observations I made, not then but afterwards, as I recalled the\r\n\r\n      circumstances of my visit.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man-servant came in carrying a tray with his master\u2019s breakfast on\r\n\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I did not ask for breakfast,\u2019 remarked the Count; \u2018but leave it, and\r\n\r\n      show monsieur to his rooms.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI followed the servant, who led the way to a complete set of pretty\r\n\r\n      rooms, under a terrace, between the great courtyard and the servants\u2019 \r\n\r\n      quarters, over a corridor of communication between the kitchens and the\r\n\r\n      grand staircase. When I returned to the Count\u2019s study, I overheard, before\r\n\r\n      opening the door, my uncle pronouncing this judgment on me:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He may do wrong, for he has strong feelings, and we are all liable to\r\n\r\n      honorable mistakes; but he has no vices.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said the Count, with a kindly look, \u2018do you like yourself there?\r\n\r\n      Tell me. There are so many rooms in this barrack that, if you were not\r\n\r\n      comfortable, I could put you elsewhere.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018At my uncle\u2019s I had but one room,\u2019 replied I.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, you can settle yourself this evening,\u2019 said the Count, \u2018for your\r\n\r\n      possessions, no doubt, are such as all students own, and a hackney coach\r\n\r\n      will be enough to convey them. To-day we will all three dine together,\u2019 \r\n\r\n      and he looked at my uncle.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA splendid library opened from the Count\u2019s study, and he took us in\r\n\r\n      there, showing me a pretty little recess decorated with paintings, which\r\n\r\n      had formerly served, no doubt, as an oratory.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018This is your cell,\u2019 said he. \u2018You will sit there when you have to work\r\n\r\n      with me, for you will not be tethered by a chain;\u2019 and he explained in\r\n\r\n      detail the kind and duration of my employment with him. As I listened I\r\n\r\n      felt that he was a great political teacher.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt took me about a month to familiarize myself with people and things, to\r\n\r\n      learn the duties of my new office, and accustom myself to the Count\u2019s\r\n\r\n      methods. A secretary necessarily watches the man who makes use of him.\r\n\r\n      That man\u2019s tastes, passions, temper, and manias become the subject of\r\n\r\n      involuntary study. The union of their two minds is at once more and less\r\n\r\n      than a marriage.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDuring these months the Count and I reciprocally studied each other. I\r\n\r\n      learned with astonishment that Comte Octave was but thirty-seven years\r\n\r\n      old. The merely superficial peacefulness of his life and the propriety of\r\n\r\n      his conduct were the outcome not solely of a deep sense of duty and of\r\n\r\n      stoical reflection; in my constant intercourse with this man\u2014an\r\n\r\n      extraordinary man to those who knew him well\u2014I felt vast depths\r\n\r\n      beneath his toil, beneath his acts of politeness, his mask of benignity,\r\n\r\n      his assumption of resignation, which so closely resembled calmness that it\r\n\r\n      is easy to mistake it. Just as when walking through forest-lands certain\r\n\r\n      soils give forth under our feet a sound which enables us to guess whether\r\n\r\n      they are dense masses of stone or a void; so intense egoism, though hidden\r\n\r\n      under the flowers of politeness, and subterranean caverns eaten out by\r\n\r\n      sorrow sound hollow under the constant touch of familiar life. It was\r\n\r\n      sorrow and not despondency that dwelt in that really great soul. The Count\r\n\r\n      had understood that actions, deeds, are the supreme law of social man. And\r\n\r\n      he went on his way in spite of secret wounds, looking to the future with a\r\n\r\n      tranquil eye, like a martyr full of faith.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis concealed sadness, the bitter disenchantment from which he suffered,\r\n\r\n      had not led him into philosophical deserts of incredulity; this brave\r\n\r\n      statesman was religious, without ostentation; he always attended the\r\n\r\n      earliest mass at Saint-Paul\u2019s for pious workmen and servants. Not one of\r\n\r\n      his friends, no one at Court, knew that he so punctually fulfilled the\r\n\r\n      practice of religion. He was addicted to God as some men are addicted to a\r\n\r\n      vice, with the greatest mystery. Thus one day I came to find the Count at\r\n\r\n      the summit of an Alp of woe much higher than that on which many are who\r\n\r\n      think themselves the most tried; who laugh at the passions and the beliefs\r\n\r\n      of others because they have conquered their own; who play variations in\r\n\r\n      every key of irony and disdain. He did not mock at those who still follow\r\n\r\n      hope into the swamps whither she leads, nor those who climb a peak to be\r\n\r\n      alone, nor those who persist in the fight, reddening the arena with their\r\n\r\n      blood and strewing it with their illusions. He looked on the world as a\r\n\r\n      whole; he mastered its beliefs; he listened to its complaining; he was\r\n\r\n      doubtful of affection, and yet more of self-sacrifice; but this great and\r\n\r\n      stern judge pitied them, or admired them, not with transient enthusiasm,\r\n\r\n      but with silence, concentration, and the communion of a deeply-touched\r\n\r\n      soul. He was a sort of catholic Manfred, and unstained by crime, carrying\r\n\r\n      his choiceness into his faith, melting the snows by the fires of a sealed\r\n\r\n      volcano, holding converse with a star seen by himself alone!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI detected many dark riddles in his ordinary life. He evaded my gaze not\r\n\r\n      like a traveler who, following a path, disappears from time to time in\r\n\r\n      dells or ravines according to the formation of the soil, but like a\r\n\r\n      sharpshooter who is being watched, who wants to hide himself, and seeks a\r\n\r\n      cover. I could not account for his frequent absences at the times when he\r\n\r\n      was working the hardest, and of which he made no secret from me, for he\r\n\r\n      would say, \u2018Go on with this for me,\u2019 and trust me with the work in hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis man, wrapped in the threefold duties of the statesman, the judge,\r\n\r\n      and the orator, charmed me by a taste for flowers, which shows an elegant\r\n\r\n      mind, and which is shared by almost all persons of refinement. His garden\r\n\r\n      and his study were full of the rarest plants, but he always bought them\r\n\r\n      half-withered. Perhaps it pleased him to see such an image of his own\r\n\r\n      fate! He was faded like these dying flowers, whose almost decaying\r\n\r\n      fragrance mounted strangely to his brain. The Count loved his country; he\r\n\r\n      devoted himself to public interests with the frenzy of a heart that seeks\r\n\r\n      to cheat some other passion; but the studies and work into which he threw\r\n\r\n      himself were not enough for him; there were frightful struggles in his\r\n\r\n      mind, of which some echoes reached me. Finally, he would give utterance to\r\n\r\n      harrowing aspirations for happiness, and it seemed to me he ought yet to\r\n\r\n      be happy; but what was the obstacle? Was there a woman he loved? This was\r\n\r\n      a question I asked myself. You may imagine the extent of the circles of\r\n\r\n      torment that my mind had searched before coming to so simple and so\r\n\r\n      terrible a question. Notwithstanding his efforts, my patron did not\r\n\r\n      succeed in stifling the movements of his heart. Under his austere manner,\r\n\r\n      under the reserve of the magistrate, a passion rebelled, though coerced\r\n\r\n      with such force that no one but I who lived with him ever guessed the\r\n\r\n      secret. His motto seemed to be, \u2018I suffer, and am silent.\u2019 The escort of\r\n\r\n      respect and admiration which attended him; the friendship of workers as\r\n\r\n      valiant as himself\u2014Grandville and Serizy, both presiding judges\u2014had\r\n\r\n      no hold over the Count: either he told them nothing, or they knew all.\r\n\r\n      Impassible and lofty in public, the Count betrayed the man only on rare\r\n\r\n      intervals when, alone in his garden or his study, he supposed himself\r\n\r\n      unobserved; but then he was a child again, he gave course to the tears\r\n\r\n      hidden beneath the toga, to the excitement which, if wrongly interpreted,\r\n\r\n      might have damaged his credit for perspicacity as a statesman.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen all this had become to me a matter of certainty, Comte Octave had\r\n\r\n      all the attractions of a problem, and won on my affection as much as\r\n\r\n      though he had been my own father. Can you enter into the feeling of\r\n\r\n      curiosity, tempered by respect? What catastrophe had blasted this learned\r\n\r\n      man, who, like Pitt, had devoted himself from the age of eighteen to the\r\n\r\n      studies indispensable to power, while he had no ambition; this judge, who\r\n\r\n      thoroughly knew the law of nations, political law, civil and criminal law,\r\n\r\n      and who could find in these a weapon against every anxiety, against every\r\n\r\n      mistake; this profound legislator, this serious writer, this pious\r\n\r\n      celibate whose life sufficiently proved that he was open to no reproach? A\r\n\r\n      criminal could not have been more hardly punished by God than was my\r\n\r\n      master; sorrow had robbed him of half his slumbers; he never slept more\r\n\r\n      than four hours. What struggle was it that went on in the depths of these\r\n\r\n      hours apparently so calm, so studious, passing without a sound or a\r\n\r\n      murmur, during which I often detected him, when the pen had dropped from\r\n\r\n      his fingers, with his head resting on one hand, his eyes like two fixed\r\n\r\n      stars, and sometimes wet with tears? How could the waters of that living\r\n\r\n      spring flow over the burning strand without being dried up by the\r\n\r\n      subterranean fire? Was there below it, as there is under the sea, between\r\n\r\n      it and the central fires of the globe, a bed of granite? And would the\r\n\r\n      volcano burst at last?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSometimes the Count would give me a look of that sagacious and keen-eyed\r\n\r\n      curiosity by which one man searches another when he desires an accomplice;\r\n\r\n      then he shunned my eye as he saw it open a mouth, so to speak, insisting\r\n\r\n      on a reply, and seeming to say, \u2018Speak first!\u2019 Now and then Comte Octave\u2019s\r\n\r\n      melancholy was surly and gruff. If these spurts of temper offended me, he\r\n\r\n      could get over it without thinking of asking my pardon; but then his\r\n\r\n      manners were gracious to the point of Christian humility.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I became attached like a son to this man\u2014to me such a mystery,\r\n\r\n      but so intelligible to the outer world, to whom the epithet eccentric is\r\n\r\n      enough to account for all the enigmas of the heart\u2014I changed the\r\n\r\n      state of the house. Neglect of his own interests was carried by the Count\r\n\r\n      to the length of folly in the management of his affairs. Possessing an\r\n\r\n      income of about a hundred and sixty thousand francs, without including the\r\n\r\n      emoluments of his appointments\u2014three of which did not come under the\r\n\r\n      law against plurality\u2014he spent sixty thousand, of which at least\r\n\r\n      thirty thousand went to his servants. By the end of the first year I had\r\n\r\n      got rid of all these rascals, and begged His Excellency to use his\r\n\r\n      influence in helping me to get honest servants. By the end of the second\r\n\r\n      year the Count, better fed and better served, enjoyed the comforts of\r\n\r\n      modern life; he had fine horses, supplied by a coachman to whom I paid so\r\n\r\n      much a month for each horse; his dinners on his reception days, furnished\r\n\r\n      by Chevet at a price agreed upon, did him credit; his daily meals were\r\n\r\n      prepared by an excellent cook found by my uncle, and helped by two\r\n\r\n      kitchenmaids. The expenditure for housekeeping, not including purchases,\r\n\r\n      was no more than thirty thousand francs a year; we had two additional\r\n\r\n      men-servants, whose care restored the poetical aspect of the house; for\r\n\r\n      this old palace, splendid even in its rust, had an air of dignity which\r\n\r\n      neglect had dishonored.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I am no longer astonished,\u2019 said he, on hearing of these results, \u2018at\r\n\r\n      the fortunes made by servants. In seven years I have had two cooks, who\r\n\r\n      have become rich restaurant-keepers.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEarly in the year 1826 the Count had, no doubt, ceased to watch me, and\r\n\r\n      we were as closely attached as two men can be when one is subordinate to\r\n\r\n      the other. He had never spoken to me of my future prospects, but he had\r\n\r\n      taken an interest, both as a master and as a father, in training me. He\r\n\r\n      often required me to collect materials for his most arduous labors; I drew\r\n\r\n      up some of his reports, and he corrected them, showing the difference\r\n\r\n      between his interpretation of the law, his views and mine. When at last I\r\n\r\n      had produced a document which he could give in as his own he was\r\n\r\n      delighted; this satisfaction was my reward, and he could see that I took\r\n\r\n      it so. This little incident produced an extraordinary effect on a soul\r\n\r\n      which seemed so stern. The Count pronounced sentence on me, to use a legal\r\n\r\n      phrase, as supreme and royal judge; he took my head in his hands, and\r\n\r\n      kissed me on the forehead.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Maurice,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018you are no longer my apprentice; I know not yet\r\n\r\n      what you will be to me\u2014but if no change occurs in my life, perhaps\r\n\r\n      you will take the place of a son.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cComte Octave had introduced me to the best houses in Paris, whither I\r\n\r\n      went in his stead, with his servants and carriage, on the too frequent\r\n\r\n      occasions when, on the point of starting, he changed his mind, and sent\r\n\r\n      for a hackney cab to take him\u2014Where?\u2014that was the mystery. By\r\n\r\n      the welcome I met with I could judge of the Count\u2019s feelings towards me,\r\n\r\n      and the earnestness of his recommendations. He supplied all my wants with\r\n\r\n      the thoughtfulness of a father, and with all the greater liberality\r\n\r\n      because my modesty left it to him always to think of me. Towards the end\r\n\r\n      of January 1827, at the house of the Comtesse de Serizy, I had such\r\n\r\n      persistent ill-luck at play that I lost two thousand francs, and I would\r\n\r\n      not draw them out of my savings. Next morning I asked myself, \u2018Had I\r\n\r\n      better ask my uncle for the money, or put my confidence in the Count?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI decided on the second alternative.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Yesterday,\u2019 said I, when he was at breakfast, \u2018I lost persistently at\r\n\r\n      play; I was provoked, and went on; I owe two thousand francs. Will you\r\n\r\n      allow me to draw the sum on account of my year\u2019s salary?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said he, with the sweetest smile; \u2018when a man plays in society, he\r\n\r\n      must have a gambling purse. Draw six thousand francs; pay your debts.\r\n\r\n      Henceforth we must go halves; for since you are my representative on most\r\n\r\n      occasions, your self-respect must not be made to suffer for it.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI made no speech of thanks. Thanks would have been superfluous between\r\n\r\n      us. This shade shows the character of our relations. And yet we had not\r\n\r\n      yet unlimited confidence in each other; he did not open to me the vast\r\n\r\n      subterranean chambers which I had detected in his secret life; and I, for\r\n\r\n      my part, never said to him, \u2018What ails you? From what are you suffering?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat could he be doing during those long evenings? He would often come in\r\n\r\n      on foot or in a hackney cab when I returned in a carriage\u2014I, his\r\n\r\n      secretary! Was so pious a man a prey to vices hidden under hypocrisy? Did\r\n\r\n      he expend all the powers of his mind to satisfy a jealousy more dexterous\r\n\r\n      than Othello\u2019s? Did he live with some woman unworthy of him? One morning,\r\n\r\n      on returning from I have forgotten what shop, where I had just paid a\r\n\r\n      bill, between the Church of Saint-Paul and the Hotel de Ville, I came\r\n\r\n      across Comte Octave in such eager conversation with an old woman that he\r\n\r\n      did not see me. The appearance of this hag filled me with strange\r\n\r\n      suspicions, suspicions that were all the better founded because I never\r\n\r\n      found that the Count invested his savings. Is it not shocking to think of?\r\n\r\n      I was constituting myself my patron\u2019s censor. At that time I knew that he\r\n\r\n      had more than six hundred thousand francs to invest; and if he had bought\r\n\r\n      securities of any kind, his confidence in me was so complete in all that\r\n\r\n      concerned his pecuniary interests, that I certainly should have known it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSometimes, in the morning, the Count took exercise in his garden, to and\r\n\r\n      fro, like a man to whom a walk is the hippogryph ridden by dreamy\r\n\r\n      melancholy. He walked and walked! And he rubbed his hands enough to rub\r\n\r\n      the skin off. And then, if I met him unexpectedly as he came to the angle\r\n\r\n      of a path, I saw his face beaming. His eyes, instead of the hardness of a\r\n\r\n      turquoise, had that velvety softness of the blue periwinkle, which had so\r\n\r\n      much struck me on the occasion of my first visit, by reason of the\r\n\r\n      astonishing contrast in the two different looks; the look of a happy man,\r\n\r\n      and the look of an unhappy man. Two or three times at such a moment he had\r\n\r\n      taken me by the arm and led me on; then he had said, \u2018What have you come\r\n\r\n      to ask?\u2019 instead of pouring out his joy into my heart that opened to him.\r\n\r\n      But more often, especially since I could do his work for him and write his\r\n\r\n      reports, the unhappy man would sit for hours staring at the goldfish that\r\n\r\n      swarmed in a handsome marble basin in the middle of the garden, round\r\n\r\n      which grew an amphitheatre of the finest flowers. He, an accomplished\r\n\r\n      statesman, seemed to have succeeded in making a passion of the mechanical\r\n\r\n      amusement of crumbling bread to fishes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is how the drama was disclosed of this second inner life, so deeply\r\n\r\n      ravaged and storm-tossed, where, in a circle overlooked by Dante in his Inferno,\r\n\r\n      horrible joys had their birth.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Consul-General paused.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn a certain Monday,\u201d he resumed, \u201cas chance would have it, M. le\r\n\r\n      President de Grandville and M. de Serizy (at that time Vice-President of\r\n\r\n      the Council of State) had come to hold a meeting at Comte Octave\u2019s house.\r\n\r\n      They formed a committee of three, of which I was the secretary. The Count\r\n\r\n      had already got me the appointment of Auditor to the Council of State. All\r\n\r\n      the documents requisite for their inquiry into the political matter\r\n\r\n      privately submitted to these three gentlemen were laid out on one of the\r\n\r\n      long tables in the library. MM. de Grandville and de Serizy had trusted to\r\n\r\n      the Count to make the preliminary examination of the papers relating to\r\n\r\n      the matter. To avoid the necessity for carrying all the papers to M. de\r\n\r\n      Serizy, as president of the commission, it was decided that they should\r\n\r\n      meet first in the Rue Payenne. The Cabinet at the Tuileries attached great\r\n\r\n      importance to this piece of work, of which the chief burden fell on me\u2014and\r\n\r\n      to which I owed my appointment, in the course of that year, to be Master\r\n\r\n      of Appeals.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThough the Comtes de Grandville and de Serizy, whose habits were much the\r\n\r\n      same as my patron\u2019s, never dined away from home, we were still discussing\r\n\r\n      the matter at a late hour, when we were startled by the man-servant\r\n\r\n      calling me aside to say, \u2018MM. the Cures of Saint-Paul and of the White\r\n\r\n      Friars have been waiting in the drawing-room for two hours.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was nine o\u2019clock.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, gentlemen, you find yourselves compelled to dine with priests,\u2019 \r\n\r\n      said Comte Octave to his colleagues. \u2018I do not know whether Grandville can\r\n\r\n      overcome his horror of a priest\u2019s gown\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It depends on the priest.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018One of them is my uncle, and the other is the Abbe Gaudron,\u2019 said I. \u2018Do\r\n\r\n      not be alarmed; the Abbe Fontanon is no longer second priest at Saint-Paul\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, let us dine,\u2019 replied the President de Grandville. \u2018A bigot\r\n\r\n      frightens me, but there is no one so cheerful as a truly pious man.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe went into the drawing-room. The dinner was delightful. Men of real\r\n\r\n      information, politicians to whom business gives both consummate experience\r\n\r\n      and the practice of speech, are admirable story-tellers, when they tell\r\n\r\n      stories. With them there is no medium; they are either heavy, or they are\r\n\r\n      sublime. In this delightful sport Prince Metternich is as good as Charles\r\n\r\n      Nodier. The fun of a statesman, cut in facets like a diamond, is sharp,\r\n\r\n      sparkling, and full of sense. Being sure that the proprieties would be\r\n\r\n      observed by these three superior men, my uncle allowed his wit full play,\r\n\r\n      a refined wit, gentle, penetrating, and elegant, like that of all men who\r\n\r\n      are accustomed to conceal their thoughts under the black robe. And you may\r\n\r\n      rely upon it, there was nothing vulgar nor idle in this light talk, which\r\n\r\n      I would compare, for its effect on the soul, to Rossini\u2019s music.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Abbe Gaudron was, as M. de Grandville said, a Saint Peter rather than\r\n\r\n      a Saint Paul, a peasant full of faith, as square on his feet as he was\r\n\r\n      tall, a sacerdotal of whose ignorance in matters of the world and of\r\n\r\n      literature enlivened the conversation by guileless amazement and\r\n\r\n      unexpected questions. They came to talking of one of the plague spots of\r\n\r\n      social life, of which we were just now speaking\u2014adultery. My uncle\r\n\r\n      remarked on the contradiction which the legislators of the Code, still\r\n\r\n      feeling the blows of the revolutionary storm, had established between\r\n\r\n      civil and religious law, and which he said was at the root of all the\r\n\r\n      mischief.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In the eyes of the Church,\u2019 said he, \u2018adultery is a crime; in those of\r\n\r\n      your tribunals it is a misdemeanor. Adultery drives to the police court in\r\n\r\n      a carriage instead of standing at the bar to be tried. Napoleon\u2019s Council\r\n\r\n      of State, touched with tenderness towards erring women, was quite\r\n\r\n      inefficient. Ought they not in this case to have harmonized the civil and\r\n\r\n      the religious law, and have sent the guilty wife to a convent, as of old?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018To a convent!\u2019 said M. de Serizy. \u2018They must first have created\r\n\r\n      convents, and in those days monasteries were being turned into barracks.\r\n\r\n      Besides, think of what you say, M. l\u2019Abbe\u2014give to God what society\r\n\r\n      would have none of?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Oh!\u2019 said the Comte de Grandville, \u2018you do not know France. They were\r\n\r\n      obliged to leave the husband free to take proceedings: well, there are not\r\n\r\n      ten cases of adultery brought up in a year.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018M. l\u2019Abbe preaches for his own saint, for it was Jesus Christ who\r\n\r\n      invented adultery,\u2019 said Comte Octave. \u2018In the East, the cradle of the\r\n\r\n      human race, woman was merely a luxury, and there was regarded as a\r\n\r\n      chattel; no virtues were demanded of her but obedience and beauty. By\r\n\r\n      exalting the soul above the body, the modern family in Europe\u2014a\r\n\r\n      daughter of Christ\u2014invented indissoluble marriage, and made it a\r\n\r\n      sacrament.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Ah! the Church saw the difficulties,\u2019 exclaimed M. de Grandville.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018This institution has given rise to a new world,\u2019 the Count went on with\r\n\r\n      a smile. \u2018But the practices of that world will never be that of a climate\r\n\r\n      where women are marriageable at seven years of age, and more than old at\r\n\r\n      five-and-twenty. The Catholic Church overlooked the needs of half the\r\n\r\n      globe.\u2014So let us discuss Europe only.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Is woman our superior or our inferior? That is the real question so far\r\n\r\n      as we are concerned. If woman is our inferior, by placing her on so high a\r\n\r\n      level as the Church does, fearful punishments for adultery were needful.\r\n\r\n      And formerly that was what was done. The cloister or death sums up early\r\n\r\n      legislation. But since then practice has modified the law, as is always\r\n\r\n      the case. The throne served as a hotbed for adultery, and the increase of\r\n\r\n      this inviting crime marks the decline of the dogmas of the Catholic\r\n\r\n      Church. In these days, in cases where the Church now exacts no more than\r\n\r\n      sincere repentance from the erring wife, society is satisfied with a\r\n\r\n      brand-mark instead of an execution. The law still condemns the guilty, but\r\n\r\n      it no longer terrifies them. In short, there are two standards of morals:\r\n\r\n      that of the world, and that of the Code. Where the Code is weak, as I\r\n\r\n      admit with our dear Abbe, the world is audacious and satirical. There are\r\n\r\n      so few judges who would not gladly have committed the fault against which\r\n\r\n      they hurl the rather stolid thunders of their \u201cInasmuch.\u201d The world, which\r\n\r\n      gives the lie to the law alike in its rejoicings, in its habits, and in\r\n\r\n      its pleasures, is severer than the Code and the Church; the world punishes\r\n\r\n      a blunder after encouraging hypocrisy. The whole economy of the law on\r\n\r\n      marriage seems to me to require reconstruction from the bottom to the top.\r\n\r\n      The French law would be perfect perhaps if it excluded daughters from\r\n\r\n      inheriting.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018We three among us know the question very thoroughly,\u2019 said the Comte de\r\n\r\n      Grandville with a laugh. \u2018I have a wife I cannot live with. Serizy has a\r\n\r\n      wife who will not live with him. As for you, Octave, yours ran away from\r\n\r\n      you. So we three represent every case of the conjugal conscience, and, no\r\n\r\n      doubt, if ever divorce is brought in again, we shall form the committee.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOctave\u2019s fork dropped on his glass, broke it, and broke his plate. He had\r\n\r\n      turned as pale as death, and flashed a thunderous glare at M. de\r\n\r\n      Grandville, by which he hinted at my presence, and which I caught.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Forgive me, my dear fellow. I did not see Maurice,\u2019 the President went\r\n\r\n      on. \u2018Serizy and I, after being the witnesses to your marriage, became your\r\n\r\n      accomplices; I did not think I was committing an indiscretion in the\r\n\r\n      presence of these two venerable priests.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. de Serizy changed the subject by relating all he had done to please\r\n\r\n      his wife without ever succeeding. The old man concluded that it was\r\n\r\n      impossible to regulate human sympathies and antipathies; he maintained\r\n\r\n      that social law was never more perfect than when it was nearest to natural\r\n\r\n      law. Now Nature takes no account of the affinities of souls; her aim is\r\n\r\n      fulfilled by the propagation of the species. Hence, the Code, in its\r\n\r\n      present form, was wise in leaving a wide latitude to chance. The\r\n\r\n      incapacity of daughters to inherit so long as there were male heirs was an\r\n\r\n      excellent provision, whether to hinder the degeneration of the race, or to\r\n\r\n      make households happier by abolishing scandalous unions and giving the\r\n\r\n      sole preference to moral qualities and beauty.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But then,\u2019 he exclaimed, lifting his hand with a gesture of disgust,\r\n\r\n      \u2018how are we to perfect legislation in a country which insists on bringing\r\n\r\n      together seven or eight hundred legislators!\u2014After all, if I am\r\n\r\n      sacrificed,\u2019 he added, \u2018I have a child to succeed me.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Setting aside all the religious question,\u2019 my uncle said, \u2018I would\r\n\r\n      remark to your Excellency that Nature only owes us life, and that it is\r\n\r\n      society that owes us happiness. Are you a father?\u2019 asked my uncle.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And I\u2014have I any children?\u2019 said Comte Octave in a hollow voice,\r\n\r\n      and his tone made such an impression that there was no more talk of wives\r\n\r\n      or marriage.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen coffee had been served, the two Counts and the two priests stole\r\n\r\n      away, seeing that poor Octave had fallen into a fit of melancholy which\r\n\r\n      prevented his noticing their disappearance. My patron was sitting in an\r\n\r\n      armchair by the fire, in the attitude of a man crushed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You now know the secret of my life, said he to me on noticing that we\r\n\r\n      were alone. \u2018After three years of married life, one evening when I came in\r\n\r\n      I found a letter in which the Countess announced her flight. The letter\r\n\r\n      did not lack dignity, for it is in the nature of women to preserve some\r\n\r\n      virtues even when committing that horrible sin.\u2014The story is now\r\n\r\n      that my wife went abroad in a ship that was wrecked; she is supposed to be\r\n\r\n      dead. I have lived alone for seven years!\u2014Enough for this evening,\r\n\r\n      Maurice. We will talk of my situation when I have grown used to the idea\r\n\r\n      of speaking of it to you. When we suffer from a chronic disease, it needs\r\n\r\n      time to become accustomed to improvement. That improvement often seems to\r\n\r\n      be merely another aspect of the complaint.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI went to bed greatly agitated; for the mystery, far from being\r\n\r\n      explained, seemed to me more obscure than ever. I foresaw some strange\r\n\r\n      drama indeed, for I understood that there could be no vulgar difference\r\n\r\n      between the woman that Count could choose and such a character as his. The\r\n\r\n      events which had driven the Countess to leave a man so noble, so amiable,\r\n\r\n      so perfect, so loving, so worthy to be loved, must have been singular, to\r\n\r\n      say the least. M. de Grandville\u2019s remark had been like a torch flung into\r\n\r\n      the caverns over which I had so long been walking; and though the flame\r\n\r\n      lighted them but dimly, my eyes could perceive their wide extent! I could\r\n\r\n      imagine the Count\u2019s sufferings without knowing their depths or their\r\n\r\n      bitterness. That sallow face, those parched temples, those overwhelming\r\n\r\n      studies, those moments of absentmindedness, the smallest details of the\r\n\r\n      life of this married bachelor, all stood out in luminous relief during the\r\n\r\n      hour of mental questioning, which is, as it were, the twilight before\r\n\r\n      sleep, and to which any man would have given himself up, as I did.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! how I loved my poor master! He seemed to me sublime. I read a poem of\r\n\r\n      melancholy, I saw perpetual activity in the heart I had accused of being\r\n\r\n      torpid. Must not supreme grief always come at last to stagnation? Had this\r\n\r\n      judge, who had so much in his power, ever revenged himself? Was he feeding\r\n\r\n      himself on her long agony? Is it not a remarkable thing in Paris to keep\r\n\r\n      anger always seething for ten years? What had Octave done since this great\r\n\r\n      misfortune\u2014for the separation of husband and wife is a great\r\n\r\n      misfortune in our day, when domestic life has become a social question,\r\n\r\n      which it never was of old?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe allowed a few days to pass on the watch, for great sorrows have a\r\n\r\n      diffidence of their own; but at last, one evening, the Count said in a\r\n\r\n      grave voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Stay.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis, as nearly as may be, is his story.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018My father had a ward, rich and lovely, who was sixteen at the time when\r\n\r\n      I came back from college to live in this old house. Honorine, who had been\r\n\r\n      brought up by my mother, was just awakening to life. Full of grace and of\r\n\r\n      childish ways, she dreamed of happiness as she would have dreamed of\r\n\r\n      jewels; perhaps happiness seemed to her the jewel of the soul. Her piety\r\n\r\n      was not free from puerile pleasures; for everything, even religion, was\r\n\r\n      poetry to her ingenuous heart. She looked to the future as a perpetual\r\n\r\n      fete. Innocent and pure, no delirium had disturbed her dream. Shame and\r\n\r\n      grief had never tinged her cheek nor moistened her eye. She did not even\r\n\r\n      inquire into the secret of her involuntary emotions on a fine spring day.\r\n\r\n      And then, she felt that she was weak and destined to obedience, and she\r\n\r\n      awaited marriage without wishing for it. Her smiling imagination knew\r\n\r\n      nothing of the corruption\u2014necessary perhaps\u2014which literature\r\n\r\n      imparts by depicting the passions; she knew nothing of the world, and was\r\n\r\n      ignorant of all the dangers of society. The dear child had suffered so\r\n\r\n      little that she had not even developed her courage. In short, her\r\n\r\n      guilelessness would have led her to walk fearless among serpents, like the\r\n\r\n      ideal figure of Innocence a painter once created. We lived together like\r\n\r\n      two brothers.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018At the end of a year I said to her one day, in the garden of this house,\r\n\r\n      by the basin, as we stood throwing crumbs to the fish:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Would you like that we should be married? With me you could do whatever\r\n\r\n      you please, while another man would make you unhappy.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Mamma,\u201d said she to my mother, who came out to join us, \u201cOctave and I\r\n\r\n      have agreed to be married\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"What! at seventeen?\u201d said my mother. \u201cNo, you must wait eighteen\r\n\r\n      months; and if eighteen months hence you like each other, well, your birth\r\n\r\n      and fortunes are equal, you can make a marriage which is suitable, as well\r\n\r\n      as being a love match.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018When I was six-and-twenty, and Honorine nineteen, we were married. Our\r\n\r\n      respect for my father and mother, old folks of the Bourbon Court, hindered\r\n\r\n      us from making this house fashionable, or renewing the furniture; we lived\r\n\r\n      on, as we had done in the past, as children. However, I went into society;\r\n\r\n      I initiated my wife into the world of fashion; and I regarded it as one of\r\n\r\n      my duties to instruct her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I recognized afterwards that marriages contracted under such\r\n\r\n      circumstances as ours bear in themselves a rock against which many\r\n\r\n      affections are wrecked, many prudent calculations, many lives. The husband\r\n\r\n      becomes a pedagogue, or, if you like, a professor, and love perishes under\r\n\r\n      the rod which, sooner or later, gives pain; for a young and handsome wife,\r\n\r\n      at once discreet and laughter-loving, will not accept any superiority\r\n\r\n      above that with which she is endowed by nature. Perhaps I was in the\r\n\r\n      wrong? During the difficult beginnings of a household I, perhaps, assumed\r\n\r\n      a magisterial tone? On the other hand, I may have made the mistake of\r\n\r\n      trusting too entirely to that artless nature; I kept no watch over the\r\n\r\n      Countess, in whom revolt seemed to me impossible? Alas! neither in\r\n\r\n      politics nor in domestic life has it yet been ascertained whether empires\r\n\r\n      and happiness are wrecked by too much confidence or too much severity!\r\n\r\n      Perhaps again, the husband failed to realize Honorine\u2019s girlish dreams?\r\n\r\n      Who can tell, while happy days last, what precepts he has neglected?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI remember only the broad outlines of the reproaches the Count addressed\r\n\r\n      to himself, with all the good faith of an anatomist seeking the cause of a\r\n\r\n      disease which might be overlooked by his brethren; but his merciful\r\n\r\n      indulgence struck me then as really worthy of that of Jesus Christ when He\r\n\r\n      rescued the woman taken in adultery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It was eighteen months after my father\u2019s death\u2014my mother followed\r\n\r\n      him to the tomb in a few months\u2014when the fearful night came which\r\n\r\n      surprised me by Honorine\u2019s farewell letter. What poetic delusion had\r\n\r\n      seduced my wife? Was it through her senses? Was it the magnetism of\r\n\r\n      misfortune or of genius? Which of these powers had taken her by storm or\r\n\r\n      misled her?\u2014I would not know. The blow was so terrible, that for a\r\n\r\n      month I remained stunned. Afterwards, reflection counseled me to continue\r\n\r\n      in ignorance, and Honorine\u2019s misfortunes have since taught me too much\r\n\r\n      about all these things.\u2014So far, Maurice, the story is commonplace\r\n\r\n      enough; but one word will change it all: I love Honorine, I have never\r\n\r\n      ceased to worship her. From the day when she left me I have lived on\r\n\r\n      memory; one by one I recall the pleasures for which Honorine no doubt had\r\n\r\n      no taste.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Oh!\u2019 said he, seeing the amazement in my eyes, \u2018do not make a hero of\r\n\r\n      me, do not think me such a fool, as the Colonel of the Empire would say,\r\n\r\n      as to have sought no diversion. Alas, my boy! I was either too young or\r\n\r\n      too much in love; I have not in the whole world met with another woman.\r\n\r\n      After frightful struggles with myself, I tried to forget; money in hand, I\r\n\r\n      stood on the very threshold of infidelity, but there the memory of\r\n\r\n      Honorine rose before me like a white statue. As I recalled the infinite\r\n\r\n      delicacy of that exquisite skin, through which the blood might be seen\r\n\r\n      coursing and the nerves quivering; as I saw in fancy that ingenuous face,\r\n\r\n      as guileless on the eve of my sorrows as on the day when I said to her,\r\n\r\n      \u201cShall we marry?\u201d as I remembered a heavenly fragrance, the very odor of\r\n\r\n      virtue, and the light in her eyes, the prettiness of her movements, I fled\r\n\r\n      like a man preparing to violate a tomb, who sees emerging from it the\r\n\r\n      transfigured soul of the dead. At consultations, in Court, by night, I\r\n\r\n      dream so incessantly of Honorine that only by excessive strength of mind\r\n\r\n      do I succeed in attending to what I am doing and saying. This is the\r\n\r\n      secret of my labors.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, I felt no more anger with her than a father can feel on seeing his\r\n\r\n      beloved child in some danger it has imprudently rushed into. I understood\r\n\r\n      that I had made a poem of my wife\u2014a poem I delighted in with such\r\n\r\n      intoxication, that I fancied she shared the intoxication. Ah! Maurice, an\r\n\r\n      indiscriminating passion in a husband is a mistake that may lead to any\r\n\r\n      crime in a wife. I had no doubt left all the faculties of this child,\r\n\r\n      loved as a child, entirely unemployed; I had perhaps wearied her with my\r\n\r\n      love before the hour of loving had struck for her! Too young to understand\r\n\r\n      that in the constancy of the wife lies the germ of the mother\u2019s devotion,\r\n\r\n      she mistook this first test of marriage for life itself, and the\r\n\r\n      refractory child cursed life, unknown to me, nor daring to complain to me,\r\n\r\n      out of sheer modesty perhaps! In so cruel a position she would be\r\n\r\n      defenceless against any man who stirred her deeply.\u2014And I, so wise a\r\n\r\n      judge as they say\u2014I, who have a kind heart, but whose mind was\r\n\r\n      absorbed\u2014I understood too late these unwritten laws of the woman\u2019s\r\n\r\n      code, I read them by the light of the fire that wrecked my roof. Then I\r\n\r\n      constituted my heart a tribunal by virtue of the law, for the law makes\r\n\r\n      the husband a judge: I acquitted my wife, and I condemned myself. But love\r\n\r\n      took possession of me as a passion, the mean, despotic passion which comes\r\n\r\n      over some old men. At this day I love the absent Honorine as a man of\r\n\r\n      sixty loves a woman whom he must possess at any cost, and yet I feel the\r\n\r\n      strength of a young man. I have the insolence of the old man and the\r\n\r\n      reserve of a boy.\u2014My dear fellow, society only laughs at such a\r\n\r\n      desperate conjugal predicament. Where it pities a lover, it regards a\r\n\r\n      husband as ridiculously inept; it makes sport of those who cannot keep the\r\n\r\n      woman they have secured under the canopy of the Church, and before the\r\n\r\n      Maire\u2019s scarf of office. And I had to keep silence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Serizy is happy. His indulgence allows him to see his wife; he can\r\n\r\n      protect and defend her; and, as he adores her, he knows all the perfect\r\n\r\n      joys of a benefactor whom nothing can disturb, not even ridicule, for he\r\n\r\n      pours it himself on his fatherly pleasures. \u201cI remain married only for my\r\n\r\n      wife\u2019s sake,\u201d he said to me one day on coming out of court.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But I\u2014I have nothing; I have not even to face ridicule, I who live\r\n\r\n      solely on a love which is starving! I who can never find a word to say to\r\n\r\n      a woman of the world! I who loathe prostitution! I who am faithful under a\r\n\r\n      spell!\u2014But for my religious faith, I should have killed myself. I\r\n\r\n      have defied the gulf of hard work; I have thrown myself into it, and come\r\n\r\n      out again alive, fevered, burning, bereft of sleep!\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI cannot remember all the words of this eloquent man, to whom passion\r\n\r\n      gave an eloquence indeed so far above that of the pleader that, as I\r\n\r\n      listened to him, I, like him, felt my cheeks wet with tears. You may\r\n\r\n      conceive of my feelings when, after a pause, during which we dried them\r\n\r\n      away, he finished his story with this revelation:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018This is the drama of my soul, but it is not the actual living drama\r\n\r\n      which is at this moment being acted in Paris! The interior drama interests\r\n\r\n      nobody. I know it; and you will one day admit that it is so, you, who at\r\n\r\n      this moment shed tears with me; no one can burden his heart or his skin\r\n\r\n      with another\u2019s pain. The measure of our sufferings is in ourselves.\u2014You\r\n\r\n      even understand my sorrows only by very vague analogy. Could you see me\r\n\r\n      calming the most violent frenzy of despair by the contemplation of a\r\n\r\n      miniature in which I can see and kiss her brow, the smile on her lips, the\r\n\r\n      shape of her face, can breathe the whiteness of her skin; which enables me\r\n\r\n      almost to feel, to play with the black masses of her curling hair?\u2014Could\r\n\r\n      you see me when I leap with hope\u2014when I writhe under the myriad\r\n\r\n      darts of despair\u2014when I tramp through the mire of Paris to quell my\r\n\r\n      irritation by fatigue? I have fits of collapse comparable to those of a\r\n\r\n      consumptive patient, moods of wild hilarity, terrors as of a murderer who\r\n\r\n      meets a sergeant of police. In short, my life is a continual paroxysm of\r\n\r\n      fears, joy, and dejection.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018As to the drama\u2014it is this. You imagine that I am occupied with\r\n\r\n      the Council of State, the Chamber, the Courts, Politics.\u2014Why, dear\r\n\r\n      me, seven hours at night are enough for all that, so much are my faculties\r\n\r\n      overwrought by the life I lead! Honorine is my real concern. To recover my\r\n\r\n      wife is my only study; to guard her in her cage, without her suspecting\r\n\r\n      that she is in my power; to satisfy her needs, to supply the little\r\n\r\n      pleasure she allows herself, to be always about her like a sylph without\r\n\r\n      allowing her to see or to suspect me, for if she did, the future would be\r\n\r\n      lost,\u2014that is my life, my true life.\u2014For seven years I have\r\n\r\n      never gone to bed without going first to see the light of her night-lamp,\r\n\r\n      or her shadow on the window curtains.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018She left my house, choosing to take nothing but the dress she wore that\r\n\r\n      day. The child carried her magnanimity to the point of folly!\r\n\r\n      Consequently, eighteen months after her flight she was deserted by her\r\n\r\n      lover, who was appalled by the cold, cruel, sinister, and revolting aspect\r\n\r\n      of poverty\u2014the coward! The man had, no doubt, counted on the easy\r\n\r\n      and luxurious life in Switzerland or Italy which fine ladies indulge in\r\n\r\n      when they leave their husbands. Honorine has sixty thousand francs a year\r\n\r\n      of her own. The wretch left the dear creature expecting an infant, and\r\n\r\n      without a penny. In the month of November 1820 I found means to persuade\r\n\r\n      the best accoucheur in Paris to play the part of a humble suburban\r\n\r\n      apothecary. I induced the priest of the parish in which the Countess was\r\n\r\n      living to supply her needs as though he were performing an act of charity.\r\n\r\n      Then to hide my wife, to secure her against discovery, to find her a\r\n\r\n      housekeeper who would be devoted to me and be my intelligent confidante\u2014it\r\n\r\n      was a task worthy of Figaro! You may suppose that to discover where my\r\n\r\n      wife had taken refuge I had only to make up my mind to it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018After three months of desperation rather than despair, the idea of\r\n\r\n      devoting myself to Honorine with God only in my secret, was one of those\r\n\r\n      poems which occur only to the heart of a lover through life and death!\r\n\r\n      Love must have its daily food. And ought I not to protect this child,\r\n\r\n      whose guilt was the outcome of my imprudence, against fresh disaster\u2014to\r\n\r\n      fulfil my part, in short, as a guardian angel?\u2014At the age of seven\r\n\r\n      months her infant died, happily for her and for me. For nine months more\r\n\r\n      my wife lay between life and death, deserted at the time when she most\r\n\r\n      needed a manly arm; but this arm,\u2019 said he, holding out his own with a\r\n\r\n      gesture of angelic dignity, \u2018was extended over her head. Honorine was\r\n\r\n      nursed as she would have been in her own home. When, on her recovery, she\r\n\r\n      asked how and by whom she had been assisted, she was told\u2014\u201cBy the\r\n\r\n      Sisters of Charity in the neighborhood\u2014by the Maternity Society\u2014by\r\n\r\n      the parish priest, who took an interest in her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018This woman, whose pride amounts to a vice, has shown a power of\r\n\r\n      resistance in misfortune, which on some evenings I call the obstinacy of a\r\n\r\n      mule. Honorine was bent on earning her living. My wife works! For five\r\n\r\n      years past I have lodged her in the Rue Saint-Maur, in a charming little\r\n\r\n      house, where she makes artificial flowers and articles of fashion. She\r\n\r\n      believes that she sells the product of her elegant fancywork to a shop,\r\n\r\n      where she is so well paid that she makes twenty francs a day, and in these\r\n\r\n      six years she had never had a moment\u2019s suspicion. She pays for everything\r\n\r\n      she needs at about the third of its value, so that on six thousand francs\r\n\r\n      a year she lives as if she had fifteen thousand. She is devoted to\r\n\r\n      flowers, and pays a hundred crowns to a gardener, who costs me twelve\r\n\r\n      hundred in wages, and sends me in a bill for two thousand francs every\r\n\r\n      three months. I have promised the man a market-garden with a house on it\r\n\r\n      close to the porter\u2019s lodge in the Rue Saint-Maur. I hold this ground in\r\n\r\n      the name of a clerk of the law courts. The smallest indiscretion would\r\n\r\n      ruin the gardener\u2019s prospects. Honorine has her little house, a garden,\r\n\r\n      and a splendid hothouse, for a rent of five hundred francs a year. There\r\n\r\n      she lives under the name of her housekeeper, Madame Gobain, the old woman\r\n\r\n      of impeccable discretion whom I was so lucky as to find, and whose\r\n\r\n      affection Honorine has won. But her zeal, like that of the gardener, is\r\n\r\n      kept hot by the promise of reward at the moment of success. The porter and\r\n\r\n      his wife cost me dreadfully dear for the same reasons. However, for three\r\n\r\n      years Honorine has been happy, believing that she owes to her own toil all\r\n\r\n      the luxury of flowers, dress, and comfort.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Oh! I know what you are about to say,\u2019 cried the Count, seeing a\r\n\r\n      question in my eyes and on my lips. \u2018Yes, yes; I have made the attempt. My\r\n\r\n      wife was formerly living in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. One day when, from\r\n\r\n      what Gobain told me, I believed in some chance of a reconciliation, I\r\n\r\n      wrote by post a letter, in which I tried to propitiate my wife\u2014a\r\n\r\n      letter written and re-written twenty times! I will not describe my\r\n\r\n      agonies. I went from the Rue Payenne to the Rue de Reuilly like a\r\n\r\n      condemned wretch going from the Palais de Justice to his execution, but he\r\n\r\n      goes on a cart, and I was on foot. It was dark\u2014there was a fog; I\r\n\r\n      went to meet Madame Gobain, who was to come and tell me what my wife had\r\n\r\n      done. Honorine, on recognizing my writing, had thrown the letter into the\r\n\r\n      fire without reading it.\u2014\u201cMadame Gobain,\u201d she had exclaimed, \u201cI\r\n\r\n      leave this to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What a dagger-stroke was this to a man who found inexhaustible pleasure\r\n\r\n      in the trickery by which he gets the finest Lyons velvet at twelve francs\r\n\r\n      a yard, a pheasant, a fish, a dish of fruit, for a tenth of their value,\r\n\r\n      for a woman so ignorant as to believe that she is paying ample wages with\r\n\r\n      two hundred and fifty francs to Madame Gobain, a cook fit for a bishop.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You have sometimes found me rubbing my hands in the enjoyment of a sort\r\n\r\n      of happiness. Well, I had just succeeded in some ruse worthy of the stage.\r\n\r\n      I had just deceived my wife\u2014I had sent her by a purchaser of\r\n\r\n      wardrobes an Indian shawl, to be offered to her as the property of an\r\n\r\n      actress who had hardly worn it, but in which I\u2014the solemn lawyer\r\n\r\n      whom you know\u2014had wrapped myself for a night! In short, my life at\r\n\r\n      this day may be summed up in the two words which express the extremes of\r\n\r\n      torment\u2014I love, and I wait! I have in Madame Gobain a faithful spy\r\n\r\n      on the heart I worship. I go every evening to chat with the old woman, to\r\n\r\n      hear from her all that Honorine has done during the day, the lightest word\r\n\r\n      she has spoken, for a single exclamation might betray to me the secrets of\r\n\r\n      that soul which is wilfully deaf and dumb. Honorine is pious; she attends\r\n\r\n      the Church services and prays, but she has never been to confession or\r\n\r\n      taken the Communion; she foresees what a priest would tell her. She will\r\n\r\n      not listen to the advice, to the injunction, that she should return to me.\r\n\r\n      This horror of me overwhelms me, dismays me, for I have never done her the\r\n\r\n      smallest harm. I have always been kind to her. Granting even that I may\r\n\r\n      have been a little hasty when teaching her, that my man\u2019s irony may have\r\n\r\n      hurt her legitimate girlish pride, is that a reason for persisting in a\r\n\r\n      determination which only the most implacable hatred could have inspired?\r\n\r\n      Honorine has never told Madame Gobain who she is; she keeps absolute\r\n\r\n      silence as to her marriage, so that the worthy and respectable woman can\r\n\r\n      never speak a word in my favor, for she is the only person in the house\r\n\r\n      who knows my secret. The others know nothing; they live under the awe\r\n\r\n      caused by the name of the Prefect of Police, and their respect for the\r\n\r\n      power of a Minister. Hence it is impossible for me to penetrate that\r\n\r\n      heart; the citadel is mine, but I cannot get into it. I have not a single\r\n\r\n      means of action. An act of violence would ruin me for ever.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018How can I argue against reasons of which I know nothing? Should I write\r\n\r\n      a letter, and have it copied by a public writer, and laid before Honorine?\r\n\r\n      But that would be to run the risk of a third removal. The last cost me\r\n\r\n      fifty thousand francs. The purchase was made in the first instance in the\r\n\r\n      name of the secretary whom you succeeded. The unhappy man, who did not\r\n\r\n      know how lightly I sleep, was detected by me in the act of opening a box\r\n\r\n      in which I had put the private agreement; I coughed, and he was seized\r\n\r\n      with a panic; next day I compelled him to sell the house to the man in\r\n\r\n      whose name it now stands, and I turned him out.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If it were not that I feel all my noblest faculties as a man satisfied,\r\n\r\n      happy, expansive; if the part I am playing were not that of divine\r\n\r\n      fatherhood; if I did not drink in delight by every pore, there are moments\r\n\r\n      when I should believe that I was a monomaniac. Sometimes at night I hear\r\n\r\n      the jingling bells of madness. I dread the violent transitions from a\r\n\r\n      feeble hope, which sometimes shines and flashes up, to complete despair,\r\n\r\n      falling as low as man can fall. A few days since I was seriously\r\n\r\n      considering the horrible end of the story of Lovelace and Clarissa\r\n\r\n      Harlowe, and saying to myself, if Honorine were the mother of a child of\r\n\r\n      mine, must she not necessarily return under her husband\u2019s roof?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And I have such complete faith in a happy future, that ten months ago I\r\n\r\n      bought and paid for one of the handsomest houses in the Faubourg\r\n\r\n      Saint-Honore. If I win back Honorine, I will not allow her to see this\r\n\r\n      house again, nor the room from which she fled. I mean to place my idol in\r\n\r\n      a new temple, where she may feel that life is altogether new. That house\r\n\r\n      is being made a marvel of elegance and taste. I have been told of a poet\r\n\r\n      who, being almost mad with love for an actress, bought the handsomest bed\r\n\r\n      in Paris without knowing how the actress would reward his passion. Well,\r\n\r\n      one of the coldest of lawyers, a man who is supposed to be the gravest\r\n\r\n      adviser of the Crown, was stirred to the depths of his heart by that\r\n\r\n      anecdote. The orator of the Legislative Chamber can understand the poet\r\n\r\n      who fed his ideal on material possibilities. Three days before the arrival\r\n\r\n      of Maria Louisa, Napoleon flung himself on his wedding bed at Compiegne.\r\n\r\n      All stupendous passions have the same impulses. I love as a poet\u2014as\r\n\r\n      an emperor!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs I heard the last words, I believed that Count Octave\u2019s fears were\r\n\r\n      realized; he had risen, and was walking up and down, and gesticulating,\r\n\r\n      but he stopped as if shocked by the vehemence of his own words.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I am very ridiculous,\u2019 he added, after a long pause, looking at me, as\r\n\r\n      if craving a glance of pity.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No, monsieur, you are very unhappy.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Ah yes!\u2019 said he, taking up the thread of his confidences. \u2018From the\r\n\r\n      violence of my speech you may, you must believe in the intensity of a\r\n\r\n      physical passion which for nine years has absorbed all my faculties; but\r\n\r\n      that is nothing in comparison with the worship I feel for the soul, the\r\n\r\n      mind, the heart, all in that woman; the enchanting divinities in the train\r\n\r\n      of Love, with whom we pass our life, and who form the daily poem of a\r\n\r\n      fugitive delight. By a phenomenon of retrospection I see now the graces of\r\n\r\n      Honorine\u2019s mind and heart, to which I paid little heed in the time of my\r\n\r\n      happiness\u2014like all who are happy. From day to day I have appreciated\r\n\r\n      the extent of my loss, discovering the exquisite gifts of that capricious\r\n\r\n      and refractory young creature who has grown so strong and so proud under\r\n\r\n      the heavy hand of poverty and the shock of the most cowardly desertion.\r\n\r\n      And that heavenly blossom is fading in solitude and hiding!\u2014Ah! The\r\n\r\n      law of which we were speaking,\u2019 he went on with bitter irony, \u2018the law is\r\n\r\n      a squad of gendarmes\u2014my wife seized and dragged away by force! Would\r\n\r\n      not that be to triumph over a corpse? Religion has no hold on her; she\r\n\r\n      craves its poetry, she prays, but she does not listen to the commandments\r\n\r\n      of the Church. I, for my part, have exhausted everything in the way of\r\n\r\n      mercy, of kindness, of love; I am at my wits\u2019 end. Only one chance of\r\n\r\n      victory is left to me; the cunning and patience with which bird-catchers\r\n\r\n      at last entrap the wariest birds, the swiftest, the most capricious, and\r\n\r\n      the rarest. Hence, Maurice, when M. de Grandville\u2019s indiscretion betrayed\r\n\r\n      to you the secret of my life, I ended by regarding this incident as one of\r\n\r\n      the decrees of fate, one of the utterances for which gamblers listen and\r\n\r\n      pray in the midst of their most impassioned play.... Have you enough\r\n\r\n      affection for me to show me romantic devotion?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I see what you are coming to, Monsieur le Comte,\u2019 said I, interrupting\r\n\r\n      him; \u2018I guess your purpose. Your first secretary tried to open your deed\r\n\r\n      box. I know the heart of your second\u2014he might fall in love with your\r\n\r\n      wife. And can you devote him to destruction by sending him into the fire?\r\n\r\n      Can any one put his hand into a brazier without burning it?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You are a foolish boy,\u2019 replied the Count. \u2018I will send you well gloved.\r\n\r\n      It is no secretary of mine that will be lodged in the Rue Saint-Maur in\r\n\r\n      the little garden-house which I have at his disposal. It is my distant\r\n\r\n      cousin, Baron de l\u2019Hostal, a lawyer high in office...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter a moment of silent surprise, I heard the gate bell ring, and a\r\n\r\n      carriage came into the courtyard. Presently the footman announced Madame\r\n\r\n      de Courteville and her daughter. The Count had a large family connection\r\n\r\n      on his mother\u2019s side. Madame de Courteville, his cousin, was the widow of\r\n\r\n      a judge on the bench of the Seine division, who had left her a daughter\r\n\r\n      and no fortune whatever. What could a woman of nine-and-twenty be in\r\n\r\n      comparison with a young girl of twenty, as lovely as imagination could\r\n\r\n      wish for an ideal mistress?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Baron, and Master of Appeals, till you get something better, and this\r\n\r\n      old house settled on her,\u2014would not you have enough good reasons for\r\n\r\n      not falling in love with the Countess?\u2019 he said to me in a whisper, as he\r\n\r\n      took me by the hand and introduced me to Madame de Courteville and her\r\n\r\n      daughter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was dazzled, not so much by these advantages of which I had never\r\n\r\n      dreamed, but by Amelie de Courteville, whose beauty was thrown into relief\r\n\r\n      by one of those well-chosen toilets which a mother can achieve for a\r\n\r\n      daughter when she wants to see her married.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I will not talk of myself,\u201d said the Consul after a pause.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThree weeks later I went to live in the gardener\u2019s cottage, which had\r\n\r\n      been cleaned, repaired, and furnished with the celerity which is explained\r\n\r\n      by three words: Paris; French workmen; money! I was as much in love as the\r\n\r\n      Count could possibly desire as a security. Would the prudence of a young\r\n\r\n      man of five-and-twenty be equal to the part I was undertaking, involving a\r\n\r\n      friend\u2019s happiness? To settle that matter, I may confess that I counted\r\n\r\n      very much on my uncle\u2019s advice; for I had been authorized by the Count to\r\n\r\n      take him into confidence in any case where I deemed his interference\r\n\r\n      necessary. I engaged a garden; I devoted myself to horticulture; I worked\r\n\r\n      frantically, like a man whom nothing can divert, turning up the soil of\r\n\r\n      the market-garden, and appropriating the ground to the culture of flowers.\r\n\r\n      Like the maniacs of England, or of Holland, I gave it out that I was\r\n\r\n      devoted to one kind of flower, and especially grew dahlias, collecting\r\n\r\n      every variety. You will understand that my conduct, even in the smallest\r\n\r\n      details, was laid down for me by the Count, whose whole intellectual\r\n\r\n      powers were directed to the most trifling incidents of the tragi-comedy\r\n\r\n      enacted in the Rue Saint-Maur. As soon as the Countess had gone to bed, at\r\n\r\n      about eleven at night, Octave, Madame Gobain, and I sat in council. I\r\n\r\n      heard the old woman\u2019s report to the Count of his wife\u2019s least proceedings\r\n\r\n      during the day. He inquired into everything: her meals, her occupations,\r\n\r\n      her frame of mind, her plans for the morrow, the flowers she proposed to\r\n\r\n      imitate. I understood what love in despair may be when it is the threefold\r\n\r\n      passion of the heart, the mind, and the senses. Octave lived only for that\r\n\r\n      hour.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDuring two months, while my work in the garden lasted, I never set eyes\r\n\r\n      on the little house where my fair neighbor dwelt. I had not even inquired\r\n\r\n      whether I had a neighbor, though the Countess\u2019 garden was divided from\r\n\r\n      mine by a paling, along which she had planted cypress trees already four\r\n\r\n      feet high. One fine morning Madame Gobain announced to her mistress, as a\r\n\r\n      disastrous piece of news, the intention, expressed by an eccentric\r\n\r\n      creature who had become her neighbor, of building a wall between the two\r\n\r\n      gardens, at the end of the year. I will say nothing of the curiosity which\r\n\r\n      consumed me to see the Countess! The wish almost extinguished my budding\r\n\r\n      love for Amelie de Courteville. My scheme for building a wall was indeed a\r\n\r\n      dangerous threat. There would be no more fresh air for Honorine, whose\r\n\r\n      garden would then be a sort of narrow alley shut in between my wall and\r\n\r\n      her own little house. This dwelling, formerly a summer villa, was like a\r\n\r\n      house of cards; it was not more than thirty feet deep, and about a hundred\r\n\r\n      feet long. The garden front, painted in the German fashion, imitated a\r\n\r\n      trellis with flowers up to the second floor, and was really a charming\r\n\r\n      example of the Pompadour style, so well called rococo. A long avenue of\r\n\r\n      limes led up to it. The gardens of the pavilion and my plot of ground were\r\n\r\n      in the shape of a hatchet, of which this avenue was the handle. My wall\r\n\r\n      would cut away three-quarters of the hatchet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Countess was in despair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018My good Gobain,\u2019 said she, \u2018what sort of man is this florist?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018On my word,\u2019 said the housekeeper, \u2018I do not know whether it will be\r\n\r\n      possible to tame him. He seems to have a horror of women. He is the nephew\r\n\r\n      of a Paris cure. I have seen the uncle but once; a fine old man of sixty,\r\n\r\n      very ugly, but very amiable. It is quite possible that this priest\r\n\r\n      encourages his nephew, as they say in the neighborhood, in his love of\r\n\r\n      flowers, that nothing worse may happen\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Why\u2014what?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, your neighbor is a little cracked!\u2019 said Gobain, tapping her head!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow a harmless lunatic is the only man whom no woman ever distrusts in\r\n\r\n      the matter of sentiment. You will see how wise the Count had been in\r\n\r\n      choosing this disguise for me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What ails him then?\u2019 asked the Countess.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He has studied too hard,\u2019 replied Gobain; \u2018he has turned misanthropic.\r\n\r\n      And he has his reasons for disliking women\u2014well, if you want to know\r\n\r\n      all that is said about him\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said Honorine, \u2018madmen frighten me less than sane folks; I will\r\n\r\n      speak to him myself! Tell him that I beg him to come here. If I do not\r\n\r\n      succeed, I will send for the cure.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe day after this conversation, as I was walking along my graveled path,\r\n\r\n      I caught sight of the half-opened curtains on the first floor of the\r\n\r\n      little house, and of a woman\u2019s face curiously peeping out. Madame Gobain\r\n\r\n      called me. I hastily glanced at the Countess\u2019 house, and by a rude shrug\r\n\r\n      expressed, \u2018What do I care for your mistress!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Madame,\u2019 said Gobain, called upon to give an account of her errand, \u2018the\r\n\r\n      madman bid me leave him in peace, saying that even a charcoal seller is\r\n\r\n      master in his own premises, especially when he has no wife.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He is perfectly right,\u2019 said the Countess.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Yes, but he ended by saying, \u201cI will go,\u201d when I told him that he would\r\n\r\n      greatly distress a lady living in retirement, who found her greatest\r\n\r\n      solace in growing flowers.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNext day a signal from Gobain informed me that I was expected. After the\r\n\r\n      Countess\u2019 breakfast, when she was walking to and fro in front of her\r\n\r\n      house, I broke out some palings and went towards her. I had dressed myself\r\n\r\n      like a countryman, in an old pair of gray flannel trousers, heavy wooden\r\n\r\n      shoes, and shabby shooting coat, a peaked cap on my head, a ragged bandana\r\n\r\n      round my neck, hands soiled with mould, and a dibble in my hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Madame,\u2019 said the housekeeper, \u2018this good man is your neighbor.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Countess was not alarmed. I saw at last the woman whom her own\r\n\r\n      conduct and her husband\u2019s confidences had made me so curious to meet. It\r\n\r\n      was in the early days of May. The air was pure, the weather serene; the\r\n\r\n      verdure of the first foliage, the fragrance of spring formed a setting for\r\n\r\n      this creature of sorrow. As I then saw Honorine I understood Octave\u2019s\r\n\r\n      passion and the truthfulness of his description, \u2018A heavenly flower!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHer pallor was what first struck me by its peculiar tone of white\u2014for\r\n\r\n      there are as many tones of white as of red or blue. On looking at the\r\n\r\n      Countess, the eye seemed to feel that tender skin, where the blood flowed\r\n\r\n      in the blue veins. At the slightest emotion the blood mounted under the\r\n\r\n      surface in rosy flushes like a cloud. When we met, the sunshine, filtering\r\n\r\n      through the light foliage of the acacias, shed on Honorine the pale gold,\r\n\r\n      ambient glory in which Raphael and Titian, alone of all painters, have\r\n\r\n      been able to enwrap the Virgin. Her brown eyes expressed both tenderness\r\n\r\n      and vivacity; their brightness seemed reflected in her face through the\r\n\r\n      long downcast lashes. Merely by lifting her delicate eyelids, Honorine\r\n\r\n      could cast a spell; there was so much feeling, dignity, terror, or\r\n\r\n      contempt in her way of raising or dropping those veils of the soul. She\r\n\r\n      could freeze or give life by a look. Her light-brown hair, carelessly\r\n\r\n      knotted on her head, outlined a poet\u2019s brow, high, powerful, and dreamy.\r\n\r\n      The mouth was wholly voluptuous. And to crown all by a grace, rare in\r\n\r\n      France, though common in Italy, all the lines and forms of the head had a\r\n\r\n      stamp of nobleness which would defy the outrages of time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThough slight, Honorine was not thin, and her figure struck me as being\r\n\r\n      one that might revive love when it believed itself exhausted. She\r\n\r\n      perfectly represented the idea conveyed by the word mignonne, for\r\n\r\n      she was one of those pliant little women who allow themselves to be taken\r\n\r\n      up, petted, set down, and taken up again like a kitten. Her small feet, as\r\n\r\n      I heard them on the gravel, made a light sound essentially their own, that\r\n\r\n      harmonized with the rustle of her dress, producing a feminine music which\r\n\r\n      stamped itself on the heart, and remained distinct from the footfall of a\r\n\r\n      thousand other women. Her gait bore all the quarterings of her race with\r\n\r\n      so much pride, that, in the street, the least respectful working man would\r\n\r\n      have made way for her. Gay and tender, haughty and imposing, it was\r\n\r\n      impossible to understand her, excepting as gifted with these apparently\r\n\r\n      incompatible qualities, which, nevertheless, had left her still a child.\r\n\r\n      But it was a child who might be as strong as an angel; and, like the\r\n\r\n      angel, once hurt in her nature, she would be implacable.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cColdness on that face must no doubt be death to those on whom her eyes\r\n\r\n      had smiled, for whom her set lips had parted, for those whose soul had\r\n\r\n      drunk in the melody of that voice, lending to her words the poetry of song\r\n\r\n      by its peculiar intonation. Inhaling the perfume of violets that\r\n\r\n      accompanied her, I understood how the memory of this wife had arrested the\r\n\r\n      Count on the threshold of debauchery, and how impossible it would be ever\r\n\r\n      to forget a creature who really was a flower to the touch, a flower to the\r\n\r\n      eye, a flower of fragrance, a heavenly flower to the soul.... Honorine\r\n\r\n      inspired devotion, chivalrous devotion, regardless of reward. A man on\r\n\r\n      seeing her must say to himself:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Think, and I will divine your thought; speak, and I will obey. If my\r\n\r\n      life, sacrificed in torments, can procure you one day\u2019s happiness, take my\r\n\r\n      life, I will smile like a martyr at the stake, for I shall offer that day\r\n\r\n      to God, as a token to which a father responds on recognizing a gift to his\r\n\r\n      child.\u2019 Many women study their expression, and succeed in producing\r\n\r\n      effects similar to those which would have struck you at first sight of the\r\n\r\n      Countess; only, in her, it was all the outcome of a delightful nature,\r\n\r\n      that inimitable nature went at once to the heart. If I tell you all this,\r\n\r\n      it is because her soul, her thoughts, the exquisiteness of her heart, are\r\n\r\n      all we are concerned with, and you would have blamed me if I had not\r\n\r\n      sketched them for you.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was very near forgetting my part as a half-crazy lout, clumsy, and by\r\n\r\n      no means chivalrous.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I am told, madame, that you are fond of flowers?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I am an artificial flower-maker,\u2019 said she. \u2018After growing flowers, I\r\n\r\n      imitate them, like a mother who is artist enough to have the pleasure of\r\n\r\n      painting her children.... That is enough to tell you that I am poor and\r\n\r\n      unable to pay for the concession I am anxious to obtain from you?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But how,\u2019 said I, as grave as a judge, \u2018can a lady of such rank as yours\r\n\r\n      would seem to be, ply so humble a calling? Have you, like me, good reasons\r\n\r\n      for employing your fingers so as to keep your brains from working?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Let us stick to the question of the wall,\u2019 said she, with a smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Why, we have begun at the foundations,\u2019 said I. \u2018Must not I know which\r\n\r\n      of us ought to yield to the other in behalf of our suffering, or, if you\r\n\r\n      choose, of our mania?\u2014Oh! what a charming clump of narcissus! They\r\n\r\n      are as fresh as this spring morning!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI assure you, she had made for herself a perfect museum of flowers and\r\n\r\n      shrubs, which none might see but the sun, and of which the arrangement had\r\n\r\n      been prompted by the genius of an artist; the most heartless of landlords\r\n\r\n      must have treated it with respect. The masses of plants, arranged\r\n\r\n      according to their height, or in single clumps, were really a joy to the\r\n\r\n      soul. This retired and solitary garden breathed comforting scents, and\r\n\r\n      suggested none but sweet thoughts and graceful, nay, voluptuous pictures.\r\n\r\n      On it was set that inscrutable sign-manual, which our true character\r\n\r\n      stamps on everything, as soon as nothing compels us to obey the various\r\n\r\n      hypocrisies, necessary as they are, which Society insists on. I looked\r\n\r\n      alternately at the mass of narcissus and at the Countess, affecting to be\r\n\r\n      far more in love with the flowers than with her, to carry out my part.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018So you are very fond of flowers?\u2019 said she.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018They are,\u2019 I replied, \u2018the only beings that never disappoint our cares\r\n\r\n      and affection.\u2019 And I went on to deliver such a diatribe while comparing\r\n\r\n      botany and the world, that we ended miles away from the dividing wall, and\r\n\r\n      the Countess must have supposed me to be a wretched and wounded sufferer\r\n\r\n      worthy of her pity. However, at the end of half an hour my neighbor\r\n\r\n      naturally brought me back to the point; for women, when they are not in\r\n\r\n      love, have all the cold blood of an experienced attorney.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If you insist on my leaving the paling,\u2019 said I, \u2018you will learn all the\r\n\r\n      secrets of gardening that I want to hide; I am seeking to grow a blue\r\n\r\n      dahlia, a blue rose; I am crazy for blue flowers. Is not blue the favorite\r\n\r\n      color of superior souls? We are neither of us really at home; we might as\r\n\r\n      well make a little door of open railings to unite our gardens.... You,\r\n\r\n      too, are fond of flowers; you will see mine, I shall see yours. If you\r\n\r\n      receive no visitors at all, I, for my part, have none but my uncle, the\r\n\r\n      Cure of the White Friars.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said she, \u2018I will give you the right to come into my garden, my\r\n\r\n      premises at any hour. Come and welcome; you will always be admitted as a\r\n\r\n      neighbor with whom I hope to keep on good terms. But I like my solitude\r\n\r\n      too well to burden it with any loss of independence.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018As you please,\u2019 said I, and with one leap I was over the paling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Now, of what use would a door be?\u2019 said I, from my own domain, turning\r\n\r\n      round to the Countess, and mocking her with a madman\u2019s gesture and\r\n\r\n      grimace.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor a fortnight I seemed to take no heed of my neighbor. Towards the end\r\n\r\n      of May, one lovely evening, we happened both to be out on opposite sides\r\n\r\n      of the paling, both walking slowly. Having reached the end, we could not\r\n\r\n      help exchanging a few civil words; she found me in such deep dejection,\r\n\r\n      lost in such painful meditations, that she spoke to me of hopefulness, in\r\n\r\n      brief sentences that sounded like the songs with which nurses lull their\r\n\r\n      babies. I then leaped the fence, and found myself for the second time at\r\n\r\n      her side. The Countess led me into the house, wishing to subdue my\r\n\r\n      sadness. So at last I had penetrated the sanctuary where everything was in\r\n\r\n      harmony with the woman I have tried to describe to you.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExquisite simplicity reigned there. The interior of the little house was\r\n\r\n      just such a dainty box as the art of the eighteenth century devised for\r\n\r\n      the pretty profligacy of a fine gentleman. The dining-room, on the ground\r\n\r\n      floor, was painted in fresco, with garlands of flowers, admirably and\r\n\r\n      marvelously executed. The staircase was charmingly decorated in\r\n\r\n      monochrome. The little drawing-room, opposite the dining-room, was very\r\n\r\n      much faded; but the Countess had hung it with panels of tapestry of\r\n\r\n      fanciful designs, taken off old screens. A bath-room came next. Upstairs\r\n\r\n      there was but one bedroom, with a dressing-room, and a library which she\r\n\r\n      used as her workroom. The kitchen was beneath in the basement on which the\r\n\r\n      house was raised, for there was a flight of several steps outside. The\r\n\r\n      balustrade of a balcony in garlands a la Pompadour concealed the roof;\r\n\r\n      only the lead cornices were visible. In this retreat one was a hundred\r\n\r\n      leagues from Paris.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut for the bitter smile which occasionally played on the beautiful red\r\n\r\n      lips of this pale woman, it would have been possible to believe that this\r\n\r\n      violet buried in her thicket of flowers was happy. In a few days we had\r\n\r\n      reached a certain degree of intimacy, the result of our close neighborhood\r\n\r\n      and of the Countess\u2019 conviction that I was indifferent to women. A look\r\n\r\n      would have spoilt all, and I never allowed a thought of her to be seen in\r\n\r\n      my eyes. Honorine chose to regard me as an old friend. Her manner to me\r\n\r\n      was the outcome of a kind of pity. Her looks, her voice, her words, all\r\n\r\n      showed that she was a hundred miles away from the coquettish airs which\r\n\r\n      the strictest virtue might have allowed under such circumstances. She soon\r\n\r\n      gave me the right to go into the pretty workshop where she made her\r\n\r\n      flowers, a retreat full of books and curiosities, as smart as a boudoir\r\n\r\n      where elegance emphasized the vulgarity of the tools of her trade. The\r\n\r\n      Countess had in the course of time poetized, as I may say, a thing which\r\n\r\n      is at the antipodes to poetry\u2014a manufacture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps of all the work a woman can do, the making of artificial flowers\r\n\r\n      is that of which the details allow her to display most grace. For coloring\r\n\r\n      prints she must sit bent over a table and devote herself, with some\r\n\r\n      attention, to this half painting. Embroidering tapestry, as diligently as\r\n\r\n      a woman must who is to earn her living by it, entails consumption or\r\n\r\n      curvature of the spine. Engraving music is one of the most laborious, by\r\n\r\n      the care, the minute exactitude, and the intelligence it demands. Sewing\r\n\r\n      and white embroidery do not earn thirty sous a day. But the making of\r\n\r\n      flowers and light articles of wear necessitates a variety of movements,\r\n\r\n      gestures, ideas even, which do not take a pretty woman out of her sphere;\r\n\r\n      she is still herself; she may chat, laugh, sing, or think.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was certainly a feeling for art in the way in which the Countess\r\n\r\n      arranged on a long deal table the myriad-colored petals which were used in\r\n\r\n      composing the flowers she was to produce. The saucers of color were of\r\n\r\n      white china, and always clean, arranged in such order that the eye could\r\n\r\n      at once see the required shade in the scale of tints. Thus the\r\n\r\n      aristocratic artist saved time. A pretty little cabinet with a hundred\r\n\r\n      tiny drawers, of ebony inlaid with ivory, contained the little steel\r\n\r\n      moulds in which she shaped the leaves and some forms of petals. A fine\r\n\r\n      Japanese bowl held the paste, which was never allowed to turn sour, and it\r\n\r\n      had a fitted cover with a hinge so easy that she could lift it with a\r\n\r\n      finger-tip. The wire, of iron and brass, lurked in a little drawer of the\r\n\r\n      table before her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cUnder her eyes, in a Venetian glass, shaped like a flower-cup on its\r\n\r\n      stem, was the living model she strove to imitate. She had a passion for\r\n\r\n      achievement; she attempted the most difficult things, close racemes, the\r\n\r\n      tiniest corollas, heaths, nectaries of the most variegated hues. Her\r\n\r\n      hands, as swift as her thoughts, went from the table to the flower she was\r\n\r\n      making, as those of an accomplished pianist fly over the keys. Her fingers\r\n\r\n      seemed to be fairies, to use Perrault\u2019s expression, so infinite were the\r\n\r\n      different actions of twisting, fitting, and pressure needed for the work,\r\n\r\n      all hidden under grace of movement, while she adapted each motion to the\r\n\r\n      result with the lucidity of instinct.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI could not tire of admiring her as she shaped a flower from the\r\n\r\n      materials sorted before her, padding the wire stem and adjusting the\r\n\r\n      leaves. She displayed the genius of a painter in her bold attempts; she\r\n\r\n      copied faded flowers and yellowing leaves; she struggled even with\r\n\r\n      wildflowers, the most artless of all, and the most elaborate in their\r\n\r\n      simplicity.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018This art,\u2019 she would say, \u2018is in its infancy. If the women of Paris had\r\n\r\n      a little of the genius which the slavery of the harem brings out in\r\n\r\n      Oriental women, they would lend a complete language of flowers to the\r\n\r\n      wreaths they wear on their head. To please my own taste as an artist I\r\n\r\n      have made drooping flowers with leaves of the hue of Florentine bronze,\r\n\r\n      such as are found before or after the winter. Would not such a crown on\r\n\r\n      the head of a young woman whose life is a failure have a certain poetical\r\n\r\n      fitness? How many things a woman might express by her head-dress! Are\r\n\r\n      there not flowers for drunken Bacchantes, flowers for gloomy and stern\r\n\r\n      bigots, pensive flowers for women who are bored? Botany, I believe, may be\r\n\r\n      made to express every sensation and thought of the soul, even the most\r\n\r\n      subtle.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe would employ me to stamp out the leaves, cut up material, and prepare\r\n\r\n      wires for the stems. My affected desire for occupation made me soon\r\n\r\n      skilful. We talked as we worked. When I had nothing to do, I read new\r\n\r\n      books to her, for I had my part to keep up as a man weary of life, worn\r\n\r\n      out with griefs, gloomy, sceptical, and soured. My person led to adorable\r\n\r\n      banter as to my purely physical resemblance\u2014with the exception of\r\n\r\n      his club foot\u2014to Lord Byron. It was tacitly acknowledged that her\r\n\r\n      own troubles, as to which she kept the most profound silence, far\r\n\r\n      outweighed mine, though the causes I assigned for my misanthropy might\r\n\r\n      have satisfied Young or Job.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will say nothing of the feelings of shame which tormented me as I\r\n\r\n      inflicted on my heart, like the beggars in the street, false wounds to\r\n\r\n      excite the compassion of that enchanting woman. I soon appreciated the\r\n\r\n      extent of my devotedness by learning to estimate the baseness of a spy.\r\n\r\n      The expressions of sympathy bestowed on me would have comforted the\r\n\r\n      greatest grief. This charming creature, weaned from the world, and for so\r\n\r\n      many years alone, having, besides love, treasures of kindliness to bestow,\r\n\r\n      offered these to me with childlike effusiveness and such compassion as\r\n\r\n      would inevitably have filled with bitterness any profligate who should\r\n\r\n      have fallen in love with her; for, alas, it was all charity, all sheer\r\n\r\n      pity. Her renunciation of love, her dread of what is called happiness for\r\n\r\n      women, she proclaimed with equal vehemence and candor. These happy days\r\n\r\n      proved to me that a woman\u2019s friendship is far superior to her love.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI suffered the revelations of my sorrows to be dragged from me with as\r\n\r\n      many grimaces as a young lady allows herself before sitting down to the\r\n\r\n      piano, so conscious are they of the annoyance that will follow. As you may\r\n\r\n      imagine, the necessity for overcoming my dislike to speak had induced the\r\n\r\n      Countess to strengthen the bonds of our intimacy; but she found in me so\r\n\r\n      exact a counterpart of her own antipathy to love, that I fancied she was\r\n\r\n      well content with the chance which had brought to her desert island a sort\r\n\r\n      of Man Friday. Solitude was perhaps beginning to weigh on her. At the same\r\n\r\n      time, there was nothing of the coquette in her; nothing survived of the\r\n\r\n      woman; she did not feel that she had a heart, she told me, excepting in\r\n\r\n      the ideal world where she found refuge. I involuntarily compared these two\r\n\r\n      lives\u2014hers and the Count\u2019s:\u2014his, all activity, agitation, and\r\n\r\n      emotion; hers, all inaction, quiescence, and stagnation. The woman and the\r\n\r\n      man were admirably obedient to their nature. My misanthropy allowed me to\r\n\r\n      utter cynical sallies against men and women both, and I indulged in them,\r\n\r\n      hoping to bring Honorine to the confidential point; but she was not to be\r\n\r\n      caught in any trap, and I began to understand that mulish obstinacy which\r\n\r\n      is commoner among women than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The Orientals are right,\u2019 I said to her one evening, \u2018when they shut you\r\n\r\n      up and regard you merely as the playthings of their pleasure. Europe has\r\n\r\n      been well punished for having admitted you to form an element of society\r\n\r\n      and for accepting you on an equal footing. In my opinion, woman is the\r\n\r\n      most dishonorable and cowardly being to be found. Nay, and that is where\r\n\r\n      her charm lies. Where would be the pleasure of hunting a tame thing? When\r\n\r\n      once a woman has inspired a man\u2019s passion, she is to him for ever sacred;\r\n\r\n      in his eyes she is hedged round by an imprescriptible prerogative. In men\r\n\r\n      gratitude for past delights is eternal. Though he should find his mistress\r\n\r\n      grown old or unworthy, the woman still has rights over his heart; but to\r\n\r\n      you women the man you have loved is as nothing to you; nay, more, he is\r\n\r\n      unpardonable in one thing\u2014he lives on! You dare not own it, but you\r\n\r\n      all have in your hearts the feeling which that popular calumny called\r\n\r\n      tradition ascribes to the Lady of the Tour de Nesle: \u201cWhat a pity it is\r\n\r\n      that we cannot live on love as we live on fruit, and that when we have had\r\n\r\n      our fill, nothing should survive but the remembrance of pleasure!\u201d\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018God has, no doubt, reserved such perfect bliss for Paradise,\u2019 said she.\r\n\r\n      \u2018But,\u2019 she added, \u2018if your argument seems to you very witty, to me it has\r\n\r\n      the disadvantage of being false. What can those women be who give\r\n\r\n      themselves up to a succession of loves?\u2019 she asked, looking at me as the\r\n\r\n      Virgin in Ingres\u2019 picture looks at Louis XIII. offering her his kingdom.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You are an actress in good faith,\u2019 said I, \u2018for you gave me a look just\r\n\r\n      now which would make the fame of an actress. Still, lovely as you are, you\r\n\r\n      have loved; ergo, you forget.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I!\u2019 she exclaimed, evading my question, \u2018I am not a woman. I am a nun,\r\n\r\n      and seventy-two years old!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Then, how can you so positively assert that you feel more keenly than I?\r\n\r\n      Sorrow has but one form for women. The only misfortunes they regard are\r\n\r\n      disappointments of the heart.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe looked at me sweetly, and, like all women when stuck between the\r\n\r\n      issues of a dilemma, or held in the clutches of truth, she persisted,\r\n\r\n      nevertheless, in her wilfulness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I am a nun,\u2019 she said, \u2018and you talk to me of the world where I shall\r\n\r\n      never again set foot.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Not even in thought?\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Is the world so much to be desired?\u2019 she replied. \u2018Oh! when my mind\r\n\r\n      wanders, it goes higher. The angel of perfection, the beautiful angel\r\n\r\n      Gabriel, often sings in my heart. If I were rich, I should work, all the\r\n\r\n      same, to keep me from soaring too often on the many-tinted wings of the\r\n\r\n      angel, and wandering in the world of fancy. There are meditations which\r\n\r\n      are the ruin of us women! I owe much peace of mind to my flowers, though\r\n\r\n      sometimes they fail to occupy me. On some days I find my soul invaded by a\r\n\r\n      purposeless expectancy; I cannot banish some idea which takes possession\r\n\r\n      of me, which seems to make my fingers clumsy. I feel that some great event\r\n\r\n      is impending, that my life is about to change; I listen vaguely, I stare\r\n\r\n      into the darkness, I have no liking for my work, and after a thousand\r\n\r\n      fatigues I find life once more\u2014everyday life. Is this a warning from\r\n\r\n      heaven? I ask myself\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter three months of this struggle between two diplomates, concealed\r\n\r\n      under the semblance of youthful melancholy, and a woman whose disgust of\r\n\r\n      life made her invulnerable, I told the Count that it was impossible to\r\n\r\n      drag this tortoise out of her shell; it must be broken. The evening\r\n\r\n      before, in our last quite friendly discussion, the Countess had exclaimed:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Lucretia\u2019s dagger wrote in letters of blood the watchword of woman\u2019s\r\n\r\n      charter: Liberty!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrom that moment the Count left me free to act.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I have been paid a hundred francs for the flowers and caps I made this\r\n\r\n      week!\u2019 Honorine exclaimed gleefully one Saturday evening when I went to\r\n\r\n      visit her in the little sitting-room on the ground floor, which the\r\n\r\n      unavowed proprietor had had regilt.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was ten o\u2019clock. The twilight of July and a glorious moon lent us\r\n\r\n      their misty light. Gusts of mingled perfumes soothed the soul; the\r\n\r\n      Countess was clinking in her hand the five gold pieces given to her by a\r\n\r\n      supposititious dealer in fashionable frippery, another of Octave\u2019s\r\n\r\n      accomplices found for him by a judge, M. Popinot.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I earn my living by amusing myself,\u2019 said she; \u2018I am free, when men,\r\n\r\n      armed with their laws, have tried to make us slaves. Oh, I have transports\r\n\r\n      of pride every Saturday! In short, I like M. Gaudissart\u2019s gold pieces as\r\n\r\n      much as Lord Byron, your double, liked Mr. Murray\u2019s.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018This is not becoming in a woman,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Pooh! Am I a woman? I am a boy gifted with a soft soul, that is all; a\r\n\r\n      boy whom no woman can torture\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Your life is the negation of your whole being,\u2019 I replied. \u2018What? You,\r\n\r\n      on whom God has lavished His choicest treasures of love and beauty, do you\r\n\r\n      never wish\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018For what?\u2019 said she, somewhat disturbed by a speech which, for the first\r\n\r\n      time, gave the lie to the part I had assumed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018For a pretty little child, with curling hair, running, playing among the\r\n\r\n      flowers, like a flower itself of life and love, and calling you mother!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI waited for an answer. A too prolonged silence led me to perceive the\r\n\r\n      terrible effect of my words, though the darkness at first concealed it.\r\n\r\n      Leaning on her sofa, the Countess had not indeed fainted, but frozen under\r\n\r\n      a nervous attack of which the first chill, as gentle as everything that\r\n\r\n      was part of her, felt, as she afterwards said, like the influence of a\r\n\r\n      most insidious poison. I called Madame Gobain, who came and led away her\r\n\r\n      mistress, laid her on her bed, unlaced her, undressed her, and restored\r\n\r\n      her, not to life, it is true, but to the consciousness of some dreadful\r\n\r\n      suffering. I meanwhile walked up and down the path behind the house,\r\n\r\n      weeping, and doubting my success. I only wished to give up this part of\r\n\r\n      the bird-catcher which I had so rashly assumed. Madame Gobain, who came\r\n\r\n      down and found me with my face wet with tears, hastily went up again to\r\n\r\n      say to the Countess:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What has happened, madame? Monsieur Maurice is crying like a child.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRoused to action by the evil interpretation that might be put on our\r\n\r\n      mutual behavior, she summoned superhuman strength to put on a wrapper and\r\n\r\n      come down to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You are not the cause of this attack,\u2019 said she. \u2018I am subject to these\r\n\r\n      spasms, a sort of cramp of the heart\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And will you not tell me of your troubles?\u2019 said I, in a voice which\r\n\r\n      cannot be affected, as I wiped away my tears. \u2018Have you not just now told\r\n\r\n      me that you have been a mother, and have been so unhappy as to lose your\r\n\r\n      child?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Marie!\u2019 she called as she rang the bell. Gobain came in.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Bring lights and some tea,\u2019 said she, with the calm decision of a Mylady\r\n\r\n      clothed in the armor of pride by the dreadful English training which you\r\n\r\n      know too well.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen the housekeeper had lighted the tapers and closed the shutters, the\r\n\r\n      Countess showed me a mute countenance; her indomitable pride and gravity,\r\n\r\n      worthy of a savage, had already reasserted their mastery. She said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Do you know why I like Lord Byron so much? It is because he suffered as\r\n\r\n      animals do. Of what use are complaints when they are not an elegy like\r\n\r\n      Manfred\u2019s, nor bitter mockery like Don Juan\u2019s, nor a reverie like Childe\r\n\r\n      Harold\u2019s? Nothing shall be known of me. My heart is a poem that I lay\r\n\r\n      before God.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If I chose\u2014\u2014\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If?\u2019 she repeated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I have no interest in anything,\u2019 I replied, \u2018so I cannot be inquisitive;\r\n\r\n      but, if I chose, I could know all your secrets by to-morrow.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I defy you!\u2019 she exclaimed, with ill-disguised uneasiness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Seriously?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Certainly,\u2019 said she, tossing her head. \u2018If such a crime is possible, I\r\n\r\n      ought to know it.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In the first place, madame,\u2019 I went on, pointing to her hands, \u2018those\r\n\r\n      pretty fingers, which are enough to show that you are not a mere girl\u2014were\r\n\r\n      they made for toil? Then you call yourself Madame Gobain, you, who, in my\r\n\r\n      presence the other day on receiving a letter, said to Marie: \u201cHere, this\r\n\r\n      is for you?\u201d Marie is the real Madame Gobain; so you conceal your name\r\n\r\n      behind that of your housekeeper.\u2014Fear nothing, madame, from me. You\r\n\r\n      have in me the most devoted friend you will ever have: Friend, do you\r\n\r\n      understand me? I give this word its sacred and pathetic meaning, so\r\n\r\n      profaned in France, where we apply it to our enemies. And your friend, who\r\n\r\n      will defend you against everything, only wishes that you should be as\r\n\r\n      happy as such a woman ought to be. Who can tell whether the pain I have\r\n\r\n      involuntarily caused you was not a voluntary act?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied she with threatening audacity, \u2018I insist on it. Be\r\n\r\n      curious, and tell me all that you can find out about me; but,\u2019 and she\r\n\r\n      held up her finger, \u2018you must also tell me by what means you obtain your\r\n\r\n      information. The preservation of the small happiness I enjoy here depends\r\n\r\n      on the steps you take.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That means that you will fly\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018On wings!\u2019 she cried, \u2018to the New World\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where you will be at the mercy of the brutal passions you will inspire,\u2019 \r\n\r\n      said I, interrupting her. \u2018Is it not the very essence of genius and beauty\r\n\r\n      to shine, to attract men\u2019s gaze, to excite desires and evil thoughts?\r\n\r\n      Paris is a desert with Bedouins; Paris is the only place in the world\r\n\r\n      where those who must work for their livelihood can hide their life. What\r\n\r\n      have you to complain of? Who am I? An additional servant\u2014M. Gobain,\r\n\r\n      that is all. If you have to fight a duel, you may need a second.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Never mind; find out who I am. I have already said that I insist. Now, I\r\n\r\n      beg that you will,\u2019 she went on, with the grace which you ladies have at\r\n\r\n      command,\u201d said the Consul, looking at the ladies.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, then, to-morrow, at the same hour, I will tell you what I may have\r\n\r\n      discovered,\u2019 replied I. \u2018But do not therefore hate me! Will you behave\r\n\r\n      like other women?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What do other women do?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018They lay upon us immense sacrifices, and when we have made them, they\r\n\r\n      reproach us for it some time later as if it were an injury.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018They are right if the thing required appears to be a sacrifice!\u2019 replied\r\n\r\n      she pointedly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Instead of sacrifices, say efforts and\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It would be an impertinence,\u2019 said she.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Forgive me,\u2019 said I. \u2018I forget that woman and the Pope are infallible.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Good heavens!\u2019 said she after a long pause, \u2018only two words would be\r\n\r\n      enough to destroy the peace so dearly bought, and which I enjoy like a\r\n\r\n      fraud\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe rose and paid no further heed to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where can I go?\u2019 she said. \u2018What is to become of me?\u2014Must I leave\r\n\r\n      this quiet retreat, that I had arranged with such care to end my days in?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018To end your days!\u2019 exclaimed I with visible alarm. \u2018Has it never struck\r\n\r\n      you that a time would come when you could no longer work, when competition\r\n\r\n      will lower the price of flowers and articles of fashion\u2014\u2014?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I have already saved a thousand crowns,\u2019 she said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Heavens! what privations such a sum must represent!\u2019 I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Leave me,\u2019 said she, \u2018till to-morrow. This evening I am not myself; I\r\n\r\n      must be alone. Must I not save my strength in case of disaster? For, if\r\n\r\n      you should learn anything, others besides you would be informed, and then\u2014Good-night,\u2019 \r\n\r\n      she added shortly, dismissing me with an imperious gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The battle is to-morrow, then,\u2019 I replied with a smile, to keep up the\r\n\r\n      appearance of indifference I had given to the scene. But as I went down\r\n\r\n      the avenue I repeated the words:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The battle is to-morrow.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOctave\u2019s anxiety was equal to Honorine\u2019s. The Count and I remained\r\n\r\n      together till two in the morning, walking to and fro by the trenches of\r\n\r\n      the Bastille, like two generals who, on the eve of a battle, calculate all\r\n\r\n      the chances, examine the ground, and perceive that the victory must depend\r\n\r\n      on an opportunity to be seized half-way through the fight. These two\r\n\r\n      divided beings would each lie awake, one in the hope, the other in\r\n\r\n      agonizing dread of reunion. The real dramas of life are not in\r\n\r\n      circumstances, but in feelings; they are played in the heart, or, if you\r\n\r\n      please, in that vast realm which we ought to call the Spiritual World.\r\n\r\n      Octave and Honorine moved and lived altogether in the world of lofty\r\n\r\n      spirits.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was punctual. At ten next evening I was, for the first time, shown into\r\n\r\n      a charming bedroom furnished with white and blue\u2014the nest of this\r\n\r\n      wounded dove. The Countess looked at me, and was about to speak, but was\r\n\r\n      stricken dumb by my respectful demeanor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Madame la Comtesse,\u2019 said I with a grave smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe poor woman, who had risen, dropped back into her chair and remained\r\n\r\n      there, sunk in an attitude of grief, which I should have liked to see\r\n\r\n      perpetuated by a great painter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You are,\u2019 I went on, \u2018the wife of the noblest and most highly respected\r\n\r\n      of men; of a man who is acknowledged to be great, but who is far greater\r\n\r\n      in his conduct to you than he is in the eyes of the world. You and he are\r\n\r\n      two lofty natures.\u2014Where do you suppose yourself to be living?\u2019 I\r\n\r\n      asked her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In my own house,\u2019 she replied, opening her eyes with a wide stare of\r\n\r\n      astonishment.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In Count Octave\u2019s,\u2019 I replied. \u2018You have been tricked. M. Lenormand, the\r\n\r\n      usher of the Court, is not the real owner; he is only a screen for your\r\n\r\n      husband. The delightful seclusion you enjoy is the Count\u2019s work, the money\r\n\r\n      you earn is paid by him, and his protection extends to the most trivial\r\n\r\n      details of your existence. Your husband has saved you in the eyes of the\r\n\r\n      world; he has assigned plausible reasons for your disappearance; he\r\n\r\n      professes to hope that you were not lost in the wreck of the Cecile,\r\n\r\n      the ship in which you sailed for Havana to secure the fortune to be left\r\n\r\n      to you by an old aunt, who might have forgotten you; you embarked,\r\n\r\n      escorted by two ladies of her family and an old man-servant. The Count\r\n\r\n      says that he has sent agents to various spots, and received letters which\r\n\r\n      give him great hopes. He takes as many precautions to hide you from all\r\n\r\n      eyes as you take yourself. In short, he obeys you...\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That is enough,\u2019 she said. \u2018I want to know but one thing more. From whom\r\n\r\n      have you obtained all these details?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, madame, my uncle got a place for a penniless youth as secretary to\r\n\r\n      the Commissary of police in this part of Paris. That young man told me\r\n\r\n      everything. If you leave this house this evening, however stealthily, your\r\n\r\n      husband will know where you are gone, and his care will follow you\r\n\r\n      everywhere.\u2014How could a woman so clever as you are believe that\r\n\r\n      shopkeepers buy flowers and caps as dear as they sell them? Ask a thousand\r\n\r\n      crowns for a bouquet, and you will get it. No mother\u2019s tenderness was ever\r\n\r\n      more ingenious than your husband\u2019s! I have learned from the porter of this\r\n\r\n      house that the Count often comes behind the fence when all are asleep, to\r\n\r\n      see the glimmer of your nightlight! Your large cashmere shawl cost six\r\n\r\n      thousand francs\u2014your old-clothes-seller brings you, as second hand,\r\n\r\n      things fresh from the best makers. In short, you are living here like\r\n\r\n      Venus in the toils of Vulcan; but you are alone in your prison by the\r\n\r\n      devices of a sublime magnanimity, sublime for seven years past, and at\r\n\r\n      every hour.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Countess was trembling as a trapped swallow trembles while, as you\r\n\r\n      hold it in your hand, it strains its neck to look about it with wild eyes.\r\n\r\n      She shook with a nervous spasm, studying me with a defiant look. Her dry\r\n\r\n      eyes glittered with a light that was almost hot: still, she was a woman!\r\n\r\n      The moment came when her tears forced their way, and she wept\u2014not\r\n\r\n      because she was touched, but because she was helpless; they were tears of\r\n\r\n      desperation. She had believed herself independent and free; marriage\r\n\r\n      weighed on her as the prison cell does on the captive.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I will go!\u2019 she cried through her tears. \u2018He forces me to it; I will go\r\n\r\n      where no one certainly will come after me.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What,\u2019 I said, \u2018you would kill yourself?\u2014Madame, you must have\r\n\r\n      some very powerful reasons for not wishing to return to Comte Octave.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Certainly I have!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, then, tell them to me; tell them to my uncle. In us you will find\r\n\r\n      two devoted advisers. Though in the confessional my uncle is a priest, he\r\n\r\n      never is one in a drawing-room. We will hear you; we will try to find a\r\n\r\n      solution of the problems you may lay before us; and if you are the dupe or\r\n\r\n      the victim of some misapprehension, perhaps we can clear the matter up.\r\n\r\n      Your soul, I believe, is pure; but if you have done wrong, your fault is\r\n\r\n      fully expiated.... At any rate, remember that in me you have a most\r\n\r\n      sincere friend. If you should wish to evade the Count\u2019s tyranny, I will\r\n\r\n      find you the means; he shall never find you.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Oh! there is always a convent!\u2019 said she.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Yes. But the Count, as Minister of State, can procure your rejection by\r\n\r\n      every convent in the world. Even though he is powerful, I will save you\r\n\r\n      from him\u2014; but\u2014only when you have demonstrated to me that you\r\n\r\n      cannot and ought not to return to him. Oh! do not fear that you would\r\n\r\n      escape his power only to fall into mine,\u2019 I added, noticing a glance of\r\n\r\n      horrible suspicion, full of exaggerated dignity. \u2018You shall have peace,\r\n\r\n      solitude, and independence; in short, you shall be as free and as little\r\n\r\n      annoyed as if you were an ugly, cross old maid. I myself would never be\r\n\r\n      able to see you without your consent.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And how? By what means?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That is my secret. I am not deceiving you, of that you may be sure.\r\n\r\n      Prove to me that this is the only life you can lead, that it is preferable\r\n\r\n      to that of the Comtesse Octave, rich, admired, in one of the finest houses\r\n\r\n      in Paris, beloved by her husband, a happy mother... and I will decide in\r\n\r\n      your favor.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But,\u2019 said she, \u2018will there never be a man who understands me?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No. And that is why I appeal to religion to decide between us. The Cure\r\n\r\n      of the White Friars is a saint, seventy-five years of age. My uncle is not\r\n\r\n      a Grand Inquisitor, he is Saint John; but for you he will be Fenelon\u2014the\r\n\r\n      Fenelon who said to the Duc de Bourgogne: \u2018Eat a calf on a Friday by all\r\n\r\n      means, monseigneur. But be a Christian.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Nay, nay, monsieur, the convent is my last hope and my only refuge.\r\n\r\n      There is none but God who can understand me. No man, not Saint Augustine\r\n\r\n      himself, the tenderest of the Fathers of the Church, could enter into the\r\n\r\n      scruples of my conscience, which are to me as the circles of Dante\u2019s hell,\r\n\r\n      whence there is no escape. Another than my husband, a different man,\r\n\r\n      however unworthy of the offering, has had all my love. No, he has not had\r\n\r\n      it, for he did not take it; I gave it him as a mother gives her child a\r\n\r\n      wonderful toy, which it breaks. For me there never could be two loves. In\r\n\r\n      some natures love can never be on trial; it is, or it is not. When it\r\n\r\n      comes, when it rises up, it is complete.\u2014Well, that life of eighteen\r\n\r\n      months was to me a life of eighteen years; I threw into it all the\r\n\r\n      faculties of my being, which were not impoverished by their effusiveness;\r\n\r\n      they were exhausted by that delusive intimacy in which I alone was\r\n\r\n      genuine. For me the cup of happiness is not drained, nor empty; and\r\n\r\n      nothing can refill it, for it is broken. I am out of the fray; I have no\r\n\r\n      weapons left. Having thus utterly abandoned myself, what am I?\u2014the\r\n\r\n      leavings of a feast. I had but one name bestowed on me, Honorine, as I had\r\n\r\n      but one heart. My husband had the young girl, a worthless lover had the\r\n\r\n      woman\u2014there is nothing left!\u2014Then let myself be loved! that is\r\n\r\n      the great idea you mean to utter to me. Oh! but I still am something, and\r\n\r\n      I rebel at the idea of being a prostitute! Yes, by the light of the\r\n\r\n      conflagration I saw clearly; and I tell you\u2014well, I could imagine\r\n\r\n      surrendering to another man\u2019s love, but to Octave\u2019s?\u2014No, never.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Ah! you love him,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I esteem him, respect him, venerate him; he never has done me the\r\n\r\n      smallest hurt; he is kind, he is tender; but I can never more love him.\r\n\r\n      However,\u2019 she went on, \u2018let us talk no more of this. Discussion makes\r\n\r\n      everything small. I will express my notions on this subject in writing to\r\n\r\n      you, for at this moment they are suffocating me; I am feverish, my feet\r\n\r\n      are standing in the ashes of my Paraclete. All that I see, these things\r\n\r\n      which I believed I had earned by my labor, now remind me of everything I\r\n\r\n      wish to forget. Ah! I must fly from hence as I fled from my home.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where will you go?\u2019 I asked. \u2018Can a woman exist unprotected? At thirty,\r\n\r\n      in all the glory of your beauty, rich in powers of which you have no\r\n\r\n      suspicion, full of tenderness to be bestowed, are you prepared to live in\r\n\r\n      the wilderness where I could hide you?\u2014Be quite easy. The Count, who\r\n\r\n      for nine years has never allowed himself to be seen here, will never go\r\n\r\n      there without your permission. You have his sublime devotion of nine years\r\n\r\n      as a guarantee for your tranquillity. You may therefore discuss the future\r\n\r\n      in perfect confidence with my uncle and me. My uncle has as much influence\r\n\r\n      as a Minister of State. So compose yourself; do not exaggerate your\r\n\r\n      misfortune. A priest whose hair has grown white in the exercise of his\r\n\r\n      functions is not a boy; you will be understood by him to whom every\r\n\r\n      passion has been confided for nearly fifty years now, and who weighs in\r\n\r\n      his hands the ponderous heart of kings and princes. If he is stern under\r\n\r\n      his stole, in the presence of your flowers he will be as tender as they\r\n\r\n      are, and as indulgent as his Divine Master.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI left the Countess at midnight; she was apparently calm, but depressed,\r\n\r\n      and had some secret purpose which no perspicacity could guess. I found the\r\n\r\n      Count a few paces off, in the Rue Saint-Maur. Drawn by an irresistible\r\n\r\n      attraction, he had quitted the spot on the Boulevards where we had agreed\r\n\r\n      to meet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What a night my poor child will go through!\u2019 he exclaimed, when I had\r\n\r\n      finished my account of the scene that had just taken place. \u2018Supposing I\r\n\r\n      were to go to her!\u2019 he added; \u2018supposing she were to see me suddenly?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018At this moment she is capable of throwing herself out of the window,\u2019 I\r\n\r\n      replied. \u2018The Countess is one of those Lucretias who could not survive any\r\n\r\n      violence, even if it were done by a man into whose arms she could throw\r\n\r\n      herself.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You are young,\u2019 he answered; \u2018you do not know that in a soul tossed by\r\n\r\n      such dreadful alternatives the will is like waters of a lake lashed by a\r\n\r\n      tempest; the wind changes every instant, and the waves are driven now to\r\n\r\n      one shore, now to the other. During this night the chances are quite as\r\n\r\n      great that on seeing me Honorine might rush into my arms as that she would\r\n\r\n      throw herself out of the window.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And you would accept the equal chances,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well, come,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have at home, to enable me to wait till\r\n\r\n      to-morrow, a dose of opium which Desplein prepared for me to send me to\r\n\r\n      sleep without any risk!\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNext day at noon Gobain brought me a letter, telling me that the Countess\r\n\r\n      had gone to bed at six, worn out with fatigue, and that, having taken a\r\n\r\n      soothing draught prepared by the chemist, she had now fallen asleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is her letter, of which I kept a copy\u2014for you, mademoiselle,\u201d\r\n\r\n       said the Consul, addressing Camille, \u201cknow all the resources of art, the\r\n\r\n      tricks of style, and the efforts made in their compositions by writers who\r\n\r\n      do not lack skill; but you will acknowledge that literature could never\r\n\r\n      find such language in its assumed pathos; there is nothing so terrible as\r\n\r\n      truth. Here is the letter written by this woman, or rather by this\r\n\r\n      anguish:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018MONSIEUR MAURICE,\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I know all your uncle would say to me; he is not better informed than my\r\n\r\n      own conscience. Conscience is the interpreter of God to man. I know that\r\n\r\n      if I am not reconciled to Octave, I shall be damned; that is the sentence\r\n\r\n      of religious law. Civil law condemns me to obey, cost what it may. If my\r\n\r\n      husband does not reject me, the world will regard me as pure, as virtuous,\r\n\r\n      whatever I may have done. Yes, that much is sublime in marriage; society\r\n\r\n      ratifies the husband\u2019s forgiveness; but it forgets that the forgiveness\r\n\r\n      must be accepted. Legally, religiously, and from the world\u2019s point of view\r\n\r\n      I ought to go back to Octave. Keeping only to the human aspect of the\r\n\r\n      question, is it not cruel to refuse him happiness, to deprive him of\r\n\r\n      children, to wipe his name out of the Golden Book and the list of peers?\r\n\r\n      My sufferings, my repugnance, my feelings, all my egoism\u2014for I know\r\n\r\n      that I am an egoist\u2014ought to be sacrificed to the family. I shall be\r\n\r\n      a mother; the caresses of my child will wipe away many tears! I shall be\r\n\r\n      very happy; I certainly shall be much looked up to. I shall ride, haughty\r\n\r\n      and wealthy, in a handsome carriage! I shall have servants and a fine\r\n\r\n      house, and be the queen of as many parties as there are weeks in the year.\r\n\r\n      The world will receive me handsomely. I shall not have to climb up again\r\n\r\n      to the heaven of aristocracy, I shall never have come down from it. So\r\n\r\n      God, the law, society are all in accord.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"What are you rebelling against?\u201d I am asked from the height of heaven,\r\n\r\n      from the pulpit, from the judge\u2019s bench, and from the throne, whose august\r\n\r\n      intervention may at need be invoked by the Count. Your uncle, indeed, at\r\n\r\n      need, would speak to me of a certain celestial grace which will flood my\r\n\r\n      heart when I know the pleasure of doing my duty.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018God, the law, the world, and Octave all wish me to live, no doubt. Well,\r\n\r\n      if there is no other difficulty, my reply cuts the knot: I will not live.\r\n\r\n      I will become white and innocent again; for I will lie in my shroud, white\r\n\r\n      with the blameless pallor of death. This is not in the least \u201cmulish\r\n\r\n      obstinacy.\u201d That mulish obstinacy of which you jestingly accused me is in\r\n\r\n      a woman the result of confidence, of a vision of the future. Though my\r\n\r\n      husband, sublimely generous, may forget all, I shall not forget. Does\r\n\r\n      forgetfulness depend on our will? When a widow re-marries, love makes a\r\n\r\n      girl of her; she marries a man she loves. But I cannot love the Count. It\r\n\r\n      all lies in that, do not you see?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Every time my eyes met his I should see my sin in them, even when his\r\n\r\n      were full of love. The greatness of his generosity would be the measure of\r\n\r\n      the greatness of my crime. My eyes, always uneasy, would be for ever\r\n\r\n      reading an invisible condemnation. My heart would be full of confused and\r\n\r\n      struggling memories; marriage can never move me to the cruel rapture, the\r\n\r\n      mortal delirium of passion. I should kill my husband by my coldness, by\r\n\r\n      comparisons which he would guess, though hidden in the depths of my\r\n\r\n      conscience. Oh! on the day when I should read a trace of involuntary, even\r\n\r\n      of suppressed reproach in a furrow on his brow, in a saddened look, in\r\n\r\n      some imperceptible gesture, nothing could hold me: I should be lying with\r\n\r\n      a fractured skull on the pavement, and find that less hard than my\r\n\r\n      husband. It might be my own over-susceptibility that would lead me to this\r\n\r\n      horrible but welcome death; I might die the victim of an impatient mood in\r\n\r\n      Octave caused by some matter of business, or be deceived by some unjust\r\n\r\n      suspicion. Alas! I might even mistake some proof of love for a sign of\r\n\r\n      contempt!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What torture on both sides! Octave would be always doubting me, I\r\n\r\n      doubting him. I, quite involuntarily, should give him a rival wholly\r\n\r\n      unworthy of him, a man whom I despise, but with whom I have known raptures\r\n\r\n      branded on me with fire, which are my shame, but which I cannot forget.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Have I shown you enough of my heart? No one, monsieur, can convince me\r\n\r\n      that love may be renewed, for I neither can nor will accept love from any\r\n\r\n      one. A young bride is like a plucked flower; but a guilty wife is like a\r\n\r\n      flower that had been walked over. You, who are a florist, you know whether\r\n\r\n      it is ever possible to restore the broken stem, to revive the faded\r\n\r\n      colors, to make the sap flow again in the tender vessels of which the\r\n\r\n      whole vegetative function lies in their perfect rigidity. If some botanist\r\n\r\n      should attempt the operation, could his genius smooth out the folds of the\r\n\r\n      bruised corolla? If he could remake a flower, he would be God! God alone\r\n\r\n      can remake me! I am drinking the bitter cup of expiation; but as I drink\r\n\r\n      it I painfully spell out this sentence: Expiation is not annihilation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In my little house, alone, I eat my bread soaked in tears; but no one\r\n\r\n      sees me eat nor sees me weep. If I go back to Octave, I must give up my\r\n\r\n      tears\u2014they would offend him. Oh! monsieur, how many virtues must a\r\n\r\n      woman tread under foot, not to give herself, but to restore herself to a\r\n\r\n      betrayed husband? Who could count them? God alone; for He alone can know\r\n\r\n      and encourage the horrible refinements at which the angels must turn pale.\r\n\r\n      Nay, I will go further. A woman has courage in the presence of her husband\r\n\r\n      if he knows nothing; she shows a sort of fierce strength in her hypocrisy;\r\n\r\n      she deceives him to secure him double happiness. But common knowledge is\r\n\r\n      surely degrading. Supposing I could exchange humiliation for ecstasy?\r\n\r\n      Would not Octave at last feel that my consent was sheer depravity?\r\n\r\n      Marriage is based on esteem, on sacrifices on both sides; but neither\r\n\r\n      Octave nor I could esteem each other the day after our reunion. He would\r\n\r\n      have disgraced me by a love like that of an old man for a courtesan, and I\r\n\r\n      should for ever feel the shame of being a chattel instead of a lady. I\r\n\r\n      should represent pleasure, and not virtue, in his house. These are the\r\n\r\n      bitter fruits of such a sin. I have made myself a bed where I can only\r\n\r\n      toss on burning coals, a sleepless pillow.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Here, when I suffer, I bless my sufferings; I say to God, \u201cI thank\r\n\r\n      Thee!\u201d But in my husband\u2019s house I should be full of terror, tasting joys\r\n\r\n      to which I have no right.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018All this, monsieur, is not argument; it is the feeling of a soul made\r\n\r\n      vast and hollow by seven years of suffering. Finally, must I make a\r\n\r\n      horrible confession? I shall always feel at my bosom the lips of a child\r\n\r\n      conceived in rapture and joy, and in the belief in happiness, of a child I\r\n\r\n      nursed for seven months, that I shall bear in my womb all the days of my\r\n\r\n      life. If other children should draw their nourishment from me, they would\r\n\r\n      drink in tears mingling with the milk, and turning it sour. I seem a light\r\n\r\n      thing, you regard me as a child\u2014Ah yes! I have a child\u2019s memory, the\r\n\r\n      memory which returns to us on the verge of the tomb. So, you see, there is\r\n\r\n      not a situation in that beautiful life to which the world and my husband\u2019s\r\n\r\n      love want to recall me, which is not a false position, which does not\r\n\r\n      cover a snare or reveal a precipice down which I must fall, torn by\r\n\r\n      pitiless rocks. For five years now I have been wandering in the sandy\r\n\r\n      desert of the future without finding a place convenient to repent in,\r\n\r\n      because my soul is possessed by true repentance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Religion has its answers ready to all this, and I know them by heart.\r\n\r\n      This suffering, these difficulties, are my punishment, she says, and God\r\n\r\n      will give me strength to endure them. This, monsieur, is an argument to\r\n\r\n      certain pious souls gifted with an energy which I have not. I have made my\r\n\r\n      choice between this hell, where God does not forbid my blessing Him, and\r\n\r\n      the hell that awaits me under Count Octave\u2019s roof.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018One word more. If I were still a girl, with the experience I now have,\r\n\r\n      my husband is the man I should choose; but that is the very reason of my\r\n\r\n      refusal. I could not bear to blush before that man. What! I should be\r\n\r\n      always on my knees, he always standing upright; and if we were to exchange\r\n\r\n      positions, I should scorn him! I will not be better treated by him in\r\n\r\n      consequence of my sin. The angel who might venture under such\r\n\r\n      circumstances on certain liberties which are permissible when both are\r\n\r\n      equally blameless, is not on earth; he dwells in heaven! Octave is full of\r\n\r\n      delicate feeling, I know; but even in his soul (which, however generous,\r\n\r\n      is a man\u2019s soul after all) there is no guarantee for the new life I should\r\n\r\n      lead with him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Come then, and tell me where I may find the solitude, the peace, the\r\n\r\n      silence, so kindly to irreparable woes, which you promised me.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter making this copy of the letter to preserve it complete, I went to\r\n\r\n      the Rue Payenne. Anxiety had conquered the power of opium. Octave was\r\n\r\n      walking up and down his garden like a madman.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Answer that!\u2019 said I, giving him his wife\u2019s letter. \u2018Try to reassure the\r\n\r\n      modesty of experience. It is rather more difficult than conquering the\r\n\r\n      modesty of ignorance, which curiosity helps to betray.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018She is mine!\u2019 cried the Count, whose face expressed joy as he went on\r\n\r\n      reading the letter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe signed to me with his hand to leave him to himself. I understood that\r\n\r\n      extreme happiness and extreme pain obey the same laws; I went in to\r\n\r\n      receive Madame de Courteville and Amelie, who were to dine with the Count\r\n\r\n      that day. However handsome Mademoiselle de Courteville might be, I felt,\r\n\r\n      on seeing her once more, that love has three aspects, and that the women\r\n\r\n      who can inspire us with perfect love are very rare. As I involuntarily\r\n\r\n      compared Amelie with Honorine, I found the erring wife more attractive\r\n\r\n      than the pure girl. To Honorine\u2019s heart fidelity had not been a duty, but\r\n\r\n      the inevitable; while Amelie would serenely pronounce the most solemn\r\n\r\n      promises without knowing their purport or to what they bound her. The\r\n\r\n      crushed, the dead woman, so to speak, the sinner to be reinstated, seemed\r\n\r\n      to me sublime; she incited the special generosities of a man\u2019s nature; she\r\n\r\n      demanded all the treasures of the heart, all the resources of strength;\r\n\r\n      she filled his life and gave the zest of a conflict to happiness; whereas\r\n\r\n      Amelie, chaste and confiding, would settle down into the sphere of\r\n\r\n      peaceful motherhood, where the commonplace must be its poetry, and where\r\n\r\n      my mind would find no struggle and no victory.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf the plains of Champagne and the snowy, storm-beaten but sublime Alps,\r\n\r\n      what young man would choose the chalky, monotonous level? No; such\r\n\r\n      comparisons are fatal and wrong on the threshold of the Mairie. Alas! only\r\n\r\n      the experience of life can teach us that marriage excludes passion, that a\r\n\r\n      family cannot have its foundation on the tempests of love. After having\r\n\r\n      dreamed of impossible love, with its infinite caprices, after having\r\n\r\n      tasted the tormenting delights of the ideal, I saw before me modest\r\n\r\n      reality. Pity me, for what could be expected! At five-and-twenty I did not\r\n\r\n      trust myself; but I took a manful resolution.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI went back to the Count to announce the arrival of his relations, and I\r\n\r\n      saw him grown young again in the reflected light of hope.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What ails you, Maurice?\u2019 said he, struck by my changed expression.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Monsieur le Comte\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No longer Octave? You, to whom I shall owe my life, my happiness\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018My dear Octave, if you should succeed in bringing the Countess back to\r\n\r\n      her duty, I have studied her well\u2019\u2014(he looked at me as Othello must\r\n\r\n      have looked at Iago when Iago first contrived to insinuate a suspicion\r\n\r\n      into the Moor\u2019s mind)\u2014\u2018she must never see me again; she must never\r\n\r\n      know that Maurice was your secretary. Never mention my name to her, or all\r\n\r\n      will be undone.... You have got me an appointment as Maitre des Requetes\u2014well,\r\n\r\n      get me instead some diplomatic post abroad, a consulship, and do not think\r\n\r\n      of my marrying Amelie.\u2014Oh! do not be uneasy,\u2019 I added, seeing him\r\n\r\n      draw himself up, \u2018I will play my part to the end.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Poor boy!\u2019 said he, taking my hand, which he pressed, while he kept back\r\n\r\n      the tears that were starting to his eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You gave me the gloves,\u2019 I said, laughing, \u2018but I have not put them on;\r\n\r\n      that is all.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe then agreed as to what I was to do that evening at Honorine\u2019s house,\r\n\r\n      whither I presently returned. It was now August; the day had been hot and\r\n\r\n      stormy, but the storm hung overhead, the sky was like copper; the scent of\r\n\r\n      the flowers was heavy, I felt as if I were in an oven, and caught myself\r\n\r\n      wishing that the Countess might have set out for the Indies; but she was\r\n\r\n      sitting on a wooden bench shaped like a sofa, under an arbor, in a loose\r\n\r\n      dress of white muslin fastened with blue bows, her hair unadorned in\r\n\r\n      waving bands over her cheeks, her feet on a small wooden stool, and\r\n\r\n      showing a little way beyond her skirt. She did not rise; she showed me\r\n\r\n      with her hand to the seat by her side, saying:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Now, is not life at a deadlock for me?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Life as you have made it, I replied. \u2018But not the life I propose to make\r\n\r\n      for you; for, if you choose, you may be very happy....\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018How?\u2019 said she; her whole person was a question.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Your letter is in the Count\u2019s hands.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHonorine started like a frightened doe, sprang to a few paces off, walked\r\n\r\n      down the garden, turned about, remained standing for some minutes, and\r\n\r\n      finally went in to sit alone in the drawing-room, where I joined her,\r\n\r\n      after giving her time to get accustomed to the pain of this poniard\r\n\r\n      thrust.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You\u2014a friend? Say rather a traitor! A spy, perhaps, sent by my\r\n\r\n      husband.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cInstinct in women is as strong as the perspicacity of great men.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You wanted an answer to your letter, did you not? And there was but one\r\n\r\n      man in the world who could write it. You must read the reply, my dear\r\n\r\n      Countess; and if after reading it you still find that your life is a\r\n\r\n      deadlock, the spy will prove himself a friend; I will place you in a\r\n\r\n      convent whence the Count\u2019s power cannot drag you. But, before going there,\r\n\r\n      let us consider the other side of the question. There is a law, alike\r\n\r\n      divine and human, which even hatred affects to obey, and which commands us\r\n\r\n      not to condemn the accused without hearing his defence. Till now you have\r\n\r\n      passed condemnation, as children do, with your ears stopped. The devotion\r\n\r\n      of seven years has its claims. So you must read the answer your husband\r\n\r\n      will send you. I have forwarded to him, through my uncle, a copy of your\r\n\r\n      letter, and my uncle asked him what his reply would be if his wife wrote\r\n\r\n      him a letter in such terms. Thus you are not compromised. He will himself\r\n\r\n      bring the Count\u2019s answer. In the presence of that saintly man, and in\r\n\r\n      mine, out of respect for your own dignity, you must read it, or you will\r\n\r\n      be no better than a wilful, passionate child. You must make this sacrifice\r\n\r\n      to the world, to the law, and to God.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs she saw in this concession no attack on her womanly resolve, she\r\n\r\n      consented. All the labor or four or five months had been building up to\r\n\r\n      this moment. But do not the Pyramids end in a point on which a bird may\r\n\r\n      perch? The Count had set all his hopes on this supreme instant, and he had\r\n\r\n      reached it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn all my life I remember nothing more formidable than my uncle\u2019s\r\n\r\n      entrance into that little Pompadour drawing-room, at ten that evening. The\r\n\r\n      fine head, with its silver hair thrown into relief by the entirely black\r\n\r\n      dress, and the divinely calm face, had a magical effect on the Comtesse\r\n\r\n      Honorine; she had the feeling of cool balm on her wounds, and beamed in\r\n\r\n      the reflection of that virtue which gave light without knowing it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Monsieur the Cure of the White Friars,\u2019 said old Gobain.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Are you come, uncle, with a message of happiness and peace?\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Happiness and peace are always to be found in obedience to the precepts\r\n\r\n      of the Church,\u2019 replied my uncle, and he handed the Countess the following\r\n\r\n      letter:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018MY DEAR HONORINE,\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If you had but done me the favor of trusting me, if you had read the\r\n\r\n      letter I wrote to you five years since, you would have spared yourself\r\n\r\n      five years of useless labor, and of privations which have grieved me\r\n\r\n      deeply. In it I proposed an arrangement of which the stipulations will\r\n\r\n      relieve all your fears, and make our domestic life possible. I have much\r\n\r\n      to reproach myself with, and in seven years of sorrow I have discovered\r\n\r\n      all my errors. I misunderstood marriage. I failed to scent danger when it\r\n\r\n      threatened you. An angel was in the house. The Lord bid me guard it well!\r\n\r\n      The Lord has punished me for my audacious confidence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You cannot give yourself a single lash without striking me. Have mercy\r\n\r\n      on me, my dear Honorine. I so fully appreciated your susceptibilities that\r\n\r\n      I would not bring you back to the old house in the Rue Payenne, where I\r\n\r\n      can live without you, but which I could not bear to see again with you. I\r\n\r\n      am decorating, with great pleasure, another house, in the Faubourg\r\n\r\n      Saint-Honore, to which, in hope, I conduct not a wife whom I owe to her\r\n\r\n      ignorance of life, and secured to me by law, but a sister who will allow\r\n\r\n      me to press on her brow such a kiss as a father gives the daughter he\r\n\r\n      blesses every day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Will you bereave me of the right I have conquered from your despair\u2014that\r\n\r\n      of watching more closely over your needs, your pleasures, your life even?\r\n\r\n      Women have one heart always on their side, always abounding in excuses\u2014their\r\n\r\n      mother\u2019s; you never knew any mother but my mother, who would have brought\r\n\r\n      you back to me. But how is it that you never guessed that I had for you\r\n\r\n      the heart of a mother, both of my mother and of your own? Yes, dear, my\r\n\r\n      affection is neither mean nor grasping; it is one of those which will\r\n\r\n      never let any annoyance last long enough to pucker the brow of the child\r\n\r\n      it worships. What can you think of the companion of your childhood,\r\n\r\n      Honorine, if you believe him capable of accepting kisses given in\r\n\r\n      trembling, of living between delight and anxiety? Do not fear that you\r\n\r\n      will be exposed to the laments of a suppliant passion; I would not want\r\n\r\n      you back until I felt certain of my own strength to leave you in perfect\r\n\r\n      freedom.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Your solitary pride has exaggerated the difficulties. You may, if you\r\n\r\n      will, look on at the life of a brother, or of a father, without either\r\n\r\n      suffering or joy; but you will find neither mockery nor indifference, nor\r\n\r\n      have any doubt as to his intentions. The warmth of the atmosphere in which\r\n\r\n      you live will be always equable and genial, without tempests, without a\r\n\r\n      possible squall. If, later, when you feel secure that you are as much at\r\n\r\n      home as in your own little house, you desire to try some other elements of\r\n\r\n      happiness, pleasures, or amusements, you can expand their circle at your\r\n\r\n      will. The tenderness of a mother knows neither contempt nor pity. What is\r\n\r\n      it? Love without desire. Well, in me admiration shall hide every sentiment\r\n\r\n      in which you might see an offence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Thus, living side by side, we may both be magnanimous. In you the\r\n\r\n      kindness of a sister, the affectionate thoughtfulness of a friend, will\r\n\r\n      satisfy the ambition of him who wishes to be your life\u2019s companion; and\r\n\r\n      you may measure his tenderness by the care he will take to conceal it.\r\n\r\n      Neither you nor I will be jealous of the past, for we may each acknowledge\r\n\r\n      that the other has sense enough to look only straight forward.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Thus you will be at home in your new house exactly as you are in the Rue\r\n\r\n      Saint-Maur; unapproachable, alone, occupied as you please, living by your\r\n\r\n      own law; but having in addition the legitimate protection, of which you\r\n\r\n      are now exacting the most chivalrous labors of love, with the\r\n\r\n      consideration which lends so much lustre to a woman, and the fortune which\r\n\r\n      will allow of your doing many good works. Honorine, when you long for an\r\n\r\n      unnecessary absolution, you have only to ask for it; it will not be forced\r\n\r\n      upon you by the Church or by the Law; it will wait on your pride, on your\r\n\r\n      own impulsion. My wife might indeed have to fear all the things you dread;\r\n\r\n      but not my friend and sister, towards whom I am bound to show every form\r\n\r\n      and refinement of politeness. To see you happy is enough happiness for me;\r\n\r\n      I have proved this for the seven years past. The guarantee for this,\r\n\r\n      Honorine, is to be seen in all the flowers made by you, carefully\r\n\r\n      preserved, and watered by my tears. Like the quipos, the tally\r\n\r\n      cords of the Peruvians, they are the record of our sorrows.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If this secret compact does not suit you, my child, I have begged the\r\n\r\n      saintly man who takes charge of this letter not to say a word in my\r\n\r\n      behalf. I will not owe your return to the terrors threatened by the\r\n\r\n      Church, nor to the bidding of the Law. I will not accept the simple and\r\n\r\n      quiet happiness that I ask from any one but yourself. If you persist in\r\n\r\n      condemning me to the lonely life, bereft even of a fraternal smile, which\r\n\r\n      I have led for nine years, if you remain in your solitude and show no\r\n\r\n      sign, my will yields to yours. Understand me perfectly: you shall be no\r\n\r\n      more troubled than you have been until this day. I will get rid of the\r\n\r\n      crazy fellow who has meddled in your concerns, and has perhaps caused you\r\n\r\n      some annoyance...\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Monsieur,\u2019 said Honorine, folding up the letter, which she placed in her\r\n\r\n      bosom, and looking at my uncle, \u2018thank you very much. I will avail myself\r\n\r\n      of Monsieur le Comte\u2019s permission to remain here\u2014\u2014\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis exclamation made my uncle look at me uneasily, and won from the\r\n\r\n      Countess a mischievous glance, which enlightened me as to her motives.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHonorine had wanted to ascertain whether I were an actor, a bird snarer;\r\n\r\n      and I had the melancholy satisfaction of deceiving her by my exclamation,\r\n\r\n      which was one of those cries from the heart which women understand so\r\n\r\n      well.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Ah, Maurice,\u2019 said she, \u2018you know how to love.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe light that flashed in my eyes was another reply which would have\r\n\r\n      dissipated the Countess\u2019 uneasiness if she still had any. Thus the Count\r\n\r\n      found me useful to the very last.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHonorine then took out the Count\u2019s letter again to finish reading it. My\r\n\r\n      uncle signed to me, and I rose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Let us leave the Countess,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You are going already Maurice?\u2019 she said, without looking at me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe rose, and still reading, followed us to the door. On the threshold\r\n\r\n      she took my hand, pressed it very affectionately, and said, \u2018We shall meet\r\n\r\n      again...\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 I replied, wringing her hand, so that she cried out. \u2018You love your\r\n\r\n      husband. I leave to-morrow.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd I rushed away, leaving my uncle, to whom she said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Why, what is the matter with your nephew?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe good Abbe completed my work by pointing to his head and heart, as\r\n\r\n      much as to say, \u2018He is mad, madame; you must forgive him!\u2019 and with all\r\n\r\n      the more truth, because he really thought it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSix days after, I set out with an appointment as vice-consul in Spain, in\r\n\r\n      a large commercial town, where I could quickly qualify to rise in the\r\n\r\n      career of a consul, to which I now restricted my ambition. After I had\r\n\r\n      established myself there, I received this letter from the Count:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018MY DEAR MAURICE,\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If I were happy, I should not write to you, but I have entered on a new\r\n\r\n      life of suffering. I have grown young again in my desires, with all the\r\n\r\n      impatience of a man of forty, and the prudence of a diplomatist, who has\r\n\r\n      learned to moderate his passion. When you left I had not yet been admitted\r\n\r\n      to the pavillon in the Rue Saint-Maur, but a letter had promised me\r\n\r\n      that I should have permission\u2014the mild and melancholy letter of a\r\n\r\n      woman who dreaded the agitations of a meeting. After waiting for more than\r\n\r\n      a month, I made bold to call, and desired Gobain to inquire whether I\r\n\r\n      could be received. I sat down in a chair in the avenue near the lodge, my\r\n\r\n      head buried in my hands, and there I remained for almost an hour.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Madame had to dress,\u201d said Gobain, to hide Honorine\u2019s hesitancy under a\r\n\r\n      pride of appearance which was flattering to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018During a long quarter of an hour we both of us were possessed by an\r\n\r\n      involuntary nervous trembling as great as that which seizes a speaker on\r\n\r\n      the platform, and we spoke to each other sacred phrases, like those of\r\n\r\n      persons taken by surprise who \u201cmake believe\u201d a conversation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"You see, Honorine,\u201d said I, my eyes full of tears, \u201cthe ice is broken,\r\n\r\n      and I am so tremulous with happiness that you must forgive the incoherency\r\n\r\n      of my language. It will be so for a long time yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"There is no crime in being in love with your wife,\u201d said she with a\r\n\r\n      forced smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Do me the favor,\u201d said I, \u201cno longer to work as you do. I have heard\r\n\r\n      from Madame Gobain that for three weeks you have been living on your\r\n\r\n      savings; you have sixty thousand francs a year of your own, and if you\r\n\r\n      cannot give me back your heart, at least do not abandon your fortune to\r\n\r\n      me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"I have long known your kindness,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Though you should prefer to remain here,\u201d said I, \u201cand to preserve your\r\n\r\n      independence; though the most ardent love should find no favor in your\r\n\r\n      eyes, still, do not toil.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I gave her three certificates for twelve thousand francs a year each;\r\n\r\n      she took them, opened them languidly, and after reading them through she\r\n\r\n      gave me only a look as my reward. She fully understood that I was not\r\n\r\n      offering her money, but freedom.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"I am conquered,\u201d said she, holding out her hand, which I kissed. \u201cCome\r\n\r\n      and see me as often as you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018So she had done herself a violence in receiving me. Next day I found her\r\n\r\n      armed with affected high spirits, and it took two months of habit before I\r\n\r\n      saw her in her true character. But then it was like a delicious May, a\r\n\r\n      springtime of love that gave me ineffable bliss; she was no longer afraid;\r\n\r\n      she was studying me. Alas! when I proposed that she should go to England\r\n\r\n      to return ostensibly to me, to our home, that she should resume her rank\r\n\r\n      and live in our new residence, she was seized with alarm.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Why not live always as we are?\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I submitted without saying a word.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Is she making an experiment?\u201d I asked myself as I left her. On my way\r\n\r\n      from my own house to the Rue Saint-Maur thoughts of love had swelled in my\r\n\r\n      heart, and I had said to myself, like a young man, \u201cThis evening she will\r\n\r\n      yield.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018All my real or affected force was blown to the winds by a smile, by a\r\n\r\n      command from those proud, calm eyes, untouched by passion. I remembered\r\n\r\n      the terrible words you once quoted to me, \u201cLucretia\u2019s dagger wrote in\r\n\r\n      letters of blood the watchword of woman\u2019s charter\u2014Liberty!\u201d and they\r\n\r\n      froze me. I felt imperatively how necessary to me was Honorine\u2019s consent,\r\n\r\n      and how impossible it was to wring it from her. Could she guess the storms\r\n\r\n      that distracted me when I left as when I came?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018At last I painted my situation in a letter to her, giving up the attempt\r\n\r\n      to speak of it. Honorine made no answer, and she was so sad that I made as\r\n\r\n      though I had not written. I was deeply grieved by the idea that I could\r\n\r\n      have distressed her; she read my heart and forgave me. And this was how.\r\n\r\n      Three days ago she received me, for the first time, in her own\r\n\r\n      blue-and-white room. It was bright with flowers, dressed, and lighted up.\r\n\r\n      Honorine was in a dress that made her bewitching. Her hair framed that\r\n\r\n      face that you know in its light curls; and in it were some sprays of Cape\r\n\r\n      heath; she wore a white muslin gown, a white sash with long floating ends.\r\n\r\n      You know what she is in such simplicity, but that day she was a bride, the\r\n\r\n      Honorine of long past days. My joy was chilled at once, for her face was\r\n\r\n      terribly grave; there were fires beneath the ice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Octave,\u201d she said, \u201cI will return as your wife when you will. But\r\n\r\n      understand clearly that this submission has its dangers. I can be resigned\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I made a movement.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Yes,\u201d she went on, \u201cI understand: resignation offends you, and you want\r\n\r\n      what I cannot give\u2014Love. Religion and pity led me to renounce my vow\r\n\r\n      of solitude; you are here!\u201d She paused.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"At first,\u201d she went on, \u201cyou asked no more. Now you demand your wife.\r\n\r\n      Well, here I give you Honorine, such as she is, without deceiving you as\r\n\r\n      to what she will be.\u2014What shall I be? A mother? I hope it. Believe\r\n\r\n      me, I hope it eagerly. Try to change me; you have my consent; but if I\r\n\r\n      should die, my dear, do not curse my memory, and do not set down to\r\n\r\n      obstinacy what I should call the worship of the Ideal, if it were not more\r\n\r\n      natural to call the indefinable feeling which must kill me the worship of\r\n\r\n      the Divine! The future will be nothing to me; it will be your concern;\r\n\r\n      consult your own mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And she sat down in the calm attitude you used to admire, and watched me\r\n\r\n      turning pale with the pain she had inflicted. My blood ran cold. On seeing\r\n\r\n      the effect of her words she took both my hands, and, holding them in her\r\n\r\n      own, she said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"Octave, I do love you, but not in the way you wish to be loved. I love\r\n\r\n      your soul.... Still, understand that I love you enough to die in your\r\n\r\n      service like an Eastern slave, and without a regret. It will be my\r\n\r\n      expiation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018She did more; she knelt before me on a cushion, and in a spirit of\r\n\r\n      sublime charity she said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\"And perhaps I shall not die!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018For two months now I have been struggling with myself. What shall I do?\r\n\r\n      My heart is too full; I therefore seek a friend, and send out this cry,\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not answer this letter. Two months later the newspapers announced\r\n\r\n      the return on board an English vessel of the Comtesse Octave, restored to\r\n\r\n      her family after adventures by land and sea, invented with sufficient\r\n\r\n      probability to arouse no contradiction.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I moved to Genoa I received a formal announcement of the happy event\r\n\r\n      of the birth of a son to the Count and Countess. I held that letter in my\r\n\r\n      hand for two hours, sitting on this terrace\u2014on this bench. Two\r\n\r\n      months after, urged by Octave, by M. de Grandville, and Monsieur de\r\n\r\n      Serizy, my kind friends, and broken by the death of my uncle, I agreed to\r\n\r\n      take a wife.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSix months after the revolution of July I received this letter, which\r\n\r\n      concludes the story of this couple:\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018MONSIEUR MAURICE,\u2014I am dying though I am a mother\u2014perhaps\r\n\r\n      because I am a mother. I have played my part as a wife well; I have\r\n\r\n      deceived my husband. I have had happiness not less genuine than the tears\r\n\r\n      shed by actresses on the stage. I am dying for society, for the family,\r\n\r\n      for marriage, as the early Christians died for God! I know not of what I\r\n\r\n      am dying, and I am honestly trying to find out, for I am not perverse; but\r\n\r\n      I am bent on explaining my malady to you\u2014you who brought that\r\n\r\n      heavenly physician your uncle, at whose word I surrendered. He was my\r\n\r\n      director; I nursed him in his last illness, and he showed me the way to\r\n\r\n      heaven, bidding me persevere in my duty.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And I have done my duty.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I do not blame those who forget. I admire them as strong and necessary\r\n\r\n      natures; but I have the malady of memory! I have not been able twice to\r\n\r\n      feel that love of the heart which identifies a woman with the man she\r\n\r\n      loves. To the last moment, as you know, I cried to your heart, in the\r\n\r\n      confessional, and to my husband, \u201cHave mercy!\u201d But there was no mercy.\r\n\r\n      Well, and I am dying, dying with stupendous courage. No courtesan was ever\r\n\r\n      more gay than I. My poor Octave is happy; I let his love feed on the\r\n\r\n      illusions of my heart. I throw all my powers into this terrible\r\n\r\n      masquerade; the actress is applauded, feasted, smothered in flowers; but\r\n\r\n      the invisible rival comes every day to seek its prey\u2014a fragment of\r\n\r\n      my life. I am rent and I smile. I smile on two children, but it is the\r\n\r\n      elder, the dead one, that will triumph! I told you so before. The dead\r\n\r\n      child calls me, and I am going to him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The intimacy of marriage without love is a position in which my soul\r\n\r\n      feels degraded every hour. I can never weep or give myself up to dreams\r\n\r\n      but when I am alone. The exigencies of society, the care of my child, and\r\n\r\n      that of Octave\u2019s happiness never leave me a moment to refresh myself, to\r\n\r\n      renew my strength, as I could in my solitude. The incessant need for\r\n\r\n      watchfulness startles my heart with constant alarms. I have not succeeded\r\n\r\n      in implanting in my soul the sharp-eared vigilance that lies with\r\n\r\n      facility, and has the eyes of a lynx. It is not the lip of one I love that\r\n\r\n      drinks my tears and kisses them; my burning eyes are cooled with water,\r\n\r\n      and not with tender lips. It is my soul that acts a part, and that perhaps\r\n\r\n      is why I am dying! I lock up my griefs with so much care that nothing is\r\n\r\n      to be seen of it; it must eat into something, and it has attacked my life.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I said to the doctors, who discovered my secret, \u201cMake me die of some\r\n\r\n      plausible complaint, or I shall drag my husband with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018So it is quite understood by M. Desplein, Bianchon, and myself that I am\r\n\r\n      dying of the softening of some bone which science has fully described.\r\n\r\n      Octave believes that I adore him, do you understand? So I am afraid lest\r\n\r\n      he should follow me. I now write to beg you in that case to be the little\r\n\r\n      Count\u2019s guardian. You will find with this a codicil in which I have\r\n\r\n      expressed my wish; but do not produce it excepting in case of need, for\r\n\r\n      perhaps I am fatuously vain. My devotion may perhaps leave Octave\r\n\r\n      inconsolable but willing to live.\u2014Poor Octave! I wish him a better\r\n\r\n      wife than I am, for he deserves to be well loved.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Since my spiritual spy is married, I bid him remember what the florist\r\n\r\n      of the Rue Saint-Maur hereby bequeaths to him as a lesson: May your wife\r\n\r\n      soon be a mother! Fling her into the vulgarest materialism of household\r\n\r\n      life; hinder her from cherishing in her heart the mysterious flower of the\r\n\r\n      Ideal\u2014of that heavenly perfection in which I believed, that\r\n\r\n      enchanted blossom with glorious colors, and whose perfume disgusts us with\r\n\r\n      reality. I am a Saint-Theresa who has not been suffered to live on ecstasy\r\n\r\n      in the depths of a convent, with the Holy Infant, and a spotless winged\r\n\r\n      angel to come and go as she wished.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You saw me happy among my beloved flowers. I did not tell you all: I saw\r\n\r\n      love budding under your affected madness, and I concealed from you my\r\n\r\n      thoughts, my poetry; I did not admit you to my kingdom of beauty. Well,\r\n\r\n      well; you will love my child for love of me if he should one day lose his\r\n\r\n      poor father. Keep my secrets as the grave will keep them. Do not mourn for\r\n\r\n      me; I have been dead this many a day, if Saint Bernard was right in saying\r\n\r\n      that where there is no more love there is no more life.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the Countess died,\u201d said the Consul, putting away the letters and\r\n\r\n      locking the pocket-book.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs the Count still living?\u201d asked the Ambassador, \u201cfor since the\r\n\r\n      revolution of July he has disappeared from the political stage.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you remember, Monsieur de Lora,\u201d said the Consul-General, \u201chaving seen\r\n\r\n      me going to the steamboat with\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA white-haired man! an old man?\u201d said the painter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn old man of forty-five, going in search of health and amusement in\r\n\r\n      Southern Italy. That old man was my poor friend, my patron, passing\r\n\r\n      through Genoa to take leave of me and place his will in my hands. He\r\n\r\n      appoints me his son\u2019s guardian. I had no occasion to tell him of\r\n\r\n      Honorine\u2019s wishes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoes he suspect himself of murder?\u201d said Mademoiselle des Touches to the\r\n\r\n      Baron de l\u2019Hostal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe suspects the truth,\u201d replied the Consul, \u201cand that is what is killing\r\n\r\n      him. I remained on board the steam packet that was to take him to Naples\r\n\r\n      till it was out of the roadstead; a small boat brought me back. We sat for\r\n\r\n      some little time taking leave of each other\u2014for ever, I fear. God\r\n\r\n      only knows how much we love the confidant of our love when she who\r\n\r\n      inspired it is no more.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That man,\u2019 said Octave, \u2018holds a charm and wears an aureole.\u2019 the Count\r\n\r\n      went to the prow and looked down on the Mediterranean. It happened to be\r\n\r\n      fine, and, moved no doubt by the spectacle, he spoke these last words:\r\n\r\n      \u2018Ought we not, in the interests of human nature, to inquire what is the\r\n\r\n      irresistible power which leads us to sacrifice an exquisite creature to\r\n\r\n      the most fugitive of all pleasures, and in spite of our reason? In my\r\n\r\n      conscience I heard cries. Honorine was not alone in her anguish. And yet I\r\n\r\n      would have it!... I am consumed by remorse. In the Rue Payenne I was dying\r\n\r\n      of the joys I had not; now I shall die in Italy of the joys I have had....\r\n\r\n      Wherein lay the discord between two natures, equally noble, I dare\r\n\r\n      assert?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      For some minutes profound silence reigned on the terrace.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then the Consul, turning to the two women, asked, \u201cWas she virtuous?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle des Touches rose, took the Consul\u2019s arm, went a few steps\r\n\r\n      away, and said to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre not men wrong too when they come to us and make a young girl a wife\r\n\r\n      while cherishing at the bottom of their heart some angelic image, and\r\n\r\n      comparing us to those unknown rivals, to perfections often borrowed from a\r\n\r\n      remembrance, and always finding us wanting?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle, you would be right if marriage were based on passion; and\r\n\r\n      that was the mistake of those two, who will soon be no more. Marriage with\r\n\r\n      heart-deep love on both sides would be Paradise.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle des Touches turned from the Consul, and was immediately\r\n\r\n      joined by Claude Vignon, who said in her ear:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA bit of a coxcomb is M. de l\u2019Hostal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied she, whispering to Claude these words: \u201cfor he has not yet\r\n\r\n      guessed that Honorine would have loved him.\u2014Oh!\u201d she exclaimed,\r\n\r\n      seeing the Consul\u2019s wife approaching, \u201chis wife was listening! Unhappy\r\n\r\n      man!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Eleven was striking by all the clocks, and the guests went home on foot\r\n\r\n      along the seashore.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill, that is not life,\u201d said Mademoiselle des Touches. \u201cThat woman was\r\n\r\n      one of the rarest, and perhaps the most extraordinary exceptions in\r\n\r\n      intellect\u2014a pearl! Life is made up of various incidents, of pain and\r\n\r\n      pleasure alternately. The Paradise of Dante, that sublime expression of\r\n\r\n      the ideal, that perpetual blue, is to be found only in the soul; to ask it\r\n\r\n      of the facts of life is a luxury against which nature protests every hour.\r\n\r\n      To such souls as those the six feet of a cell, and the kneeling chair are\r\n\r\n      all they need.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are right,\u201d said Leon de Lora; \u201cbut good-for-nothing as I may be, I\r\n\r\n      cannot help admiring a woman who is capable, as that one was, of living by\r\n\r\n      the side of a studio, under a painter\u2019s roof, and never coming down, nor\r\n\r\n      seeing the world, nor dipping her feet in the street mud.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSuch a thing has been known\u2014for a few months,\u201d said Claude Vignon,\r\n\r\n      with deep irony.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cComtesse Honorine is not unique of her kind,\u201d replied the Ambassador to\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle des Touches. \u201cA man, nay, and a politician, a bitter writer,\r\n\r\n      was the object of such a passion; and the pistol shot which killed him hit\r\n\r\n      not him alone; the woman who loved lived like a nun ever after.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen there are yet some great souls in this age!\u201d said Camille Maupin,\r\n\r\n      and she stood for some minutes pensively leaning on the balustrade of the\r\n\r\n      quay.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      ADDENDUM\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.

In Which We Begin Not to Understand\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It is not without a certain emotion that I begin to recount here the\r\n\r\n      extraordinary adventures of Joseph Rouletabille. Down to the present time\r\n\r\n      he had so firmly opposed my doing it that I had come to despair of ever\r\n\r\n      publishing the most curious of police stories of the past fifteen years. I\r\n\r\n      had even imagined that the public would never know the whole truth of the\r\n\r\n      prodigious case known as that of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, out of which grew so\r\n\r\n      many mysterious, cruel, and sensational dramas, with which my friend was\r\n\r\n      so closely mixed up, if, propos of a recent nomination of the illustrious\r\n\r\n      Stangerson to the grade of grandcross of the Legion of Honour, an evening\r\n\r\n      journal\u2014in an article, miserable for its ignorance, or audacious for\r\n\r\n      its perfidy\u2014had not resuscitated a terrible adventure of which\r\n\r\n      Joseph Rouletabille had told me he wished to be for ever forgotten.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d! Who now remembers this affair which caused so much ink to\r\n\r\n      flow fifteen years ago? Events are so quickly forgotten in Paris. Has not\r\n\r\n      the very name of the Nayves trial and the tragic history of the death of\r\n\r\n      little Menaldo passed out of mind? And yet the public attention was so\r\n\r\n      deeply interested in the details of the trial that the occurrence of a\r\n\r\n      ministerial crisis was completely unnoticed at the time. Now The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room trial, which, preceded that of the Nayves by some years, made far\r\n\r\n      more noise. The entire world hung for months over this obscure problem\u2014the\r\n\r\n      most obscure, it seems to me, that has ever challenged the perspicacity of\r\n\r\n      our police or taxed the conscience of our judges. The solution of the\r\n\r\n      problem baffled everybody who tried to find it. It was like a dramatic\r\n\r\n      rebus with which old Europe and new America alike became fascinated. That\r\n\r\n      is, in truth\u2014I am permitted to say, because there cannot be any\r\n\r\n      author\u2019s vanity in all this, since I do nothing more than transcribe facts\r\n\r\n      on which an exceptional documentation enables me to throw a new light\u2014that\r\n\r\n      is because, in truth, I do not know that, in the domain of reality or\r\n\r\n      imagination, one can discover or recall to mind anything comparable, in\r\n\r\n      its mystery, with the natural mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      That which nobody could find out, Joseph Rouletabille, aged eighteen, then\r\n\r\n      a reporter engaged on a leading journal, succeeded in discovering. But\r\n\r\n      when, at the Assize Court, he brought in the key to the whole case, he did\r\n\r\n      not tell the whole truth. He only allowed so much of it to appear as\r\n\r\n      sufficed to ensure the acquittal of an innocent man. The reasons which he\r\n\r\n      had for his reticence no longer exist. Better still, the time has come for\r\n\r\n      my friend to speak out fully. You are going to know all; and, without\r\n\r\n      further preamble, I am going to place before your eyes the problem of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room as it was placed before the eyes of the entire world on the\r\n\r\n      day following the enactment of the drama at the Chateau du Glandier.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the 25th of October, 1892, the following note appeared in the latest\r\n\r\n      edition of the \u201cTemps\u201d:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA frightful crime has been committed at the Glandier, on the border of\r\n\r\n      the forest of Sainte-Genevieve, above Epinay-sur-Orge, at the house of\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson. On that night, while the master was working in his\r\n\r\n      laboratory, an attempt was made to assassinate Mademoiselle Stangerson,\r\n\r\n      who was sleeping in a chamber adjoining this laboratory. The doctors do\r\n\r\n      not answer for the life of Mdlle. Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The impression made on Paris by this news may be easily imagined. Already,\r\n\r\n      at that time, the learned world was deeply interested in the labours of\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson and his daughter. These labours\u2014the first that\r\n\r\n      were attempted in radiography\u2014served to open the way for Monsieur\r\n\r\n      and Madame Curie to the discovery of radium. It was expected the Professor\r\n\r\n      would shortly read to the Academy of Sciences a sensational paper on his\r\n\r\n      new theory,\u2014the Dissociation of Matter,\u2014a theory destined to\r\n\r\n      overthrow from its base the whole of official science, which based itself\r\n\r\n      on the principle of the Conservation of Energy. On the following day, the\r\n\r\n      newspapers were full of the tragedy. The \u201cMatin,\u201d among others, published\r\n\r\n      the following article, entitled: \u201cA Supernatural Crime\u201d:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThese are the only details,\u201d wrote the anonymous writer in the \u201cMatin\u201d\u2014\u201cwe\r\n\r\n      have been able to obtain concerning the crime of the Chateau du Glandier.\r\n\r\n      The state of despair in which Professor Stangerson is plunged, and the\r\n\r\n      impossibility of getting any information from the lips of the victim, have\r\n\r\n      rendered our investigations and those of justice so difficult that, at\r\n\r\n      present, we cannot form the least idea of what has passed in The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room in which Mdlle. Stangerson, in her night-dress, was found lying on\r\n\r\n      the floor in the agonies of death. We have, at least, been able to\r\n\r\n      interview Daddy Jacques\u2014as he is called in the country\u2014a old\r\n\r\n      servant in the Stangerson family. Daddy Jacques entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d at the\r\n\r\n      same time as the Professor. This chamber adjoins the laboratory.\r\n\r\n      Laboratory and Yellow Room are in a pavilion at the end of the park, about\r\n\r\n      three hundred metres (a thousand feet) from the chateau.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It was half-past twelve at night,\u2019 this honest old man told us, \u2018and I\r\n\r\n      was in the laboratory, where Monsieur Stangerson was still working, when\r\n\r\n      the thing happened. I had been cleaning and putting instruments in order\r\n\r\n      all the evening and was waiting for Monsieur Stangerson to go to bed.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had worked with her father up to midnight; when\r\n\r\n      the twelve strokes of midnight had sounded by the cuckoo-clock in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory, she rose, kissed Monsieur Stangerson and bade him good-night.\r\n\r\n      To me she said \u201cbon soir, Daddy Jacques\u201d as she passed into The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room. We heard her lock the door and shoot the bolt, so that I could not\r\n\r\n      help laughing, and said to Monsieur: \u201cThere\u2019s Mademoiselle double-locking\r\n\r\n      herself in,\u2014she must be afraid of the \u2018Bete du bon Dieu!\u2019\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n      did not even hear me, he was so deeply absorbed in what he was doing. Just\r\n\r\n      then we heard the distant miawing of a cat. \u201cIs that going to keep us\r\n\r\n      awake all night?\u201d I said to myself; for I must tell you, Monsieur, that,\r\n\r\n      to the end of October, I live in an attic of the pavilion over The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room, so that Mademoiselle should not be left alone through the night in\r\n\r\n      the lonely park. It was the fancy of Mademoiselle to spend the fine\r\n\r\n      weather in the pavilion; no doubt, she found it more cheerful than the\r\n\r\n      chateau and, for the four years it had been built, she had never failed to\r\n\r\n      take up her lodging there in the spring. With the return of winter,\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle returns to the chateau, for there is no fireplace in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018We were staying in the pavilion, then\u2014Monsieur Stangerson and me.\r\n\r\n      We made no noise. He was seated at his desk. As for me, I was sitting on a\r\n\r\n      chair, having finished my work and, looking at him, I said to myself:\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a man!\u2014what intelligence!\u2014what knowledge!\u201d I attach\r\n\r\n      importance to the fact that we made no noise; for, because of that, the\r\n\r\n      assassin certainly thought that we had left the place. And, suddenly,\r\n\r\n      while the cuckoo was sounding the half after midnight, a desperate clamour\r\n\r\n      broke out in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. It was the voice of Mademoiselle, crying\r\n\r\n      \u201cMurder!\u2014murder!\u2014help!\u201d Immediately afterwards revolver shots\r\n\r\n      rang out and there was a great noise of tables and furniture being thrown\r\n\r\n      to the ground, as if in the course of a struggle, and again the voice of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle calling, \u201cMurder!\u2014help!\u2014Papa!\u2014Papa!\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You may be sure that we quickly sprang up and that Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n      and I threw ourselves upon the door. But alas! it was locked, fast locked,\r\n\r\n      on the inside, by the care of Mademoiselle, as I have told you, with key\r\n\r\n      and bolt. We tried to force it open, but it remained firm. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was like a madman, and truly, it was enough to make him one,\r\n\r\n      for we heard Mademoiselle still calling \u201cHelp!\u2014help!\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson showered terrible blows on the door, and wept with rage and\r\n\r\n      sobbed with despair and helplessness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It was then that I had an inspiration. \u201cThe assassin must have entered\r\n\r\n      by the window!\u201d I cried;\u2014\u201cI will go to the window!\u201d and I rushed\r\n\r\n      from the pavilion and ran like one out of his mind.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The inspiration was that the window of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d looks out in such\r\n\r\n      a way that the park wall, which abuts on the pavilion, prevented my at\r\n\r\n      once reaching the window. To get up to it one has first to go out of the\r\n\r\n      park. I ran towards the gate and, on my way, met Bernier and his wife, the\r\n\r\n      gate-keepers, who had been attracted by the pistol reports and by our\r\n\r\n      cries. In a few words I told them what had happened, and directed the\r\n\r\n      concierge to join Monsieur Stangerson with all speed, while his wife came\r\n\r\n      with me to open the park gate. Five minutes later she and I were before\r\n\r\n      the window of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The moon was shining brightly and I saw clearly that no one had touched\r\n\r\n      the window. Not only were the bars that protect it intact, but the blinds\r\n\r\n      inside of them were drawn, as I had myself drawn them early in the\r\n\r\n      evening, as I did every day, though Mademoiselle, knowing that I was tired\r\n\r\n      from the heavy work I had been doing, had begged me not to trouble myself,\r\n\r\n      but leave her to do it; and they were just as I had left them, fastened\r\n\r\n      with an iron catch on the inside. The assassin, therefore, could not have\r\n\r\n      passed either in or out that way; but neither could I get in.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It was unfortunate,\u2014enough to turn one\u2019s brain! The door of the\r\n\r\n      room locked on the inside and the blinds on the only window also fastened\r\n\r\n      on the inside; and Mademoiselle still calling for help!\u2014No! she had\r\n\r\n      ceased to call. She was dead, perhaps. But I still heard her father, in\r\n\r\n      the pavilion, trying to break down the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018With the concierge I hurried back to the pavilion. The door, in spite of\r\n\r\n      the furious attempts of Monsieur Stangerson and Bernier to burst it open,\r\n\r\n      was still holding firm; but at length, it gave way before our united\r\n\r\n      efforts,\u2014and then what a sight met our eyes! I should tell you that,\r\n\r\n      behind us, the concierge held the laboratory lamp\u2014a powerful lamp,\r\n\r\n      that lit the whole chamber.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I must also tell you, monsieur, that \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d is a very small\r\n\r\n      room. Mademoiselle had furnished it with a fairly large iron bedstead, a\r\n\r\n      small table, a night-commode; a dressing-table, and two chairs. By the\r\n\r\n      light of the big lamp we saw all at a glance. Mademoiselle, in her\r\n\r\n      night-dress, was lying on the floor in the midst of the greatest disorder.\r\n\r\n      Tables and chairs had been overthrown, showing that there had been a\r\n\r\n      violent struggle. Mademoiselle had certainly been dragged from her bed.\r\n\r\n      She was covered with blood and had terrible marks of finger-nails on her\r\n\r\n      throat,\u2014the flesh of her neck having been almost torn by the nails.\r\n\r\n      From a wound on the right temple a stream of blood had run down and made a\r\n\r\n      little pool on the floor. When Monsieur Stangerson saw his daughter in\r\n\r\n      that state, he threw himself on his knees beside her, uttering a cry of\r\n\r\n      despair. He ascertained that she still breathed. As to us, we searched for\r\n\r\n      the wretch who had tried to kill our mistress, and I swear to you,\r\n\r\n      monsieur, that, if we had found him, it would have gone hard with him!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But how to explain that he was not there, that he had already escaped?\r\n\r\n      It passes all imagination!\u2014Nobody under the bed, nobody behind the\r\n\r\n      furniture!\u2014All that we discovered were traces, blood-stained marks\r\n\r\n      of a man\u2019s large hand on the walls and on the door; a big handkerchief red\r\n\r\n      with blood, without any initials, an old cap, and many fresh footmarks of\r\n\r\n      a man on the floor,\u2014footmarks of a man with large feet whose\r\n\r\n      boot-soles had left a sort of sooty impression. How had this man got away?\r\n\r\n      How had he vanished? Don\u2019t forget, monsieur, that there is no chimney in\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. He could not have escaped by the door, which is narrow,\r\n\r\n      and on the threshold of which the concierge stood with the lamp, while her\r\n\r\n      husband and I searched for him in every corner of the little room, where\r\n\r\n      it is impossible for anyone to hide himself. The door, which had been\r\n\r\n      forced open against the wall, could not conceal anything behind it, as we\r\n\r\n      assured ourselves. By the window, still in every way secured, no flight\r\n\r\n      had been possible. What then?\u2014I began to believe in the Devil.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But we discovered my revolver on the floor!\u2014Yes, my revolver! Oh!\r\n\r\n      that brought me back to the reality! The Devil would not have needed to\r\n\r\n      steal my revolver to kill Mademoiselle. The man who had been there had\r\n\r\n      first gone up to my attic and taken my revolver from the drawer where I\r\n\r\n      kept it. We then ascertained, by counting the cartridges, that the\r\n\r\n      assassin had fired two shots. Ah! it was fortunate for me that Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was in the laboratory when the affair took place and had seen\r\n\r\n      with his own eyes that I was there with him; for otherwise, with this\r\n\r\n      business of my revolver, I don\u2019t know where we should have been,\u2014I\r\n\r\n      should now be under lock and bar. Justice wants no more to send a man to\r\n\r\n      the scaffold!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The editor of the \u201cMatin\u201d added to this interview the following lines:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have, without interrupting him, allowed Daddy Jacques to recount to us\r\n\r\n      roughly all he knows about the crime of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. We have\r\n\r\n      reproduced it in his own words, only sparing the reader the continual\r\n\r\n      lamentations with which he garnished his narrative. It is quite\r\n\r\n      understood, Daddy Jacques, quite understood, that you are very fond of\r\n\r\n      your masters; and you want them to know it, and never cease repeating it\u2014especially\r\n\r\n      since the discovery of your revolver. It is your right, and we see no harm\r\n\r\n      in it. We should have liked to put some further questions to Daddy Jacques\u2014Jacques\u2014Louis\r\n\r\n      Moustier\u2014but the inquiry of the examining magistrate, which is being\r\n\r\n      carried on at the chateau, makes it impossible for us to gain admission at\r\n\r\n      the Glandier; and, as to the oak wood, it is guarded by a wide circle of\r\n\r\n      policemen, who are jealously watching all traces that can lead to the\r\n\r\n      pavilion, and that may perhaps lead to the discovery of the assassin. \u201cWe\r\n\r\n      have also wished to question the concierges, but they are invisible.\r\n\r\n      Finally, we have waited in a roadside inn, not far from the gate of the\r\n\r\n      chateau, for the departure of Monsieur de Marquet, the magistrate of\r\n\r\n      Corbeil. At half-past five we saw him and his clerk and, before he was\r\n\r\n      able to enter his carriage, had an opportunity to ask him the following\r\n\r\n      question:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Can you, Monsieur de Marquet, give us any information as to this affair,\r\n\r\n      without inconvenience to the course of your inquiry?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It is impossible for us to do it,\u2019 replied Monsieur de Marquet. \u2018I can\r\n\r\n      only say that it is the strangest affair I have ever known. The more we\r\n\r\n      think we know something, the further we are from knowing anything!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe asked Monsieur de Marquet to be good enough to explain his last words;\r\n\r\n      and this is what he said,\u2014the importance of which no one will fail\r\n\r\n      to recognise:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If nothing is added to the material facts so far established, I fear\r\n\r\n      that the mystery which surrounds the abominable crime of which\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson has been the victim will never be brought to\r\n\r\n      light; but it is to be hoped, for the sake of our human reason, that the\r\n\r\n      examination of the walls, and of the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\u2014an\r\n\r\n      examination which I shall to-morrow intrust to the builder who constructed\r\n\r\n      the pavilion four years ago\u2014will afford us the proof that may not\r\n\r\n      discourage us. For the problem is this: we know by what way the assassin\r\n\r\n      gained admission,\u2014he entered by the door and hid himself under the\r\n\r\n      bed, awaiting Mademoiselle Stangerson. But how did he leave? How did he\r\n\r\n      escape? If no trap, no secret door, no hiding place, no opening of any\r\n\r\n      sort is found; if the examination of the walls\u2014even to the\r\n\r\n      demolition of the pavilion\u2014does not reveal any passage practicable\u2014not\r\n\r\n      only for a human being, but for any being whatsoever\u2014if the ceiling\r\n\r\n      shows no crack, if the floor hides no underground passage, one must really\r\n\r\n      believe in the Devil, as Daddy Jacques says!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And the anonymous writer in the \u201cMatin\u201d added in this article\u2014which\r\n\r\n      I have selected as the most interesting of all those that were published\r\n\r\n      on the subject of this affair\u2014that the examining magistrate appeared\r\n\r\n      to place a peculiar significance to the last sentence: \u201cOne must really\r\n\r\n      believe in the Devil, as Jacques says.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The article concluded with these lines: \u201cWe wanted to know what Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques meant by the cry of the Bete Du Bon Dieu.\u201d The landlord of the\r\n\r\n      Donjon Inn explained to us that it is the particularly sinister cry which\r\n\r\n      is uttered sometimes at night by the cat of an old woman,\u2014Mother\r\n\r\n      Angenoux, as she is called in the country. Mother Angenoux is a sort of\r\n\r\n      saint, who lives in a hut in the heart of the forest, not far from the\r\n\r\n      grotto of Sainte-Genevieve.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, the Bete Du Bon Dieu, Mother Angenoux, the Devil,\r\n\r\n      Sainte-Genevieve, Daddy Jacques,\u2014here is a well entangled crime\r\n\r\n      which the stroke of a pickaxe in the wall may disentangle for us\r\n\r\n      to-morrow. Let us at least hope that, for the sake of our human reason, as\r\n\r\n      the examining magistrate says. Meanwhile, it is expected that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2014who has not ceased to be delirious and only pronounces\r\n\r\n      one word distinctly, \u2018Murderer! Murderer!\u2019\u2014will not live through the\r\n\r\n      night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      In conclusion, and at a late hour, the same journal announced that the\r\n\r\n      Chief of the Surete had telegraphed to the famous detective, Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan, who had been sent to London for an affair of stolen securities, to\r\n\r\n      return immediately to Paris.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER II. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears for the First Time\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I remember as well as if it had occurred yesterday, the entry of young\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille into my bedroom that morning. It was about eight o\u2019clock and\r\n\r\n      I was still in bed reading the article in the \u201cMatin\u201d relative to the\r\n\r\n      Glandier crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But, before going further, it is time that I present my friend to the\r\n\r\n      reader.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter. At that\r\n\r\n      time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of\r\n\r\n      examining magistrates, when I had gone to get a \u201cpermit to communicate\u201d\r\n\r\n       for the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare. He had, as they say, \u201ca good\r\n\r\n      nut.\u201d He seemed to have taken his head\u2014round as a bullet\u2014out\r\n\r\n      of a box of marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of\r\n\r\n      the press\u2014all determined billiard-players\u2014had given him that\r\n\r\n      nickname, which was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him. He was\r\n\r\n      always as red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How,\r\n\r\n      while still so young\u2014he was only sixteen and a half years old when I\r\n\r\n      saw him for the first time\u2014had he already won his way on the press?\r\n\r\n      That was what everybody who came into contact with him might have asked,\r\n\r\n      if they had not known his history. At the time of the affair of the woman\r\n\r\n      cut in pieces in the Rue Oberskampf\u2014another forgotten story\u2014he\r\n\r\n      had taken to one of the editors of the \u201cEpoque,\u201d\u2014a paper then\r\n\r\n      rivalling the \u201cMatin\u201d for information,\u2014the left foot, which was\r\n\r\n      missing from the basket in which the gruesome remains were discovered. For\r\n\r\n      this left foot the police had been vainly searching for a week, and young\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had found it in a drain where nobody had thought of looking\r\n\r\n      for it. To do that he had dressed himself as an extra sewer-man, one of a\r\n\r\n      number engaged by the administration of the city of Paris, owing to an\r\n\r\n      overflow of the Seine.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When the editor-in-chief was in possession of the precious foot and\r\n\r\n      informed as to the train of intelligent deductions the boy had been led to\r\n\r\n      make, he was divided between the admiration he felt for such detective\r\n\r\n      cunning in a brain of a lad of sixteen years, and delight at being able to\r\n\r\n      exhibit, in the \u201cmorgue window\u201d of his paper, the left foot of the Rue\r\n\r\n      Oberskampf.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis foot,\u201d he cried, \u201cwill make a great headline.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, when he had confided the gruesome packet to the medical lawyer\r\n\r\n      attached to the journal, he asked the lad, who was shortly to become\r\n\r\n      famous as Rouletabille, what he would expect to earn as a general reporter\r\n\r\n      on the \u201cEpoque\u201d?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwo hundred francs a month,\u201d the youngster replied modestly, hardly able\r\n\r\n      to breathe from surprise at the proposal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou shall have two hundred and fifty,\u201d said the editor-in-chief; \u201conly\r\n\r\n      you must tell everybody that you have been engaged on the paper for a\r\n\r\n      month. Let it be quite understood that it was not you but the \u2018Epoque\u2019\r\n\r\n      that discovered the left foot of the Rue Oberskampf. Here, my young\r\n\r\n      friend, the man is nothing, the paper everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having said this, he begged the new reporter to retire, but before the\r\n\r\n      youth had reached the door he called him back to ask his name. The other\r\n\r\n      replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJoseph Josephine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s not a name,\u201d said the editor-in-chief, \u201cbut since you will not be\r\n\r\n      required to sign what you write it is of no consequence.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The boy-faced reporter speedily made himself many friends, for he was\r\n\r\n      serviceable and gifted with a good humour that enchanted the most\r\n\r\n      severe-tempered and disarmed the most zealous of his companions. At the\r\n\r\n      Bar cafe, where the reporters assembled before going to any of the courts,\r\n\r\n      or to the Prefecture, in search of their news of crime, he began to win a\r\n\r\n      reputation as an unraveller of intricate and obscure affairs which found\r\n\r\n      its way to the office of the Chief of the Surete. When a case was worth\r\n\r\n      the trouble and Rouletabille\u2014he had already been given his nickname\u2014had\r\n\r\n      been started on the scent by his editor-in-chief, he often got the better\r\n\r\n      of the most famous detective.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was at the Bar cafe that I became intimately acquainted with him.\r\n\r\n      Criminal lawyers and journalists are not enemies, the former need\r\n\r\n      advertisement, the latter information. We chatted together, and I soon\r\n\r\n      warmed towards him. His intelligence was so keen, and so original!\u2014and\r\n\r\n      he had a quality of thought such as I have never found in any other\r\n\r\n      person.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Some time after this I was put in charge of the law news of the \u201cCri du\r\n\r\n      Boulevard.\u201d My entry into journalism could not but strengthen the ties\r\n\r\n      which united me to Rouletabille. After a while, my new friend being\r\n\r\n      allowed to carry out an idea of a judicial correspondence column, which he\r\n\r\n      was allowed to sign \u201cBusiness,\u201d in the \u201cEpoque,\u201d I was often able to\r\n\r\n      furnish him with the legal information of which he stood in need.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Nearly two years passed in this way, and the better I knew him, the more I\r\n\r\n      learned to love him; for, in spite of his careless extravagance, I had\r\n\r\n      discovered in him what was, considering his age, an extraordinary\r\n\r\n      seriousness of mind. Accustomed as I was to seeing him gay and, indeed,\r\n\r\n      often too gay, I would many times find him plunged in the deepest\r\n\r\n      melancholy. I tried then to question him as to the cause of this change of\r\n\r\n      humour, but each time he laughed and made me no answer. One day, having\r\n\r\n      questioned him about his parents, of whom he never spoke, he left me,\r\n\r\n      pretending not to have heard what I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      While things were in this state between us, the famous case of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room took place. It was this case which was to rank him as the leading\r\n\r\n      newspaper reporter, and to obtain for him the reputation of being the\r\n\r\n      greatest detective in the world. It should not surprise us to find in the\r\n\r\n      one man the perfection of two such lines of activity if we remember that\r\n\r\n      the daily press was already beginning to transform itself and to become\r\n\r\n      what it is to-day\u2014the gazette of crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Morose-minded people may complain of this; for myself I regard it a matter\r\n\r\n      for congratulation. We can never have too many arms, public or private,\r\n\r\n      against the criminal. To this some people may answer that, by continually\r\n\r\n      publishing the details of crimes, the press ends by encouraging their\r\n\r\n      commission. But then, with some people we can never do right.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, as I have said, entered my room that morning of the 26th of\r\n\r\n      October, 1892. He was looking redder than usual, and his eyes were bulging\r\n\r\n      out of his head, as the phrase is, and altogether he appeared to be in a\r\n\r\n      state of extreme excitement. He waved the \u201cMatin\u201d with a trembling hand,\r\n\r\n      and cried:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, my dear Sainclair,\u2014have you read it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Glandier crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d!\u2014What do you think of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think that it must have been the Devil or the Bete du Bon Dieu that\r\n\r\n      committed the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe serious!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I don\u2019t much believe in murderers* who make their escape through\r\n\r\n      walls of solid brick. I think Daddy Jacques did wrong to leave behind him\r\n\r\n      the weapon with which the crime was committed and, as he occupied the\r\n\r\n      attic immediately above Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room, the builder\u2019s job\r\n\r\n      ordered by the examining magistrate will give us the key of the enigma and\r\n\r\n      it will not be long before we learn by what natural trap, or by what\r\n\r\n      secret door, the old fellow was able to slip in and out, and return\r\n\r\n      immediately to the laboratory to Monsieur Stangerson, without his absence\r\n\r\n      being noticed. That, of course, is only an hypothesis.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille sat down in an armchair, lit his pipe, which he was never\r\n\r\n      without, smoked for a few minutes in silence\u2014no doubt to calm the\r\n\r\n      excitement which, visibly, dominated him\u2014and then replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYoung man,\u201d he said, in a tone the sad irony of which I will not attempt\r\n\r\n      to render, \u201cyoung man, you are a lawyer and I doubt not your ability to\r\n\r\n      save the guilty from conviction; but if you were a magistrate on the\r\n\r\n      bench, how easy it would be for you to condemn innocent persons!\u2014You\r\n\r\n      are really gifted, young man!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He continued to smoke energetically, and then went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo trap will be found, and the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d will become\r\n\r\n      more and more mysterious. That\u2019s why it interests me. The examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate is right; nothing stranger than this crime has ever been\r\n\r\n      known.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you any idea of the way by which the murderer escaped?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone,\u201d replied Rouletabille\u2014\u201cnone, for the present. But I have an\r\n\r\n      idea as to the revolver; the murderer did not use it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood Heavens! By whom, then, was it used?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy\u2014by Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u2014or rather, I have never understood,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs there nothing in this article in the \u2018Matin\u2019 by which you were\r\n\r\n      particularly struck?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing,\u2014I have found the whole of the story it tells equally\r\n\r\n      strange.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, but\u2014the locked door\u2014with the key on the inside?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s the only perfectly natural thing in the whole article.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cReally!\u2014And the bolt?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe bolt?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, the bolt\u2014also inside the room\u2014a still further protection\r\n\r\n      against entry? Mademoiselle Stangerson took quite extraordinary\r\n\r\n      precautions! It is clear to me that she feared someone. That was why she\r\n\r\n      took such precautions\u2014even Daddy Jacques\u2019s revolver\u2014without\r\n\r\n      telling him of it. No doubt she didn\u2019t wish to alarm anybody, and least of\r\n\r\n      all, her father. What she dreaded took place, and she defended herself.\r\n\r\n      There was a struggle, and she used the revolver skilfully enough to wound\r\n\r\n      the assassin in the hand\u2014which explains the impression on the wall\r\n\r\n      and on the door of the large, blood-stained hand of the man who was\r\n\r\n      searching for a means of exit from the chamber. But she didn\u2019t fire soon\r\n\r\n      enough to avoid the terrible blow on the right temple.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen the wound on the temple was not done with the revolver?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe paper doesn\u2019t say it was, and I don\u2019t think it was; because logically\r\n\r\n      it appears to me that the revolver was used by Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      against the assassin. Now, what weapon did the murderer use? The blow on\r\n\r\n      the temple seems to show that the murderer wished to stun Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson,\u2014after he had unsuccessfully tried to strangle her. He\r\n\r\n      must have known that the attic was inhabited by Daddy Jacques, and that\r\n\r\n      was one of the reasons, I think, why he must have used a quiet weapon,\u2014a\r\n\r\n      life-preserver, or a hammer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll that doesn\u2019t explain how the murderer got out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d I\r\n\r\n      observed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently,\u201d replied Rouletabille, rising, \u201cand that is what has to be\r\n\r\n      explained. I am going to the Chateau du Glandier, and have come to see\r\n\r\n      whether you will go with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI?\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, my boy. I want you. The \u2018Epoque\u2019 has definitely entrusted this case\r\n\r\n      to me, and I must clear it up as quickly as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut in what way can I be of any use to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Robert Darzac is at the Chateau du Glandier.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s true. His despair must be boundless.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI must have a talk with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille said it in a tone that surprised me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it because\u2014you think there is something to be got out of him?\u201d I\r\n\r\n      asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That was all he would say. He retired to my sitting-room, begging me to\r\n\r\n      dress quickly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I knew Monsieur Robert Darzac from having been of great service to him in\r\n\r\n      a civil action, while I was acting as secretary to Maitre Barbet Delatour.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was at that time about forty years of age, was\r\n\r\n      a professor of physics at the Sorbonne. He was intimately acquainted with\r\n\r\n      the Stangersons, and, after an assiduous seven years\u2019 courtship of the\r\n\r\n      daughter, had been on the point of marrying her. In spite of the fact that\r\n\r\n      she has become, as the phrase goes, \u201ca person of a certain age,\u201d she was\r\n\r\n      still remarkably good-looking. While I was dressing I called out to\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, who was impatiently moving about my sitting-room:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you any idea as to the murderer\u2019s station in life?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he replied; \u201cI think if he isn\u2019t a man in society, he is, at least,\r\n\r\n      a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again, is only an\r\n\r\n      impression.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat has led you to form it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u2014the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks of the\r\n\r\n      rough boots on the floor,\u201d he replied.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI understand,\u201d I said; \u201cmurderers don\u2019t leave traces behind them which\r\n\r\n      tell the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sainclair,\u201d concluded\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER III. \u201cA Man Has Passed Like a Shadow Through the Blinds\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Half an hour later Rouletabille and I were on the platform of the Orleans\r\n\r\n      station, awaiting the departure of the train which was to take us to\r\n\r\n      Epinay-sur-Orge.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the platform we found Monsieur de Marquet and his Registrar, who\r\n\r\n      represented the Judicial Court of Corbeil. Monsieur Marquet had spent the\r\n\r\n      night in Paris, attending the final rehearsal, at the Scala, of a little\r\n\r\n      play of which he was the unknown author, signing himself simply \u201cCastigat\r\n\r\n      Ridendo.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet was beginning to be a \u201cnoble old gentleman.\u201d Generally\r\n\r\n      he was extremely polite and full of gay humour, and in all his life had\r\n\r\n      had but one passion,\u2014that of dramatic art. Throughout his\r\n\r\n      magisterial career he was interested solely in cases capable of furnishing\r\n\r\n      him with something in the nature of a drama. Though he might very well\r\n\r\n      have aspired to the highest judicial positions, he had never really worked\r\n\r\n      for anything but to win a success at the romantic Porte-Saint-Martin, or\r\n\r\n      at the sombre Odeon.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Because of the mystery which shrouded it, the case of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n      certain to fascinate so theatrical a mind. It interested him enormously,\r\n\r\n      and he threw himself into it, less as a magistrate eager to know the\r\n\r\n      truth, than as an amateur of dramatic embroglios, tending wholly to\r\n\r\n      mystery and intrigue, who dreads nothing so much as the explanatory final\r\n\r\n      act.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      So that, at the moment of meeting him, I heard Monsieur de Marquet say to\r\n\r\n      the Registrar with a sigh:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope, my dear Monsieur Maleine, this builder with his pickaxe will not\r\n\r\n      destroy so fine a mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave no fear,\u201d replied Monsieur Maleine, \u201chis pickaxe may demolish the\r\n\r\n      pavilion, perhaps, but it will leave our case intact. I have sounded the\r\n\r\n      walls and examined the ceiling and floor and I know all about it. I am not\r\n\r\n      to be deceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having thus reassured his chief, Monsieur Maleine, with a discreet\r\n\r\n      movement of the head, drew Monsieur de Marquet\u2019s attention to us. The face\r\n\r\n      of that gentleman clouded, and, as he saw Rouletabille approaching, hat in\r\n\r\n      hand, he sprang into one of the empty carriages saying, half aloud to his\r\n\r\n      Registrar, as he did so, \u201cAbove all, no journalists!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Maleine replied in the same tone, \u201cI understand!\u201d and then tried\r\n\r\n      to prevent Rouletabille from entering the same compartment with the\r\n\r\n      examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcuse me, gentlemen,\u2014this compartment is reserved.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am a journalist, Monsieur, engaged on the \u2018Epoque,\u2019\u201d said my young\r\n\r\n      friend with a great show of gesture and politeness, \u201cand I have a word or\r\n\r\n      two to say to Monsieur de Marquet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur is very much engaged with the inquiry he has in hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! his inquiry, pray believe me, is absolutely a matter of indifference\r\n\r\n      to me. I am no scavenger of odds and ends,\u201d he went on, with infinite\r\n\r\n      contempt in his lower lip, \u201cI am a theatrical reporter; and this evening I\r\n\r\n      shall have to give a little account of the play at the Scala.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGet in, sir, please,\u201d said the Registrar.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was already in the compartment. I went in after him and\r\n\r\n      seated myself by his side. The Registrar followed and closed the carriage\r\n\r\n      door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet looked at him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, sir,\u201d Rouletabille began, \u201cYou must not be angry with Monsieur de\r\n\r\n      Maleine. It is not with Monsieur de Marquet that I desire to have the\r\n\r\n      honour of speaking, but with Monsieur \u2018Castigat Ridendo.\u2019 Permit me to\r\n\r\n      congratulate you\u2014personally, as well as the writer for the\r\n\r\n      \u2018Epoque.\u2019\u201d And Rouletabille, having first introduced me, introduced\r\n\r\n      himself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet, with a nervous gesture, caressed his beard into a\r\n\r\n      point, and explained to Rouletabille, in a few words, that he was too\r\n\r\n      modest an author to desire that the veil of his pseudonym should be\r\n\r\n      publicly raised, and that he hoped the enthusiasm of the journalist for\r\n\r\n      the dramatist\u2019s work would not lead him to tell the public that Monsieur\r\n\r\n      \u201cCastigat Ridendo\u201d and the examining magistrate of Corbeil were one and\r\n\r\n      the same person.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe work of the dramatic author may interfere,\u201d he said, after a slight\r\n\r\n      hesitation, \u201cwith that of the magistrate, especially in a province where\r\n\r\n      one\u2019s labours are little more than routine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, you may rely on my discretion!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The train was in motion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have started!\u201d said the examining magistrate, surprised at seeing us\r\n\r\n      still in the carriage.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u2014truth has started,\u201d said Rouletabile, smiling\r\n\r\n      amiably,\u2014\u201con its way to the Chateau du Glandier. A fine case,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet,\u2014a fine case!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn obscure\u2014incredible, unfathomable, inexplicable affair\u2014and\r\n\r\n      there is only one thing I fear, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u2014that the\r\n\r\n      journalists will be trying to explain it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend felt this a rap on his knuckles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he said simply, \u201cthat is to be feared. They meddle in everything.\r\n\r\n      As for my interest, monsieur, I only referred to it by mere chance,\u2014the\r\n\r\n      mere chance of finding myself in the same train with you, and in the same\r\n\r\n      compartment of the same carriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere are you going, then?\u201d asked Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo the Chateau du Glandier,\u201d replied Rouletabille, without turning.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll not get in, Monsieur Rouletabille!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWill you prevent me?\u201d said my friend, already prepared to fight.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot I!\u2014I like the press and journalists too well to be in any way\r\n\r\n      disagreeable to them; but Monsieur Stangerson has given orders for his\r\n\r\n      door to be closed against everybody, and it is well guarded. Not a\r\n\r\n      journalist was able to pass through the gate of the Glandier yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet compressed his lips and seemed ready to relapse into\r\n\r\n      obstinate silence. He only relaxed a little when Rouletabille no longer\r\n\r\n      left him in ignorance of the fact that we were going to the Glandier for\r\n\r\n      the purpose of shaking hands with an \u201cold and intimate friend,\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac\u2014a man whom Rouletabille had perhaps seen once in his\r\n\r\n      life.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPoor Robert!\u201d continued the young reporter, \u201cthis dreadful affair may be\r\n\r\n      his death,\u2014he is so deeply in love with Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis sufferings are truly painful to witness,\u201d escaped like a regret from\r\n\r\n      the lips of Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s life will be saved.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet us hope so. Her father told me yesterday that, if she does not\r\n\r\n      recover, it will not be long before he joins her in the grave. What an\r\n\r\n      incalculable loss to science his death would be!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe wound on her temple is serious, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently; but, by a wonderful chance, it has not proved mortal. The blow\r\n\r\n      was given with great force.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen it was not with the revolver she was wounded,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      glancing at me in triumph.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet appeared greatly embarrassed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything\u2014I don\u2019t want to say anything\u2014I will not\r\n\r\n      say anything,\u201d he said. And he turned towards his Registrar as if he no\r\n\r\n      longer knew us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Rouletabille was not to be so easily shaken off. He moved nearer to\r\n\r\n      the examining magistrate and, drawing a copy of the \u201cMatin\u201d from his\r\n\r\n      pocket, he showed it to him and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is one thing, Monsieur, which I may enquire of you without\r\n\r\n      committing an indiscretion. You have, of course, seen the account given in\r\n\r\n      the \u2018Matin\u2019? It is absurd, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot in the slightest, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d has but one barred window\u2014the bars of which\r\n\r\n      have not been moved\u2014and only one door, which had to be broken open\u2014and\r\n\r\n      the assassin was not found!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s so, monsieur,\u2014that\u2019s so. That\u2019s how the matter stands.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille said no more but plunged into thought. A quarter of an hour\r\n\r\n      thus passed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Coming back to himself again he said, addressing the magistrate:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow did Mademoiselle Stangerson wear her hair on that evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a very important point,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cHer hair was done up\r\n\r\n      in bands, wasn\u2019t it? I feel sure that on that evening, the evening of the\r\n\r\n      crime, she had her hair arranged in bands.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you are mistaken, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d replied the magistrate;\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson that evening had her hair drawn up in a knot on\r\n\r\n      the top of her head,\u2014her usual way of arranging it\u2014her\r\n\r\n      forehead completely uncovered. I can assure you, for we have carefully\r\n\r\n      examined the wound. There was no blood on the hair, and the arrangement of\r\n\r\n      it has not been disturbed since the crime was committed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are sure! You are sure that, on the night of the crime, she had not\r\n\r\n      her hair in bands?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite sure,\u201d the magistrate continued, smiling, \u201cbecause I remember the\r\n\r\n      Doctor saying to me, while he was examining the wound, \u2018It is a great pity\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson was in the habit of drawing her hair back from her\r\n\r\n      forehead. If she had worn it in bands, the blow she received on the temple\r\n\r\n      would have been weakened.\u2019 It seems strange to me that you should attach\r\n\r\n      so much importance to this point.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! if she had not her hair in bands, I give it up,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      with a despairing gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd was the wound on her temple a bad one?\u201d he asked presently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTerrible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith what weapon was it made?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is a secret of the investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you found the weapon\u2014whatever it was?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The magistrate did not answer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the wound in the throat?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the examining magistrate readily confirmed the decision of the doctor\r\n\r\n      that, if the murderer had pressed her throat a few seconds longer,\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson would have died of strangulation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe affair as reported in the \u2018Matin,\u2019\u201d said Rouletabille eagerly, \u201cseems\r\n\r\n      to me more and more inexplicable. Can you tell me, Monsieur, how many\r\n\r\n      openings there are in the pavilion? I mean doors and windows.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are five,\u201d replied Monsieur de Marquet, after having coughed once\r\n\r\n      or twice, but no longer resisting the desire he felt to talk of the whole\r\n\r\n      of the incredible mystery of the affair he was investigating. \u201cThere are\r\n\r\n      five, of which the door of the vestibule is the only entrance to the\r\n\r\n      pavilion,\u2014a door always automatically closed, which cannot be\r\n\r\n      opened, either from the outer or inside, except with the two special keys\r\n\r\n      which are never out of the possession of either Daddy Jacques or Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. Mademoiselle Stangerson had no need for one, since Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques lodged in the pavilion and because, during the daytime, she never\r\n\r\n      left her father. When they, all four, rushed into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, after\r\n\r\n      breaking open the door of the laboratory, the door in the vestibule\r\n\r\n      remained closed as usual and, of the two keys for opening it, Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques had one in his pocket, and Monsieur Stangerson the other. As to\r\n\r\n      the windows of the pavilion, there are four; the one window of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room and those of the laboratory looking out on to the country; the window\r\n\r\n      in the vestibule looking into the park.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is by that window that he escaped from the pavilion!\u201d cried\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d demanded Monsieur de Marquet, fixing a strange\r\n\r\n      look on my young friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe\u2019ll see later how he got away from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d replied\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, \u201cbut he must have left the pavilion by the vestibule\r\n\r\n      window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOnce more,\u2014how do you know that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow? Oh, the thing is simple enough! As soon as he found he could not\r\n\r\n      escape by the door of the pavilion his only way out was by the window in\r\n\r\n      the vestibule, unless he could pass through a grated window. The window of\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d is secured by iron bars, because it looks out upon the\r\n\r\n      open country; the two windows of the laboratory have to be protected in\r\n\r\n      like manner for the same reason. As the murderer got away, I conceive that\r\n\r\n      he found a window that was not barred,\u2014that of the vestibule, which\r\n\r\n      opens on to the park,\u2014that is to say, into the interior of the\r\n\r\n      estate. There\u2019s not much magic in all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet, \u201cbut what you have not guessed is that\r\n\r\n      this single window in the vestibule, though it has no iron bars, has solid\r\n\r\n      iron blinds. Now these iron blinds have remained fastened by their iron\r\n\r\n      latch; and yet we have proof that the murderer made his escape from the\r\n\r\n      pavilion by that window! Traces of blood on the inside wall and on the\r\n\r\n      blinds as well as on the floor, and footmarks, of which I have taken the\r\n\r\n      measurements, attest the fact that the murderer made his escape that way.\r\n\r\n      But then, how did he do it, seeing that the blinds remained fastened on\r\n\r\n      the inside? He passed through them like a shadow. But what is more\r\n\r\n      bewildering than all is that it is impossible to form any idea as to how\r\n\r\n      the murderer got out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, or how he got across the\r\n\r\n      laboratory to reach the vestibule! Ah, yes, Monsieur Rouletabille, it is\r\n\r\n      altogether as you said, a fine case, the key to which will not be\r\n\r\n      discovered for a long time, I hope.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou hope, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet corrected himself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not hope so,\u2014I think so.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCould that window have been closed and refastened after the flight of the\r\n\r\n      assassin?\u201d asked Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is what occurred to me for a moment; but it would imply an\r\n\r\n      accomplice or accomplices,\u2014and I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      After a short silence he added:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh\u2014if Mademoiselle Stangerson were only well enough to-day to be\r\n\r\n      questioned!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille following up his thought, asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the attic?\u2014There must be some opening to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; there is a window, or rather skylight, in it, which, as it looks out\r\n\r\n      towards the country, Monsieur Stangerson has had barred, like the rest of\r\n\r\n      the windows. These bars, as in the other windows, have remained intact,\r\n\r\n      and the blinds, which naturally open inwards, have not been unfastened.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, we have not discovered anything to lead us to suspect that\r\n\r\n      the murderer had passed through the attic.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems clear to you, then, Monsieur, that the murderer escaped\u2014nobody\r\n\r\n      knows how\u2014by the window in the vestibule?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything goes to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think so, too,\u201d confessed Rouletabille gravely.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      After a brief silence, he continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you have not found any traces of the murderer in the attic, such as\r\n\r\n      the dirty footmarks similar to those on the floor of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, you\r\n\r\n      must come to the conclusion that it was not he who stole Daddy Jacques\u2019s\r\n\r\n      revolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are no footmarks in the attic other than those of Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      himself,\u201d said the magistrate with a significant turn of his head. Then,\r\n\r\n      after an apparent decision, he added: \u201cDaddy Jacques was with Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson in the laboratory\u2014and it was lucky for him he was.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen what part did his revolver play in the tragedy?\u2014It seems very\r\n\r\n      clear that this weapon did less harm to Mademoiselle Stangerson than it\r\n\r\n      did to the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The magistrate made no reply to this question, which doubtless embarrassed\r\n\r\n      him. \u201cMonsieur Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201ctells us that the two bullets have\r\n\r\n      been found in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, one embedded in the wall stained with the\r\n\r\n      impression of a red hand\u2014a man\u2019s large hand\u2014and the other in\r\n\r\n      the ceiling.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! oh! in the ceiling!\u201d muttered Rouletabille. \u201cIn the ceiling! That\u2019s\r\n\r\n      very curious!\u2014In the ceiling!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He puffed awhile in silence at his pipe, enveloping himself in the smoke.\r\n\r\n      When we reached Savigny-sur-Orge, I had to tap him on the shoulder to\r\n\r\n      arouse him from his dream and come out on to the platform of the station.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      There, the magistrate and his Registrar bowed to us, and by rapidly\r\n\r\n      getting into a cab that was awaiting them, made us understand that they\r\n\r\n      had seen enough of us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow long will it take to walk to the Chateau du Glandier?\u201d Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      asked one of the railway porters.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn hour and a half or an hour and three quarters\u2014easy walking,\u201d the\r\n\r\n      man replied.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked up at the sky and, no doubt, finding its appearance\r\n\r\n      satisfactory, took my arm and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome on!\u2014I need a walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre things getting less entangled?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot a bit of it!\u201d he said, \u201cmore entangled than ever! It\u2019s true, I have\r\n\r\n      an idea\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it is just at present\u2014it\u2019s an idea involving\r\n\r\n      the life or death of two persons at least.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think there were accomplices?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We fell into silence. Presently he went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was a bit of luck, our falling in with that examining magistrate and\r\n\r\n      his Registrar, eh? What did I tell you about that revolver?\u201d His head was\r\n\r\n      bent down, he had his hands in his pockets, and he was whistling. After a\r\n\r\n      while I heard him murmur:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPoor woman!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it Mademoiselle Stangerson you are pitying?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; she\u2019s a noble woman and worthy of being pitied!\u2014a woman of a\r\n\r\n      great, a very great character\u2014I imagine\u2014I imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know her then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot at all. I have never seen her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, then, do you say that she is a woman of great character?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause she bravely faced the murderer; because she courageously defended\r\n\r\n      herself\u2014and, above all, because of the bullet in the ceiling.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I looked at Rouletabille and inwardly wondered whether he was not mocking\r\n\r\n      me, or whether he had not suddenly gone out of his senses. But I saw that\r\n\r\n      he had never been less inclined to laugh, and the brightness of his keenly\r\n\r\n      intelligent eyes assured me that he retained all his reason. Then, too, I\r\n\r\n      was used to his broken way of talking, which only left me puzzled as to\r\n\r\n      his meaning, till, with a very few clear, rapidly uttered words, he would\r\n\r\n      make the drift of his ideas clear to me, and I saw that what he had\r\n\r\n      previously said, and which had appeared to me void of meaning, was so\r\n\r\n      thoroughly logical that I could not understand how it was I had not\r\n\r\n      understood him sooner.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER IV. \u201cIn the Bosom of Wild Nature\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Chateau du Glandier is one of the oldest chateaux in the Ile de\r\n\r\n      France, where so many building remains of the feudal period are still\r\n\r\n      standing. Built originally in the heart of the forest, in the reign of\r\n\r\n      Philip le Bel, it now could be seen a few hundred yards from the road\r\n\r\n      leading from the village of Sainte-Genevieve to Monthery. A mass of\r\n\r\n      inharmonious structures, it is dominated by a donjon. When the visitor has\r\n\r\n      mounted the crumbling steps of this ancient donjon, he reaches a little\r\n\r\n      plateau where, in the seventeenth century, Georges Philibert de Sequigny,\r\n\r\n      Lord of the Glandier, Maisons-Neuves and other places, built the existing\r\n\r\n      town in an abominably rococo style of architecture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was in this place, seemingly belonging entirely to the past, that\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson and his daughter installed themselves to lay the\r\n\r\n      foundations for the science of the future. Its solitude, in the depths of\r\n\r\n      woods, was what, more than all, had pleased them. They would have none to\r\n\r\n      witness their labours and intrude on their hopes, but the aged stones and\r\n\r\n      grand old oaks. The Glandier\u2014ancient Glandierum\u2014was so called\r\n\r\n      from the quantity of glands (acorns) which, in all times, had been\r\n\r\n      gathered in that neighbourhood. This land, of present mournful interest,\r\n\r\n      had fallen back, owing to the negligence or abandonment of its owners,\r\n\r\n      into the wild character of primitive nature. The buildings alone, which\r\n\r\n      were hidden there, had preserved traces of their strange metamorphoses.\r\n\r\n      Every age had left on them its imprint; a bit of architecture with which\r\n\r\n      was bound up the remembrance of some terrible event, some bloody\r\n\r\n      adventure. Such was the chateau in which science had taken refuge\u2014a\r\n\r\n      place seemingly designed to be the theatre of mysteries, terror, and\r\n\r\n      death.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having explained so far, I cannot refrain from making one further\r\n\r\n      reflection. If I have lingered a little over this description of the\r\n\r\n      Glandier, it is not because I have reached the right moment for creating\r\n\r\n      the necessary atmosphere for the unfolding of the tragedy before the eyes\r\n\r\n      of the reader. Indeed, in all this matter, my first care will be to be as\r\n\r\n      simple as is possible. I have no ambition to be an author. An author is\r\n\r\n      always something of a romancer, and God knows, the mystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room is quite full enough of real tragic horror to require no aid from\r\n\r\n      literary effects. I am, and only desire to be, a faithful \u201creporter.\u201d My\r\n\r\n      duty is to report the event; and I place the event in its frame\u2014that\r\n\r\n      is all. It is only natural that you should know where the things happened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I return to Monsieur Stangerson. When he bought the estate, fifteen years\r\n\r\n      before the tragedy with which we are engaged occurred, the Chateau du\r\n\r\n      Glandier had for a long time been unoccupied. Another old chateau in the\r\n\r\n      neighbourhood, built in the fourteenth century by Jean de Belmont, was\r\n\r\n      also abandoned, so that that part of the country was very little\r\n\r\n      inhabited. Some small houses on the side of the road leading to Corbeil,\r\n\r\n      an inn, called the \u201cAuberge du Donjon,\u201d which offered passing hospitality\r\n\r\n      to waggoners; these were about all to represent civilisation in this\r\n\r\n      out-of-the-way part of the country, but a few leagues from the capital.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But this deserted condition of the place had been the determining reason\r\n\r\n      for the choice made by Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was already celebrated. He had returned from America, where his\r\n\r\n      works had made a great stir. The book which he had published at\r\n\r\n      Philadelphia, on the \u201cDissociation of Matter by Electric Action,\u201d had\r\n\r\n      aroused opposition throughout the whole scientific world. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was a Frenchman, but of American origin. Important matters\r\n\r\n      relating to a legacy had kept him for several years in the United States,\r\n\r\n      where he had continued the work begun by him in France, whither he had\r\n\r\n      returned in possession of a large fortune. This fortune was a great boon\r\n\r\n      to him; for, though he might have made millions of dollars by exploiting\r\n\r\n      two or three of his chemical discoveries relative to new processes of\r\n\r\n      dyeing, it was always repugnant to him to use for his own private gain the\r\n\r\n      wonderful gift of invention he had received from nature. He considered he\r\n\r\n      owed it to mankind, and all that his genius brought into the world went,\r\n\r\n      by this philosophical view of his duty, into the public lap.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      If he did not try to conceal his satisfaction at coming into possession of\r\n\r\n      this fortune, which enabled him to give himself up to his passion for pure\r\n\r\n      science, he had equally to rejoice, it seemed to him, for another cause.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson was, at the time when her father returned from\r\n\r\n      America and bought the Glandier estate, twenty years of age. She was\r\n\r\n      exceedingly pretty, having at once the Parisian grace of her mother, who\r\n\r\n      had died in giving her birth, and all the splendour, all the riches of the\r\n\r\n      young American blood of her parental grandfather, William Stangerson. A\r\n\r\n      citizen of Philadelphia, William Stangerson had been obliged to become\r\n\r\n      naturalised in obedience to family exigencies at the time of his marriage\r\n\r\n      with a French lady, she who was to be the mother of the illustrious\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. In that way the professor\u2019s French nationality is accounted\r\n\r\n      for.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Twenty years of age, a charming blonde, with blue eyes, milk-white\r\n\r\n      complexion, and radiant with divine health, Mathilde Stangerson was one of\r\n\r\n      the most beautiful marriageable girls in either the old or the new world.\r\n\r\n      It was her father\u2019s duty, in spite of the inevitable pain which a\r\n\r\n      separation from her would cause him, to think of her marriage; and he was\r\n\r\n      fully prepared for it. Nevertheless, he buried himself and his child at\r\n\r\n      the Glandier at the moment when his friends were expecting him to bring\r\n\r\n      her out into society. Some of them expressed their astonishment, and to\r\n\r\n      their questions he answered: \u201cIt is my daughter\u2019s wish. I can refuse her\r\n\r\n      nothing. She has chosen the Glandier.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Interrogated in her turn, the young girl replied calmly: \u201cWhere could we\r\n\r\n      work better than in this solitude?\u201d For Mademoiselle Stangerson had\r\n\r\n      already begun to collaborate with her father in his work. It could not at\r\n\r\n      the time be imagined that her passion for science would lead her so far as\r\n\r\n      to refuse all the suitors who presented themselves to her for over fifteen\r\n\r\n      years. So secluded was the life led by the two, father and daughter, that\r\n\r\n      they showed themselves only at a few official receptions and, at certain\r\n\r\n      times in the year, in two or three friendly drawing-rooms, where the fame\r\n\r\n      of the professor and the beauty of Mathilde made a sensation. The young\r\n\r\n      girl\u2019s extreme reserve did not at first discourage suitors; but at the end\r\n\r\n      of a few years, they tired of their quest.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      One alone persisted with tender tenacity and deserved the name of \u201ceternal\r\n\r\n      fiance,\u201d a name he accepted with melancholy resignation; that was Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac. Mademoiselle Stangerson was now no longer young, and it\r\n\r\n      seemed that, having found no reason for marrying at five-and-thirty, she\r\n\r\n      would never find one. But such an argument evidently found no acceptance\r\n\r\n      with Monsieur Robert Darzac. He continued to pay his court\u2014if the\r\n\r\n      delicate and tender attention with which he ceaselessly surrounded this\r\n\r\n      woman of five-and-thirty could be called courtship\u2014in face of her\r\n\r\n      declared intention never to marry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly, some weeks before the events with which we are occupied, a\r\n\r\n      report\u2014to which nobody attached any importance, so incredible did it\r\n\r\n      sound\u2014was spread about Paris, that Mademoiselle Stangerson had at\r\n\r\n      last consented to \u201ccrown\u201d the inextinguishable flame of Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac! It needed that Monsieur Robert Darzac himself should not deny this\r\n\r\n      matrimonial rumour to give it an appearance of truth, so unlikely did it\r\n\r\n      seem to be well founded. One day, however, Monsieur Stangerson, as he was\r\n\r\n      leaving the Academy of Science, announced that the marriage of his\r\n\r\n      daughter and Monsieur Robert Darzac would be celebrated in the privacy of\r\n\r\n      the Chateau du Glandier, as soon as he and his daughter had put the\r\n\r\n      finishing touches to their report summing up their labours on the\r\n\r\n      \u201cDissociation of Matter.\u201d The new household would install itself in the\r\n\r\n      Glandier, and the son-in-law would lend his assistance in the work to\r\n\r\n      which the father and daughter had dedicated their lives.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The scientific world had barely had time to recover from the effect of\r\n\r\n      this news, when it learned of the attempted assassination of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      under the extraordinary conditions which we have detailed and which our\r\n\r\n      visit to the chateau was to enable us to ascertain with yet greater\r\n\r\n      precision. I have not hesitated to furnish the reader with all these\r\n\r\n      retrospective details, known to me through my business relations with\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac. On crossing the threshold of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d he\r\n\r\n      was as well posted as I was.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER V. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Makes a Remark to Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac Which Produces Its Little Effect\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and I had been walking for several minutes, by the side of a\r\n\r\n      long wall bounding the vast property of Monsieur Stangerson and had\r\n\r\n      already come within sight of the entrance gate, when our attention was\r\n\r\n      drawn to an individual who, half bent to the ground, seemed to be so\r\n\r\n      completely absorbed in what he was doing as not to have seen us coming\r\n\r\n      towards him. At one time he stooped so low as almost to touch the ground;\r\n\r\n      at another he drew himself up and attentively examined the wall; then he\r\n\r\n      looked into the palm of one of his hands, and walked away with rapid\r\n\r\n      strides. Finally he set off running, still looking into the palm of his\r\n\r\n      hand. Rouletabille had brought me to a standstill by a gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHush! Frederic Larsan is at work! Don\u2019t let us disturb him!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had a great admiration for the celebrated detective. I had\r\n\r\n      never before seen him, but I knew him well by reputation. At that time,\r\n\r\n      before Rouletabille had given proof of his unique talent, Larsan was\r\n\r\n      reputed as the most skilful unraveller of the most mysterious and\r\n\r\n      complicated crimes. His reputation was world-wide, and the police of\r\n\r\n      London, and even of America, often called him in to their aid when their\r\n\r\n      own national inspectors and detectives found themselves at the end of\r\n\r\n      their wits and resources.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      No one was astonished, then, that the head of the Surete had, at the\r\n\r\n      outset of the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, telegraphed his precious\r\n\r\n      subordinate to London, where he had been sent on a big case of stolen\r\n\r\n      securities, to return with all haste. Frederic who, at the Surete, was\r\n\r\n      called the \u201cgreat Frederic,\u201d had made all speed, doubtless knowing by\r\n\r\n      experience that, if he was interrupted in what he was doing, it was\r\n\r\n      because his services were urgently needed in another direction; so, as\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille said, he was that morning already \u201cat work.\u201d We soon found\r\n\r\n      out in what it consisted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      What he was continually looking at in the palm of his right hand was\r\n\r\n      nothing but his watch, the minute hand of which he appeared to be noting\r\n\r\n      intently. Then he turned back still running, stopping only when he reached\r\n\r\n      the park gate, where he again consulted his watch and then put it away in\r\n\r\n      his pocket, shrugging his shoulders with a gesture of discouragement. He\r\n\r\n      pushed open the park gate, reclosed and locked it, raised his head and,\r\n\r\n      through the bars, perceived us. Rouletabille rushed after him, and I\r\n\r\n      followed. Frederic Larsan waited for us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Fred,\u201d said Rouletabille, raising his hat and showing the\r\n\r\n      profound respect, based on admiration, which the young reporter felt for\r\n\r\n      the celebrated detective, \u201ccan you tell me whether Monsieur Robert Darzac\r\n\r\n      is at the chateau at this moment? Here is one of his friends, of the Paris\r\n\r\n      Bar, who desires to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI really don\u2019t know, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d replied Fred, shaking hands\r\n\r\n      with my friend, whom he had several times met in the course of his\r\n\r\n      difficult investigations. \u201cI have not seen him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe concierges will be able to inform us no doubt?\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      pointing to the lodge the door and windows of which were close shut.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe concierges will not be able to give you any information, Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause they were arrested half an hour ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cArrested!\u201d cried Rouletabille; \u201cthen they are the murderers!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen you can\u2019t arrest the real murderer,\u201d he said with an air of supreme\r\n\r\n      irony, \u201cyou can always indulge in the luxury of discovering accomplices.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you have them arrested, Monsieur Fred?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot I!\u2014I haven\u2019t had them arrested. In the first place, I am pretty\r\n\r\n      sure that they have not had anything to do with the affair, and then\r\n\r\n      because\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause of what?\u201d asked Rouletabille eagerly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause of nothing,\u201d said Larsan, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause there were no accomplices!\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAha!\u2014you have an idea, then, about this matter?\u201d said Larsan,\r\n\r\n      looking at Rouletabille intently, \u201cyet you have seen nothing, young man\u2014you\r\n\r\n      have not yet gained admission here!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall get admission.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI doubt it. The orders are strict.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall gain admission, if you let me see Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do that\r\n\r\n      for me. You know we are old friends. I beg of you, Monsieur Fred. Do you\r\n\r\n      remember the article I wrote about you on the gold bar case?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The face of Rouletabille at the moment was really funny to look at. It\r\n\r\n      showed such an irresistible desire to cross the threshold beyond which\r\n\r\n      some prodigious mystery had occurred; it appealed with so much eloquence,\r\n\r\n      not only of the mouth and eyes, but with all its features, that I could\r\n\r\n      not refrain from bursting into laughter. Frederic Larsan, no more than\r\n\r\n      myself, could retain his gravity. Meanwhile, standing on the other side of\r\n\r\n      the gate, he calmly put the key in his pocket. I closely scrutinised him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He might be about fifty years of age. He had a fine head, his hair turning\r\n\r\n      grey; a colourless complexion, and a firm profile. His forehead was\r\n\r\n      prominent, his chin and cheeks clean shaven. His upper lip, without\r\n\r\n      moustache, was finely chiselled. His eyes were rather small and round,\r\n\r\n      with a look in them that was at once searching and disquieting. He was of\r\n\r\n      middle height and well built, with a general bearing elegant and\r\n\r\n      gentlemanly. There was nothing about him of the vulgar policeman. In his\r\n\r\n      way, he was an artist, and one felt that he had a high opinion of himself.\r\n\r\n      The sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who had been\r\n\r\n      taught by experience. His strange profession had brought him into contact\r\n\r\n      with so many crimes and villanies that it would have been remarkable if\r\n\r\n      his nature had not been a little hardened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Larsan turned his head at the sound of a vehicle which had come from the\r\n\r\n      chateau and reached the gate behind him. We recognised the cab which had\r\n\r\n      conveyed the examining magistrate and his Registrar from the station at\r\n\r\n      Epinay.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d said Frederic Larsan, \u201cif you want to speak with Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac, he is here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The cab was already at the park gate and Robert Darzac was begging\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan to open it for him, explaining that he was pressed for\r\n\r\n      time to catch the next train leaving Epinay for Paris. Then he recognised\r\n\r\n      me. While Larsan was unlocking the gate, Monsieur Darzac inquired what had\r\n\r\n      brought me to the Glandier at such a tragic moment. I noticed that he was\r\n\r\n      frightfully pale, and that his face was lined as if from the effects of\r\n\r\n      some terrible suffering.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs Mademoiselle getting better?\u201d I immediately asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will be saved perhaps. She must be saved!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He did not add \u201cor it will be my death\u201d; but I felt that the phrase\r\n\r\n      trembled on his pale lips.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille intervened:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are in a hurry, Monsieur; but I must speak with you. I have something\r\n\r\n      of the greatest importance to tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan interrupted:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMay I leave you?\u201d he asked of Robert Darzac. \u201cHave you a key, or do you\r\n\r\n      wish me to give you this one.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThank you. I have a key and will lock the gate.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Larsan hurried off in the direction of the chateau, the imposing pile of\r\n\r\n      which could be perceived a few hundred yards away.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac, with knit brow, was beginning to show impatience. I\r\n\r\n      presented Rouletabille as a good friend of mine, but, as soon as he learnt\r\n\r\n      that the young man was a journalist, he looked at me very reproachfully,\r\n\r\n      excused himself, under the necessity of having to reach Epinay in twenty\r\n\r\n      minutes, bowed, and whipped up his horse. But Rouletabille had seized the\r\n\r\n      bridle and, to my utter astonishment, stopped the carriage with a vigorous\r\n\r\n      hand. Then he gave utterance to a sentence which was utterly meaningless\r\n\r\n      to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its\r\n\r\n      brightness.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The words had no sooner left the lips of Rouletabille than I saw Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac quail. Pale as he was, he became paler. His eyes were fixed on the\r\n\r\n      young man in terror, and he immediately descended from the vehicle in an\r\n\r\n      inexpressible state of agitation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome!\u2014come in!\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, suddenly, and with a sort of fury, he repeated:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet us go, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He turned up by the road he had come from the chateau, Rouletabille still\r\n\r\n      retaining his hold on the horse\u2019s bridle. I addressed a few words to\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac, but he made no answer. My looks questioned Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      but his gaze was elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER VI. In the Heart of the Oak Grove\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We reached the chateau, and, as we approached it, saw four gendarmes\r\n\r\n      pacing in front of a little door in the ground floor of the donjon. We\r\n\r\n      soon learned that in this ground floor, which had formerly served as a\r\n\r\n      prison, Monsieur and Madame Bernier, the concierges, were confined.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac led us into the modern part of the chateau by a\r\n\r\n      large door, protected by a projecting awning\u2014a \u201cmarquise\u201d as it is\r\n\r\n      called. Rouletabille, who had resigned the horse and the cab to the care\r\n\r\n      of a servant, never took his eyes off Monsieur Darzac. I followed his look\r\n\r\n      and perceived that it was directed solely towards the gloved hands of the\r\n\r\n      Sorbonne professor. When we were in a tiny sitting-room fitted with old\r\n\r\n      furniture, Monsieur Darzac turned to Rouletabille and said sharply:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter answered in an equally sharp tone:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo shake you by the hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Darzac shrank back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Evidently he understood, what I also understood, that my friend suspected\r\n\r\n      him of the abominable attempt on the life of Mademoiselle Stangerson. The\r\n\r\n      impression of the blood-stained hand on the walls of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n      in his mind. I looked at the man closely. His haughty face with its\r\n\r\n      expression ordinarily so straightforward was at this moment strangely\r\n\r\n      troubled. He held out his right hand and, referring to me, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs you are a friend of Monsieur Sainclair who has rendered me invaluable\r\n\r\n      services in a just cause, monsieur, I see no reason for refusing you my\r\n\r\n      hand\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille did not take the extended hand. Lying with the utmost\r\n\r\n      audacity, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I have lived several years in Russia, where I have acquired the\r\n\r\n      habit of never taking any but an ungloved hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I thought that the Sorbonne professor would express his anger openly, but,\r\n\r\n      on the contrary, by a visibly violent effort, he calmed himself, took off\r\n\r\n      his gloves, and showed his hands; they were unmarked by any cicatrix.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo!\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cMy dear friend,\u201d he said, turning to me, \u201cI\r\n\r\n      am obliged to ask you to leave us alone for a moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I bowed and retired; stupefied by what I had seen and heard. I could not\r\n\r\n      understand why Monsieur Robert Darzac had not already shown the door to my\r\n\r\n      impertinent, insulting, and stupid friend. I was angry myself with\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille at that moment, for his suspicions, which had led to this\r\n\r\n      scene of the gloves.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      For some twenty minutes I walked about in front of the chateau, trying\r\n\r\n      vainly to link together the different events of the day. What was in\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s mind? Was it possible that he thought Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac to be the murderer? How could it be thought that this man, who was\r\n\r\n      to have married Mademoiselle Stangerson in the course of a few days, had\r\n\r\n      introduced himself into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d to assassinate his fiancee? I\r\n\r\n      could find no explanation as to how the murderer had been able to leave\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d; and so long as that mystery, which appeared to me so\r\n\r\n      inexplicable, remained unexplained, I thought it was the duty of all of us\r\n\r\n      to refrain from suspecting anybody. But, then, that seemingly senseless\r\n\r\n      phrase\u2014\u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden\r\n\r\n      its brightness\u201d\u2014still rang in my ears. What did it mean? I was eager\r\n\r\n      to rejoin Rouletabille and question him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment the young man came out of the chateau in the company of\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac, and, extraordinary to relate, I saw, at a glance,\r\n\r\n      that they were the best of friends. \u201cWe are going to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. Come\r\n\r\n      with us,\u201d Rouletabille said to me. \u201cYou know, my dear boy, I am going to\r\n\r\n      keep you with me all day. We\u2019ll breakfast together somewhere about here\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll breakfast with me, here, gentlemen\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d replied the young man. \u201cWe shall breakfast at the Donjon\r\n\r\n      Inn.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll fare very badly there; you\u2019ll not find anything\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think so? Well, I hope to find something there,\u201d replied\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille. \u201cAfter breakfast, we\u2019ll set to work again. I\u2019ll write my\r\n\r\n      article and if you\u2019ll be so good as to take it to the office for me\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWon\u2019t you come back with me to Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo; I shall remain here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I turned towards Rouletabille. He spoke quite seriously, and Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac did not appear to be in the least degree surprised.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were passing by the donjon and heard wailing voices. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy have these people been arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a little my fault,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac. \u201cI happened to remark to\r\n\r\n      the examining magistrate yesterday that it was inexplicable that the\r\n\r\n      concierges had had time to hear the revolver shots, to dress themselves,\r\n\r\n      and to cover so great a distance as that which lies between their lodge\r\n\r\n      and the pavilion, in the space of two minutes; for not more than that\r\n\r\n      interval of time had elapsed after the firing of the shots when they were\r\n\r\n      met by Daddy Jacques.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat was suspicious evidently,\u201d acquiesced Rouletabille. \u201cAnd were they\r\n\r\n      dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is what is so incredible\u2014they were dressed\u2014completely\u2014not\r\n\r\n      one part of their costume wanting. The woman wore sabots, but the man had\r\n\r\n      on laced boots. Now they assert that they went to bed at half-past nine.\r\n\r\n      On arriving this morning, the examining magistrate brought with him from\r\n\r\n      Paris a revolver of the same calibre as that found in the room (for he\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t use the one held for evidence), and made his Registrar fire two\r\n\r\n      shots in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d while the doors and windows were closed. We were\r\n\r\n      with him in the lodge of the concierges, and yet we heard nothing, not a\r\n\r\n      sound. The concierges have lied, of that there can be no doubt. They must\r\n\r\n      have been already waiting, not far from the pavilion, waiting for\r\n\r\n      something! Certainly they are not to be accused of being the authors of\r\n\r\n      the crime, but their complicity is not improbable. That was why Monsieur\r\n\r\n      de Marquet had them arrested at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf they had been accomplices,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cthey would not have\r\n\r\n      been there at all. When people throw themselves into the arms of justice\r\n\r\n      with the proofs of complicity on them, you can be sure they are not\r\n\r\n      accomplices. I don\u2019t believe there are any accomplices in this affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, why were they abroad at midnight? Why don\u2019t they say?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have certainly some reason for their silence. What that reason is,\r\n\r\n      has to be found out; for, even if they are not accomplices, it may be of\r\n\r\n      importance. Everything that took place on such a night is important.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We had crossed an old bridge thrown over the Douve and were entering the\r\n\r\n      part of the park called the Oak Grove, The oaks here were centuries old.\r\n\r\n      Autumn had already shrivelled their tawny leaves, and their high branches,\r\n\r\n      black and contorted, looked like horrid heads of hair, mingled with quaint\r\n\r\n      reptiles such as the ancient sculptors have made on the head of Medusa.\r\n\r\n      This place, which Mademoiselle found cheerful and in which she lived in\r\n\r\n      the summer season, appeared to us as sad and funereal now. The soil was\r\n\r\n      black and muddy from the recent rains and the rotting of the fallen\r\n\r\n      leaves; the trunks of the trees were black and the sky above us was now,\r\n\r\n      as if in mourning, charged with great, heavy clouds.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And it was in this sombre and desolate retreat that we saw the white walls\r\n\r\n      of the pavilion as we approached. A queer-looking building without a\r\n\r\n      window visible on the side by which we neared it. A little door alone\r\n\r\n      marked the entrance to it. It might have passed for a tomb, a vast\r\n\r\n      mausoleum in the midst of a thick forest. As we came nearer, we were able\r\n\r\n      to make out its disposition. The building obtained all the light it needed\r\n\r\n      from the south, that is to say, from the open country. The little door\r\n\r\n      closed on the park. Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson must have found\r\n\r\n      it an ideal seclusion for their work and their dreams.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here is the ground plan of the pavilion. It had a ground-floor which was\r\n\r\n      reached by a few steps, and above it was an attic, with which we need not\r\n\r\n      concern ourselves. The plan of the ground-floor only, sketched roughly, is\r\n\r\n      what I here submit to the reader.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The plan was drawn by Rouletabille, and I assured myself that there was\r\n\r\n      not a line in it that was wanting to help to the solution of the problem\r\n\r\n      then set before the police. With the lines of this plan and the\r\n\r\n      description of its parts before them, my readers will know as much as\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille knew when he entered the pavilion for the first time. With\r\n\r\n      him they may now ask: How did the murderer escape from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\r\n\r\n      Before mounting the three steps leading up to the door of the pavilion,\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille stopped and asked Monsieur Darzac point blank:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat was the motive for the crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeaking for myself, Monsieur, there can be no doubt on the matter,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance, greatly distressed. \u201cThe nails of the\r\n\r\n      fingers, the deep scratches on the chest and throat of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson show that the wretch who attacked her attempted to commit a\r\n\r\n      frightful crime. The medical experts who examined these traces yesterday\r\n\r\n      affirm that they were made by the same hand as that which left its red\r\n\r\n      imprint on the wall; an enormous hand, Monsieur, much too large to go into\r\n\r\n      my gloves,\u201d he added with an indefinable smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCould not that blood-stained hand,\u201d I interrupted, \u201chave been the hand of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson who, in the moment of falling, had pressed it\r\n\r\n      against the wall, and, in slipping, enlarged the impression?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was not a drop of blood on either of her hands when she was lifted\r\n\r\n      up,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are now sure,\u201d said I, \u201cthat it was Mademoiselle Stangerson who was\r\n\r\n      armed with Daddy Jacques\u2019s revolver, since she wounded the hand of the\r\n\r\n      murderer. She was in fear, then, of somebody or something.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cProbably.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you suspect anybody?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac, looking at Rouletabille. Rouletabille then\r\n\r\n      said to me:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou must know, my friend, that the inquiry is a little more advanced than\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet has chosen to tell us. He not only knows that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson defended herself with the revolver, but he knows\r\n\r\n      what the weapon was that was used to attack her. Monsieur Darzac tells me\r\n\r\n      it was a mutton-bone. Why is Monsieur de Marquet surrounding this\r\n\r\n      mutton-bone with so much mystery? No doubt for the purpose of facilitating\r\n\r\n      the inquiries of the agents of the Surete? He imagines, perhaps, that the\r\n\r\n      owner of this instrument of crime, the most terrible invented, is going to\r\n\r\n      be found amongst those who are well-known in the slums of Paris who use\r\n\r\n      it. But who can ever say what passes through the brain of an examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate?\u201d Rouletabille added with contemptuous irony.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHas a mutton-bone been found in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\u201d I asked him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u201d said Robert Darzac, \u201cat the foot of the bed; but I beg of\r\n\r\n      you not to say anything about it.\u201d (I made a gesture of assent.) \u201cIt was\r\n\r\n      an enormous mutton-bone, the top of which, or rather the joint, was still\r\n\r\n      red with the blood of the frightful wound. It was an old bone, which may,\r\n\r\n      according to appearances, have served in other crimes. That\u2019s what\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet thinks. He has had it sent to the municipal laboratory\r\n\r\n      at Paris to be analysed. In fact, he thinks he has detected on it, not\r\n\r\n      only the blood of the last victim, but other stains of dried blood,\r\n\r\n      evidences of previous crimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA mutton-bone in the hand of a skilled assassin is a frightful weapon,\u201d\r\n\r\n       said Rouletabille, \u201ca more certain weapon than a heavy hammer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe scoundrel has proved it to be so,\u201d said Monsieur Robert Darzac,\r\n\r\n      sadly. \u201cThe joint of the bone found exactly fits the wound inflicted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy belief is that the wound would have been mortal, if the murderer\u2019s\r\n\r\n      blow had not been arrested in the act by Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s\r\n\r\n      revolver. Wounded in the hand, he dropped the mutton-bone and fled.\r\n\r\n      Unfortunately, the blow had been already given, and Mademoiselle was\r\n\r\n      stunned after having been nearly strangled. If she had succeeded in\r\n\r\n      wounding the man with the first shot of the revolver, she would,\r\n\r\n      doubtless, have escaped the blow with the bone. But she had certainly\r\n\r\n      employeed her revolver too late; the first shot deviated and lodged in the\r\n\r\n      ceiling; it was the second only that took effect.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having said this, Monsieur Darzac knocked at the door of the pavilion. I\r\n\r\n      must confess to feeling a strong impatience to reach the spot where the\r\n\r\n      crime had been committed. It was some time before the door was opened by a\r\n\r\n      man whom I at once recognised as Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He appeared to be well over sixty years of age. He had a long white beard\r\n\r\n      and white hair, on which he wore a flat Basque cap. He was dressed in a\r\n\r\n      complete suit of chestnut-coloured velveteen, worn at the sides; sabots\r\n\r\n      were on his feet. He had rather a waspish-looking face, the expression of\r\n\r\n      which lightened, however, as soon as he saw Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFriends,\u201d said our guide. \u201cNobody in the pavilion, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI ought not to allow anybody to enter, Monsieur Robert, but of course the\r\n\r\n      order does not apply to you. These gentlemen of justice have seen\r\n\r\n      everything there is to be seen, and made enough drawings, and drawn up\r\n\r\n      enough reports\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur Jacques, one question before anything else,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it, young man? If I can answer it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid your mistress wear her hair in bands, that evening? You know what I\r\n\r\n      mean\u2014over her forehead?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, young man. My mistress never wore her hair in the way you suggest,\r\n\r\n      neither on that day nor on any other. She had her hair drawn up, as usual,\r\n\r\n      so that her beautiful forehead could be seen, pure as that of an unborn\r\n\r\n      child!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille grunted and set to work examining the door, finding that it\r\n\r\n      fastened itself automatically. He satisfied himself that it could never\r\n\r\n      remain open and needed a key to open it. Then we entered the vestibule, a\r\n\r\n      small, well-lit room paved with square red tiles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! This is the window by which the murderer escaped!\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo they keep on saying, monsieur, so they keep on saying! But if he had\r\n\r\n      gone off that way, we should have been sure to have seen him. We are not\r\n\r\n      blind, neither Monsieur Stangerson nor me, nor the concierges who are in\r\n\r\n      prison. Why have they not put me in prison, too, on account of my\r\n\r\n      revolver?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had already opened the window and was examining the shutters.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWere these closed at the time of the crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd fastened with the iron catch inside,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, \u201cand I am\r\n\r\n      quite sure that the murderer did not get out that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre there any blood stains?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, on the stones outside; but blood of what?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cthere are footmarks visible on the path\u2014the\r\n\r\n      ground was very moist. I will look into that presently.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNonsense!\u201d interrupted Daddy Jacques; \u201cthe murderer did not go that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhich way did he go, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do I know?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at everything, smelled everything. He went down on his\r\n\r\n      knees and rapidly examined every one of the paving tiles. Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u2014you can\u2019t find anything, monsieur. Nothing has been found. And\r\n\r\n      now it is all dirty; too many persons have tramped over it. They wouldn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      let me wash it, but on the day of the crime I had washed the floor\r\n\r\n      thoroughly, and if the murderer had crossed it with his hobnailed boots, I\r\n\r\n      should not have failed to see where he had been; he has left marks enough\r\n\r\n      in Mademoiselle\u2019s chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille rose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen was the last time you washed these tiles?\u201d he asked, and he fixed on\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques a most searching look.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy\u2014as I told you\u2014on the day of the crime, towards half-past\r\n\r\n      five\u2014while Mademoiselle and her father were taking a little walk\r\n\r\n      before dinner, here in this room: they had dined in the laboratory. The\r\n\r\n      next day, the examining magistrate came and saw all the marks there were\r\n\r\n      on the floor as plainly as if they had been made with ink on white paper.\r\n\r\n      Well, neither in the laboratory nor in the vestibule, which were both as\r\n\r\n      clean as a new pin, were there any traces of a man\u2019s footmarks. Since they\r\n\r\n      have been found near this window outside, he must have made his way\r\n\r\n      through the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d into the attic, then cut his way\r\n\r\n      through the roof and dropped to the ground outside the vestibule window.\r\n\r\n      But\u2014there\u2019s no hole, neither in the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d nor\r\n\r\n      in the roof of my attic\u2014that\u2019s absolutely certain! So you see we\r\n\r\n      know nothing\u2014nothing! And nothing will ever be known! It\u2019s a mystery\r\n\r\n      of the Devil\u2019s own making.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille went down upon his knees again almost in front of a small\r\n\r\n      lavatory at the back of the vestibule. In that position he remained for\r\n\r\n      about a minute.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d I asked him when he got up.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! nothing very important,\u2014a drop of blood,\u201d he replied, turning\r\n\r\n      towards Daddy Jacques as he spoke. \u201cWhile you were washing the laboratory\r\n\r\n      and this vestibule, was the vestibule window open?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur, it was closed; but after I had done washing the floor, I\r\n\r\n      lit some charcoal for Monsieur in the laboratory furnace, and, as I lit it\r\n\r\n      with old newspapers, it smoked, so I opened both the windows in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory and this one, to make a current of air; then I shut those in\r\n\r\n      the laboratory and left this one open when I went out. When I returned to\r\n\r\n      the pavilion, this window had been closed and Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      were already at work in the laboratory.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson had, no doubt, shut it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou did not ask them?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      After a close scrutiny of the little lavatory and of the staircase leading\r\n\r\n      up to the attic, Rouletabille\u2014to whom we seemed no longer to exist\u2014entered\r\n\r\n      the laboratory. I followed him. It was, I confess, in a state of great\r\n\r\n      excitement. Robert Darzac lost none of my friend\u2019s movements. As for me,\r\n\r\n      my eyes were drawn at once to the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. It was closed\r\n\r\n      and, as I immediately saw, partially shattered and out of commission.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend, who went about his work methodically, silently studied the room\r\n\r\n      in which we were. It was large and well-lighted. Two big windows\u2014almost\r\n\r\n      bays\u2014were protected by strong iron bars and looked out upon a wide\r\n\r\n      extent of country. Through an opening in the forest, they commanded a\r\n\r\n      wonderful view through the length of the valley and across the plain to\r\n\r\n      the large town which could be clearly seen in fair weather. To-day,\r\n\r\n      however, a mist hung over the ground\u2014and blood in that room!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The whole of one side of the laboratory was taken up with a large chimney,\r\n\r\n      crucibles, ovens, and such implements as are needed for chemical\r\n\r\n      experiments; tables, loaded with phials, papers, reports, an electrical\r\n\r\n      machine,\u2014an apparatus, as Monsieur Darzac informed me, employeed by\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson to demonstrate the Dissociation of Matter under the\r\n\r\n      action of solar light\u2014and other scientific implements.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Along the walls were cabinets, plain or glass-fronted, through which were\r\n\r\n      visible microscopes, special photographic apparatus, and a large quantity\r\n\r\n      of crystals.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, who was ferreting in the chimney, put his fingers into one\r\n\r\n      of the crucibles. Suddenly he drew himself up, and held up a piece of\r\n\r\n      half-consumed paper in his hand. He stepped up to where we were talking by\r\n\r\n      one of the windows.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cKeep that for us, Monsieur Darzac,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I bent over the piece of scorched paper which Monsieur Darzac took from\r\n\r\n      the hand of Rouletabille, and read distinctly the only words that remained\r\n\r\n      legible:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPresbytery\u2014lost nothing\u2014charm, nor the gar\u2014its\r\n\r\n      brightness.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Twice since the morning these same meaningless words had struck me, and,\r\n\r\n      for the second time, I saw that they produced on the Sorbonne professor\r\n\r\n      the same paralysing effect. Monsieur Darzac\u2019s first anxiety showed itself\r\n\r\n      when he turned his eyes in the direction of Daddy Jacques. But, occupied\r\n\r\n      as he was at another window, he had seen nothing. Then tremblingly opening\r\n\r\n      his pocket-book he put the piece of paper into it, sighing: \u201cMy God!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      During this time, Rouletabille had mounted into the opening of the\r\n\r\n      fire-grate\u2014that is to say, he had got upon the bricks of a furnace\u2014and\r\n\r\n      was attentively examining the chimney, which grew narrower towards the\r\n\r\n      top, the outlet from it being closed with sheets of iron, fastened into\r\n\r\n      the brickwork, through which passed three small chimneys.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cImpossible to get out that way,\u201d he said, jumping back into the\r\n\r\n      laboratory. \u201cBesides, even if he had tried to do it, he would have brought\r\n\r\n      all that ironwork down to the ground. No, no; it is not on that side we\r\n\r\n      have to search.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille next examined the furniture and opened the doors of the\r\n\r\n      cabinet. Then he came to the windows, through which he declared no one\r\n\r\n      could possibly have passed. At the second window he found Daddy Jacques in\r\n\r\n      contemplation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, Daddy Jacques,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat are you looking at?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat policeman who is always going round and round the lake. Another of\r\n\r\n      those fellows who think they can see better than anybody else!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t know Frederic Larsan, Daddy Jacques, or you wouldn\u2019t speak of\r\n\r\n      him in that way,\u201d said Rouletabille in a melancholy tone. \u201cIf there is\r\n\r\n      anyone who will find the murderer, it will be he.\u201d And Rouletabille heaved\r\n\r\n      a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBefore they find him, they will have to learn how they lost him,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques, stolidly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At length we reached the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d itself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is the door behind which some terrible scene took place,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, with a solemnity which, under any other circumstances, would\r\n\r\n      have been comical.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER VII. In Which Rouletabille Sets Out on an Expedition Under the Bed\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille having pushed open the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d paused on the\r\n\r\n      threshold saying, with an emotion which I only later understood, \u201cAh, the\r\n\r\n      perfume of the lady in black!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The chamber was dark. Daddy Jacques was about to open the blinds when\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille stopped him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid not the tragedy take place in complete darkness?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, young man, I don\u2019t think so. Mademoiselle always had a nightlight on\r\n\r\n      her table, and I lit it every evening before she went to bed. I was a sort\r\n\r\n      of chambermaid, you must understand, when the evening came. The real\r\n\r\n      chambermaid did not come here much before the morning. Mademoiselle worked\r\n\r\n      late\u2014far into the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere did the table with the night-light stand,\u2014far from the bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSome way from the bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan you light the burner now?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled when the table\r\n\r\n      was upset. All the rest of the things in the room remain just as they\r\n\r\n      were. I have only to open the blinds for you to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWait.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the shutters of the two\r\n\r\n      windows and the door of the vestibule.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place where\r\n\r\n      the night-light was burning that night.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques who was in his stockings\u2014he usually left his sabots in\r\n\r\n      the vestibule\u2014entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d with his bit of a vesta. We\r\n\r\n      vaguely distinguished objects overthrown on the floor, a bed in one\r\n\r\n      corner, and, in front of us, to the left, the gleam of a looking-glass\r\n\r\n      hanging on the wall, near to the bed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat will do!\u2014you may now open the blinds,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t come any further,\u201d Daddy Jacques begged, \u201cyou may make marks with\r\n\r\n      your boots, and nothing must be deranged; it\u2019s an idea of the magistrate\u2019s\u2014though\r\n\r\n      he has nothing more to do here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he pushed open the shutter. The pale daylight entered from without,\r\n\r\n      throwing a sinister light on the saffron-coloured walls. The floor\u2014for\r\n\r\n      though the laboratory and the vestibule were tiled, \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d had a\r\n\r\n      flooring of wood\u2014was covered with a single yellow mat which was\r\n\r\n      large enough to cover nearly the whole room, under the bed and under the\r\n\r\n      dressing-table\u2014the only piece of furniture that remained upright.\r\n\r\n      The centre round table, the night-table and two chairs had been\r\n\r\n      overturned. These did not prevent a large stain of blood being visible on\r\n\r\n      the mat, made, as Daddy Jacques informed us, by the blood which had flowed\r\n\r\n      from the wound on Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s forehead. Besides these\r\n\r\n      stains, drops of blood had fallen in all directions, in line with the\r\n\r\n      visible traces of the footsteps\u2014large and black\u2014of the\r\n\r\n      murderer. Everything led to the presumption that these drops of blood had\r\n\r\n      fallen from the wound of the man who had, for a moment, placed his red\r\n\r\n      hand on the wall. There were other traces of the same hand on the wall,\r\n\r\n      but much less distinct.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSee!\u2014see this blood on the wall!\u201d I could not help exclaiming. \u201cThe\r\n\r\n      man who pressed his hand so heavily upon it in the darkness must certainly\r\n\r\n      have thought that he was pushing at a door! That\u2019s why he pressed on it so\r\n\r\n      hard, leaving on the yellow paper the terrible evidence. I don\u2019t think\r\n\r\n      there are many hands in the world of that sort. It is big and strong and\r\n\r\n      the fingers are nearly all one as long as the other! The thumb is wanting\r\n\r\n      and we have only the mark of the palm; but if we follow the trace of the\r\n\r\n      hand,\u201d I continued, \u201cwe see that, after leaving its imprint on the wall,\r\n\r\n      the touch sought the door, found it, and then felt for the lock\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt,\u201d interrupted Rouletabille, chuckling,\u2014\u201conly there is no\r\n\r\n      blood, either on the lock or on the bolt!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does that prove?\u201d I rejoined with a good sense of which I was proud;\r\n\r\n      \u201che might have opened the lock with his left hand, which would have been\r\n\r\n      quite natural, his right hand being wounded.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe didn\u2019t open it at all!\u201d Daddy Jacques again exclaimed. \u201cWe are not\r\n\r\n      fools; and there were four of us when we burst open the door!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a queer hand!\u2014Look what a queer hand it is!\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a very natural hand,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cof which the shape has\r\n\r\n      been deformed by its having slipped on the wall. The man dried his hand on\r\n\r\n      the wall. He must be a man about five feet eight in height.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you come at that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the height of the marks on the wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend next occupied himself with the mark of the bullet in the wall.\r\n\r\n      It was a round hole.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis ball was fired straight, not from above, and consequently, not from\r\n\r\n      below.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the lock and the\r\n\r\n      bolt, satisfying himself that the door had certainly been burst open from\r\n\r\n      the outside, and, further, that the key had been found in the lock on the\r\n\r\n      inside of the chamber. He finally satisfied himself that with the key in\r\n\r\n      the lock, the door could not possibly be opened from without with another\r\n\r\n      key. Having made sure of all these details, he let fall these words:\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d\u2014Then sitting down on the ground, he hastily took\r\n\r\n      off his boots and, in his socks, went into the room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The first thing he did was to examine minutely the overturned furniture.\r\n\r\n      We watched him in silence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYoung fellow, you are giving yourself a great deal of trouble,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques ironically.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille raised his head and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have spoken the simple truth, Daddy Jacques; your mistress did not\r\n\r\n      have her hair in bands that evening. I was a donkey to have believed she\r\n\r\n      did.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, with the suppleness of a serpent, he slipped under the bed.\r\n\r\n      Presently we heard him ask:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt what time, Monsieur Jacques, did Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      arrive at the laboratory?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt six o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The voice of Rouletabille continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u2014he\u2019s been under here,\u2014that\u2019s certain; in fact, there was\r\n\r\n      no where else where he could have hidden himself. Here, too, are the marks\r\n\r\n      of his hobnails. When you entered\u2014all four of you\u2014did you look\r\n\r\n      under the bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt once,\u2014we drew it right out of its place\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd between the mattresses?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was only one on the bed, and on that Mademoiselle was placed; and\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge immediately carried it into the\r\n\r\n      laboratory. Under the mattress there was nothing but the metal netting,\r\n\r\n      which could not conceal anything or anybody. Remember, monsieur, that\r\n\r\n      there were four of us and we couldn\u2019t fail to see everything\u2014the\r\n\r\n      chamber is so small and scantily furnished, and all was locked behind in\r\n\r\n      the pavilion.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I ventured on a hypothesis:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps he got away with the mattress\u2014in the mattress!\u2014Anything\r\n\r\n      is possible, in the face of such a mystery! In their distress of mind\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge may not have noticed they were\r\n\r\n      bearing a double weight; especially if the concierge were an accomplice! I\r\n\r\n      throw out this hypothesis for what it is worth, but it explains many\r\n\r\n      things,\u2014and particularly the fact that neither the laboratory nor\r\n\r\n      the vestibule bear any traces of the footmarks found in the room. If, in\r\n\r\n      carrying Mademoiselle on the mattress from the laboratory of the chateau,\r\n\r\n      they rested for a moment, there might have been an opportunity for the man\r\n\r\n      in it to escape.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then?\u201d asked Rouletabille, deliberately laughing under the bed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I felt rather vexed and replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u2014but anything appears possible\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe examining magistrate had the same idea, monsieur,\u201d said Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques, \u201cand he carefully examined the mattress. He was obliged to laugh\r\n\r\n      at the idea, monsieur, as your friend is doing now,\u2014for whoever\r\n\r\n      heard of a mattress having a double bottom?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was myself obliged to laugh, on seeing that what I had said was absurd;\r\n\r\n      but in an affair like this one hardly knows where an absurdity begins or\r\n\r\n      ends.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend alone seemed able to talk intelligently. He called out from\r\n\r\n      under the bed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe mat here has been moved out of place,\u2014who did it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe did, monsieur,\u201d explained Daddy Jacques. \u201cWhen we could not find the\r\n\r\n      assassin, we asked ourselves whether there was not some hole in the floor\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is not,\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cIs there a cellar?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, there\u2019s no cellar. But that has not stopped our searching, and has\r\n\r\n      not prevented the examining magistrate and his Registrar from studying the\r\n\r\n      floor plank by plank, as if there had been a cellar under it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter then reappeared. His eyes were sparkling and his nostrils\r\n\r\n      quivered. He remained on his hands and knees. He could not be better\r\n\r\n      likened than to an admirable sporting dog on the scent of some unusual\r\n\r\n      game. And, indeed, he was scenting the steps of a man,\u2014the man whom\r\n\r\n      he has sworn to report to his master, the manager of the \u201cEpoque.\u201d It must\r\n\r\n      not be forgotten that Rouletabille was first and last a journalist.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thus, on his hands and knees, he made his way to the four corners of the\r\n\r\n      room, so to speak, sniffing and going round everything\u2014everything\r\n\r\n      that we could see, which was not much, and everything that we could not\r\n\r\n      see, which must have been infinite.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The toilette table was a simple table standing on four legs; there was\r\n\r\n      nothing about it by which it could possibly be changed into a temporary\r\n\r\n      hiding-place. There was not a closet or cupboard. Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      kept her wardrobe at the chateau.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille literally passed his nose and hands along the walls,\r\n\r\n      constructed of solid brickwork. When he had finished with the walls, and\r\n\r\n      passed his agile fingers over every portion of the yellow paper covering\r\n\r\n      them, he reached to the ceiling, which he was able to touch by mounting on\r\n\r\n      a chair placed on the toilette table, and by moving this ingeniously\r\n\r\n      constructed stage from place to place he examined every foot of it. When\r\n\r\n      he had finished his scrutiny of the ceiling, where he carefully examined\r\n\r\n      the hole made by the second bullet, he approached the window, and, once\r\n\r\n      more, examined the iron bars and blinds, all of which were solid and\r\n\r\n      intact. At last, he gave a grunt of satisfaction and declared \u201cNow I am at\r\n\r\n      ease!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u2014do you believe that the poor dear young lady was shut up when\r\n\r\n      she was being murdered\u2014when she cried out for help?\u201d wailed Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said the young reporter, drying his forehead, \u201c\u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n      as tightly shut as an iron safe.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cis why this mystery is the most surprising I know. Edgar\r\n\r\n      Allan Poe, in \u2018The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\u2019 invented nothing like it.\r\n\r\n      The place of that crime was sufficiently closed to prevent the escape of a\r\n\r\n      man; but there was that window through which the monkey, the perpetrator\r\n\r\n      of the murder, could slip away! But here, there can be no question of an\r\n\r\n      opening of any sort. The door was fastened, and through the window blinds,\r\n\r\n      secure as they were, not even a fly could enter or get out.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTrue, true,\u201d assented Rouletabille as he kept on drying his forehead,\r\n\r\n      which seemed to be perspiring less from his recent bodily exertion than\r\n\r\n      from his mental agitation. \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s a great, a beautiful, and a very\r\n\r\n      curious mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Bete du bon Dieu,\u201d muttered Daddy Jacques, \u201cthe Bete du bon Dieu\r\n\r\n      herself, if she had committed the crime, could not have escaped. Listen!\r\n\r\n      Do you hear it? Hush!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques made us a sign to keep quiet and, stretching his arm towards\r\n\r\n      the wall nearest the forest, listened to something which we could not\r\n\r\n      hear.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s answering,\u201d he said at length. \u201cI must kill it. It is too wicked,\r\n\r\n      but it\u2019s the Bete du bon Dieu, and, every night, it goes to pray on the\r\n\r\n      tomb of Sainte-Genevieve and nobody dares to touch her, for fear that\r\n\r\n      Mother Angenoux should cast an evil spell on them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow big is the Bete du bon Dieu?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNearly as big as a small retriever,\u2014a monster, I tell you. Ah!\u2014I\r\n\r\n      have asked myself more than once whether it was not her that took our poor\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle by the throat with her claws. But the Bete du bon Dieu does\r\n\r\n      not wear hobnailed boots, nor fire revolvers, nor has she a hand like\r\n\r\n      that!\u201d exclaimed Daddy Jacques, again pointing out to us the red mark on\r\n\r\n      the wall. \u201cBesides, we should have seen her as well as we would have seen\r\n\r\n      a man\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently,\u201d I said. \u201cBefore we had seen this Yellow Room, I had also\r\n\r\n      asked myself whether the cat of Mother Angenoux\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou also!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot for a moment. After reading the article in the \u2018Matin,\u2019 I knew that a\r\n\r\n      cat had nothing to do with the matter. But I swear now that a frightful\r\n\r\n      tragedy has been enacted here. You say nothing about the Basque cap, or\r\n\r\n      the handkerchief, found here, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf course, the magistrate has taken them,\u201d the old man answered,\r\n\r\n      hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI haven\u2019t seen either the handkerchief or the cap, yet I can tell you how\r\n\r\n      they are made,\u201d the reporter said to him gravely.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, you are very clever,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, coughing and embarrassed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe handkerchief is a large one, blue with red stripes and the cap is an\r\n\r\n      old Basque cap, like the one you are wearing now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are a wizard!\u201d said Daddy Jacques, trying to laugh and not quite\r\n\r\n      succeeding. \u201cHow do you know that the handkerchief is blue with red\r\n\r\n      stripes?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause, if it had not been blue with red stripes, it would not have been\r\n\r\n      found at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Without giving any further attention to Daddy Jacques, my friend took a\r\n\r\n      piece of paper from his pocket, and taking out a pair of scissors, bent\r\n\r\n      over the footprints. Placing the paper over one of them he began to cut.\r\n\r\n      In a short time he had made a perfect pattern which he handed to me,\r\n\r\n      begging me not to lose it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He then returned to the window and, pointing to the figure of Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan, who had not quitted the side of the lake, asked Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      whether the detective had, like himself, been working in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied Robert Darzac, who, since Rouletabille had handed him the\r\n\r\n      piece of scorched paper, had not uttered a word, \u201cHe pretends that he does\r\n\r\n      not need to examine \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. He says that the murderer made his\r\n\r\n      escape from it in quite a natural way, and that he will, this evening,\r\n\r\n      explain how he did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As he listened to what Monsieur Darzac had to say, Rouletabille turned\r\n\r\n      pale.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHas Frederic Larsan found out the truth, which I can only guess at?\u201d he\r\n\r\n      murmured. \u201cHe is very clever\u2014very clever\u2014and I admire him. But\r\n\r\n      what we have to do to-day is something more than the work of a policeman,\r\n\r\n      something quite different from the teachings of experience. We have to\r\n\r\n      take hold of our reason by the right end.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter rushed into the open air, agitated by the thought that the\r\n\r\n      great and famous Fred might anticipate him in the solution of the problem\r\n\r\n      of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I managed to reach him on the threshold of the pavilion. \u201cCalm yourself,\r\n\r\n      my dear fellow,\u201d I said. \u201cAren\u2019t you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he confessed to me, with a deep sigh. \u201cI am quite satisfied. I have\r\n\r\n      discovered many things.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMoral or material?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSeveral moral,\u2014one material. This, for example.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And rapidly he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper in which he\r\n\r\n      had placed a light-coloured hair from a woman\u2019s head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER VIII. The Examining Magistrate Questions Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Two minutes later, as Rouletabille was bending over the footprints\r\n\r\n      discovered in the park, under the window of the vestibule, a man,\r\n\r\n      evidently a servant at the chateau, came towards us rapidly and called out\r\n\r\n      to Monsieur Darzac then coming out of the pavilion:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Robert, the magistrate, you know, is questioning Mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac uttered a muttered excuse to us and set off running\r\n\r\n      towards the chateau, the man running after him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf the corpse can speak,\u201d I said, \u201cit would be interesting to be there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must know,\u201d said my friend. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the chateau.\u201d And he drew me\r\n\r\n      with him. But, at the chateau, a gendarme placed in the vestibule denied\r\n\r\n      us admission up the staircase of the first floor. We were obliged to wait\r\n\r\n      down stairs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This is what passed in the chamber of the victim while we were waiting\r\n\r\n      below.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The family doctor, finding that Mademoiselle Stangerson was much better,\r\n\r\n      but fearing a relapse which would no longer permit of her being\r\n\r\n      questioned, had thought it his duty to inform the examining magistrate of\r\n\r\n      this, who decided to proceed immediately with a brief examination. At this\r\n\r\n      examination, the Registrar, Monsieur Stangerson, and the doctor were\r\n\r\n      present. Later, I obtained the text of the report of the examination, and\r\n\r\n      I give it here, in all its legal dryness:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuestion. Are you able, mademoiselle, without too much fatiguing\r\n\r\n      yourself, to give some necessary details of the frightful attack of which\r\n\r\n      you have been the victim?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnswer. I feel much better, monsieur, and I will tell you all I know.\r\n\r\n      When I entered my chamber I did not notice anything unusual there.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Excuse me, mademoiselle,\u2014if you will allow me, I will ask you\r\n\r\n      some questions and you will answer them. That will fatigue you less than\r\n\r\n      making a long recital.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. Do so, monsieur.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. What did you do on that day?\u2014I want you to be as minute and\r\n\r\n      precise as possible. I wish to know all you did that day, if it is not\r\n\r\n      asking too much of you.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. I rose late, at ten o\u2019clock, for my father and I had returned home\r\n\r\n      late on the night previously, having been to dinner at the reception given\r\n\r\n      by the President of the Republic, in honour of the Academy of Science of\r\n\r\n      Philadelphia. When I left my chamber, at half-past ten, my father was\r\n\r\n      already at work in the laboratory. We worked together till midday. We then\r\n\r\n      took half-an-hour\u2019s walk in the park, as we were accustomed to do, before\r\n\r\n      breakfasting at the chateau. After breakfast, we took another walk for\r\n\r\n      half an hour, and then returned to the laboratory. There we found my\r\n\r\n      chambermaid, who had come to set my room in order. I went into The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room to give her some slight orders and she directly afterwards left the\r\n\r\n      pavilion, and I resumed my work with my father. At five o\u2019clock, we again\r\n\r\n      went for a walk in the park and afterward had tea.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Before leaving the pavilion at five o\u2019clock, did you go into your\r\n\r\n      chamber?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. No, monsieur, my father went into it, at my request to bring me my\r\n\r\n      hat.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. And he found nothing suspicious there?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. Evidently no, monsieur.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. It is, then, almost certain that the murderer was not yet concealed\r\n\r\n      under the bed. When you went out, was the door of the room locked?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. No, there was no reason for locking it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. You were absent from the pavilion some length of time, Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and you?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. About an hour.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. It was during that hour, no doubt, that the murderer got into the\r\n\r\n      pavilion. But how? Nobody knows. Footmarks have been found in the park,\r\n\r\n      leading away from the window of the vestibule, but none has been found\r\n\r\n      going towards it. Did you notice whether the vestibule window was open\r\n\r\n      when you went out?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. I don\u2019t remember.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Stangerson. It was closed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. And when you returned?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson. I did not notice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. Stangerson. It was still closed. I remember remarking aloud: \u2018Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques must surely have opened it while we were away.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Strange!\u2014Do you recollect, Monsieur Stangerson, if during your\r\n\r\n      absence, and before going out, he had opened it? You returned to the\r\n\r\n      laboratory at six o\u2019clock and resumed work?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson. Yes, monsieur.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. And you did not leave the laboratory from that hour up to the moment\r\n\r\n      when you entered your chamber?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. Stangerson. Neither my daughter nor I, monsieur. We were engaged on\r\n\r\n      work that was pressing, and we lost not a moment,\u2014neglecting\r\n\r\n      everything else on that account.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Did you dine in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. For that reason.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Are you accustomed to dine in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. We rarely dine there.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Could the murderer have known that you would dine there that evening?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. Stangerson. Good Heavens!\u2014I think not. It was only when we\r\n\r\n      returned to the pavilion at six o\u2019clock, that we decided, my daughter and\r\n\r\n      I, to dine there. At that moment I was spoken to by my gamekeeper, who\r\n\r\n      detained me a moment, to ask me to accompany him on an urgent tour of\r\n\r\n      inspection in a part of the woods which I had decided to thin. I put this\r\n\r\n      off until the next day, and begged him, as he was going by the chateau, to\r\n\r\n      tell the steward that we should dine in the laboratory. He left me, to\r\n\r\n      execute the errand and I rejoined my daughter, who was already at work.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. At what hour, mademoiselle, did you go to your chamber while your\r\n\r\n      father continued to work there?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. At midnight.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Did Daddy Jacques enter \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d in the course of the evening?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. To shut the blinds and light the night-light.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. He saw nothing suspicious?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. He would have told us if he had seen. Daddy Jacques is an honest man\r\n\r\n      and very attached to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. You affirm, Monsieur Stangerson, that Daddy Jacques remained with you\r\n\r\n      all the time you were in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. Stangerson. I am sure of it. I have no doubt of that.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. When you entered your chamber, mademoiselle, you immediately shut the\r\n\r\n      door and locked and bolted it? That was taking unusual precautions,\r\n\r\n      knowing that your father and your servant were there? Were you in fear of\r\n\r\n      something, then?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. My father would be returning to the chateau and Daddy Jacques would be\r\n\r\n      going to his bed. And, in fact, I did fear something.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. You were so much in fear of something that you borrowed Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques\u2019s revolver without telling him you had done so?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. That is true. I did not wish to alarm anybody,\u2014the more, because\r\n\r\n      my fears might have proved to have been foolish.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. What was it you feared?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. I hardly know how to tell you. For several nights, I seemed to hear,\r\n\r\n      both in the park and out of the park, round the pavilion, unusual sounds,\r\n\r\n      sometimes footsteps, at other times the cracking of branches. The night\r\n\r\n      before the attack on me, when I did not get to bed before three o\u2019clock in\r\n\r\n      the morning, on our return from the Elysee, I stood for a moment before my\r\n\r\n      window, and I felt sure I saw shadows.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. How many?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. Two. They moved round the lake,\u2014then the moon became clouded and\r\n\r\n      I lost sight of them. At this time of the season, every year, I have\r\n\r\n      generally returned to my apartment in the chateau for the winter; but this\r\n\r\n      year I said to myself that I would not quit the pavilion before my father\r\n\r\n      had finished the resume of his works on the \u2018Dissociation of Matter\u2019 for\r\n\r\n      the Academy. I did not wish that that important work, which was to have\r\n\r\n      been finished in the course of a few days, should be delayed by a change\r\n\r\n      in our daily habit. You can well understand that I did not wish to speak\r\n\r\n      of my childish fears to my father, nor did I say anything to Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      who, I knew, would not have been able to hold his tongue. Knowing that he\r\n\r\n      had a revolver in his room, I took advantage of his absence and borrowed\r\n\r\n      it, placing it in the drawer of my night-table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the interrogation of Mademoiselle Stangerson concluded.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille waited patiently for Monsieur Robert Darzac, who soon\r\n\r\n      appeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      From a room near the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had heard the\r\n\r\n      interrogatory and now came to recount it to my friend with great\r\n\r\n      exactitude, aided by an excellent memory. His docility still surprised me.\r\n\r\n      Thanks to hasty pencil-notes, he was able to reproduce, almost textually,\r\n\r\n      the questions and the answers given.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It looked as if Monsieur Darzac were being employeed as the secretary of my\r\n\r\n      young friend and acted as if he could refuse him nothing; nay, more, as if\r\n\r\n      under a compulsion to do so.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The fact of the closed window struck the reporter as it had struck the\r\n\r\n      magistrate. Rouletabille asked Darzac to repeat once more Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s account of how she and her father had spent their time on the\r\n\r\n      day of the tragedy, as she had stated it to the magistrate. The\r\n\r\n      circumstance of the dinner in the laboratory seemed to interest him in the\r\n\r\n      highest degree; and he had it repeated to him three times. He also wanted\r\n\r\n      to be sure that the forest-keeper knew that the professor and his daughter\r\n\r\n      were going to dine in the laboratory, and how he had come to know it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When Monsieur Darzac had finished, I said: \u201cThe examination has not\r\n\r\n      advanced the problem much.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt has put it back,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt has thrown light upon it,\u201d said Rouletabille, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER IX. Reporter and Detective\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The three of us went back towards the pavilion. At some distance from the\r\n\r\n      building the reporter made us stop and, pointing to a small clump of trees\r\n\r\n      to the right of us, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s where the murderer came from to get into the pavilion.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As there were other patches of trees of the same sort between the great\r\n\r\n      oaks, I asked why the murderer had chosen that one, rather than any of the\r\n\r\n      others. Rouletabille answered me by pointing to the path which ran quite\r\n\r\n      close to the thicket to the door of the pavilion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat path is as you see, topped with gravel,\u201d he said; \u201cthe man must have\r\n\r\n      passed along it going to the pavilion, since no traces of his steps have\r\n\r\n      been found on the soft ground. The man didn\u2019t have wings; he walked; but\r\n\r\n      he walked on the gravel which left no impression of his tread. The gravel\r\n\r\n      has, in fact, been trodden by many other feet, since the path is the most\r\n\r\n      direct way between the pavilion and the chateau. As to the thicket, made\r\n\r\n      of the sort of shrubs that don\u2019t flourish in the rough season\u2014laurels\r\n\r\n      and fuchsias\u2014it offered the murderer a sufficient hiding-place until\r\n\r\n      it was time for him to make his way to the pavilion. It was while hiding\r\n\r\n      in that clump of trees that he saw Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson,\r\n\r\n      and then Daddy Jacques, leave the pavilion. Gravel has been spread nearly,\r\n\r\n      very nearly, up to the windows of the pavilion. The footprints of a man,\r\n\r\n      parallel with the wall\u2014marks which we will examine presently, and\r\n\r\n      which I have already seen\u2014prove that he only needed to make one\r\n\r\n      stride to find himself in front of the vestibule window, left open by\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques. The man drew himself up by his hands and entered the\r\n\r\n      vestibule.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter all it is very possible,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter all what? After all what?\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I begged of him not to be angry; but he was too much irritated to listen\r\n\r\n      to me and declared, ironically, that he admired the prudent doubt with\r\n\r\n      which certain people approached the most simple problems, risking nothing\r\n\r\n      by saying \u201cthat is so, or \u2018that is not so.\u201d Their intelligence would have\r\n\r\n      produced about the same result if nature had forgotten to furnish their\r\n\r\n      brain-pan with a little grey matter. As I appeared vexed, my young friend\r\n\r\n      took me by the arm and admitted that he had not meant that for me; he\r\n\r\n      thought more of me than that.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I did not reason as I do in regard to this gravel,\u201d he went on, \u201cI\r\n\r\n      should have to assume a balloon!\u2014My dear fellow, the science of the\r\n\r\n      aerostation of dirigible balloons is not yet developed enough for me to\r\n\r\n      consider it and suppose that a murderer would drop from the clouds! So\r\n\r\n      don\u2019t say a thing is possible, when it could not be otherwise. We know now\r\n\r\n      how the man entered by the window, and we also know the moment at which he\r\n\r\n      entered,\u2014during the five o\u2019clock walk of the professor and his\r\n\r\n      daughter. The fact of the presence of the chambermaid\u2014who had come\r\n\r\n      to clean up \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\u2014in the laboratory, when Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and his daughter returned from their walk, at half-past one,\r\n\r\n      permits us to affirm that at half-past one the murderer was not in the\r\n\r\n      chamber under the bed, unless he was in collusion with the chambermaid.\r\n\r\n      What do you say, Monsieur Darzac?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac shook his head and said he was sure of the chambermaid\u2019s\r\n\r\n      fidelity, and that she was a thoroughly honest and devoted servant.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBesides,\u201d he added, \u201cat five o\u2019clock Monsieur Stangerson went into the\r\n\r\n      room to fetch his daughter\u2019s hat.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is that also,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat the man entered by the window at the time you say, I admit,\u201d I said;\r\n\r\n      \u201cbut why did he shut the window? It was an act which would necessarily\r\n\r\n      draw the attention of those who had left it open.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt may be the window was not shut at once,\u201d replied the young reporter.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut if he did shut the window, it was because of the bend in the gravel\r\n\r\n      path, a dozen yards from the pavilion, and on account of the three oaks\r\n\r\n      that are growing at that spot.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d asked Monsieur Darzac, who had followed us and\r\n\r\n      listened with almost breathless attention to all that Rouletabille had\r\n\r\n      said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll explain all to you later on, Monsieur, when I think the moment to be\r\n\r\n      ripe for doing so; but I don\u2019t think I have anything of more importance to\r\n\r\n      say on this affair, if my hypothesis is justified.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what is your hypothesis?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will never know if it does not turn out to be the truth. It is of\r\n\r\n      much too grave a nature to speak of it, so long as it continues to be only\r\n\r\n      a hypothesis.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you, at least, some idea as to who the murderer is?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur, I don\u2019t know who the murderer is; but don\u2019t be afraid,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2014I shall know.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I could not but observe that Monsieur Darzac was deeply moved; and I\r\n\r\n      suspected that Rouletabille\u2019s confident assertion was not pleasing to him.\r\n\r\n      Why, I asked myself, if he was really afraid that the murderer should be\r\n\r\n      discovered, was he helping the reporter to find him? My young friend\r\n\r\n      seemed to have received the same impression, for he said, bluntly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac, don\u2019t you want me to find out who the murderer was?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh!\u2014I should like to kill him with my own hand!\u201d cried Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s fiance, with a vehemence that amazed me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Rouletabille gravely; \u201cbut you have not answered my\r\n\r\n      question.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were passing by the thicket, of which the young reporter had spoken to\r\n\r\n      us a minute before. I entered it and pointed out evident traces of a man\r\n\r\n      who had been hidden there. Rouletabille, once more, was right.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes!\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do with a thing of flesh and blood, who\r\n\r\n      uses the same means that we do. It\u2019ll all come out on those lines.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having said this, he asked me for the paper pattern of the footprint which\r\n\r\n      he had given me to take care of, and applied it to a very clear footmark\r\n\r\n      behind the thicket. \u201cAha!\u201d he said, rising.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I thought he was now going to trace back the track of the murderer\u2019s\r\n\r\n      footmarks to the vestibule window; but he led us instead, far to the left,\r\n\r\n      saying that it was useless ferreting in the mud, and that he was sure,\r\n\r\n      now, of the road taken by the murderer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe went along the wall to the hedge and dry ditch, over which he jumped.\r\n\r\n      See, just in front of the little path leading to the lake, that was his\r\n\r\n      nearest way to get out.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know he went to the lake?\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause Frederic Larsan has not quitted the borders of it since this\r\n\r\n      morning. There must be some important marks there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A few minutes later we reached the lake.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was a little sheet of marshy water, surrounded by reeds, on which\r\n\r\n      floated some dead water-lily leaves. The great Fred may have seen us\r\n\r\n      approaching, but we probably interested him very little, for he took\r\n\r\n      hardly any notice of us and continued to be stirring with his cane\r\n\r\n      something which we could not see.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook!\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201chere again are the footmarks of the escaping\r\n\r\n      man; they skirt the lake here and finally disappear just before this path,\r\n\r\n      which leads to the high road to Epinay. The man continued his flight to\r\n\r\n      Paris.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d I asked, \u201csince these footmarks are not\r\n\r\n      continued on the path?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat makes me think that?\u2014Why these footprints, which I expected to\r\n\r\n      find!\u201d he cried, pointing to the sharply outlined imprint of a neat boot.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSee!\u201d\u2014and he called to Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Fred, these neat footprints seem to have been made since the\r\n\r\n      discovery of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, young man, yes, they have been carefully made,\u201d replied Fred without\r\n\r\n      raising his head. \u201cYou see, there are steps that come, and steps that go\r\n\r\n      back.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the man had a bicycle!\u201d cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here, after looking at the marks of the bicycle, which followed, going and\r\n\r\n      coming, the neat footprints, I thought I might intervene.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe bicycle explains the disappearance of the murderer\u2019s big\r\n\r\n      foot-prints,\u201d I said. \u201cThe murderer, with his rough boots, mounted a\r\n\r\n      bicycle. His accomplice, the wearer of the neat boots, had come to wait\r\n\r\n      for him on the edge of the lake with the bicycle. It might be supposed\r\n\r\n      that the murderer was working for the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no!\u201d replied Rouletabille with a strange smile. \u201cI have expected to\r\n\r\n      find these footmarks from the very beginning. These are not the footmarks\r\n\r\n      of the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen there were two?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo\u2014there was but one, and he had no accomplice.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good!\u2014Very good!\u201d cried Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook!\u201d continued the young reporter, showing us the ground where it had\r\n\r\n      been disturbed by big and heavy heels; \u201cthe man seated himself there, and\r\n\r\n      took off his hobnailed boots, which he had worn only for the purpose of\r\n\r\n      misleading detection, and then no doubt, taking them away with him, he\r\n\r\n      stood up in his own boots, and quietly and slowly regained the high road,\r\n\r\n      holding his bicycle in his hand, for he could not venture to ride it on\r\n\r\n      this rough path. That accounts for the lightness of the impression made by\r\n\r\n      the wheels along it, in spite of the softness of the ground. If there had\r\n\r\n      been a man on the bicycle, the wheels would have sunk deeply into the\r\n\r\n      soil. No, no; there was but one man there, the murderer on foot.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBravo!\u2014bravo!\u201d cried Fred again, and coming suddenly towards us\r\n\r\n      and, planting himself in front of Monsieur Robert Darzac, he said to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we had a bicycle here, we might demonstrate the correctness of the\r\n\r\n      young man\u2019s reasoning, Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do you know whether there\r\n\r\n      is one at the chateau?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo!\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac. \u201cThere is not. I took mine, four days ago,\r\n\r\n      to Paris, the last time I came to the chateau before the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a pity!\u201d replied Fred, very coldly. Then, turning to Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      he said: \u201cIf we go on at this rate, we\u2019ll both come to the same\r\n\r\n      conclusion. Have you any idea, as to how the murderer got away from The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said my young friend; \u201cI have an idea.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo have I,\u201d said Fred, \u201cand it must be the same as yours. There are no\r\n\r\n      two ways of reasoning in this affair. I am waiting for the arrival of my\r\n\r\n      chief before offering any explanation to the examining magistrate.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! Is the Chief of the Surete coming?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, this afternoon. He is going to summon, before the magistrate, in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory, all those who have played any part in this tragedy. It will be\r\n\r\n      very interesting. It is a pity you won\u2019t be able to be present.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall be present,\u201d said Rouletabille confidently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cReally\u2014you are an extraordinary fellow\u2014for your age!\u201d replied\r\n\r\n      the detective in a tone not wholly free from irony. \u201cYou\u2019d make a\r\n\r\n      wonderful detective\u2014if you had a little more method\u2014if you\r\n\r\n      didn\u2019t follow your instincts and that bump on your forehead. As I have\r\n\r\n      already several times observed, Monsieur Rouletabille, you reason too\r\n\r\n      much; you do not allow yourself to be guided by what you have seen. What\r\n\r\n      do you say to the handkerchief full of blood, and the red mark of the hand\r\n\r\n      on the wall? You have seen the stain on the wall, but I have only seen the\r\n\r\n      handkerchief.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBah!\u201d cried Rouletabille, \u201cthe murderer was wounded in the hand by\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s revolver!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u2014a simply instinctive observation! Take care!\u2014You are\r\n\r\n      becoming too strictly logical, Monsieur Rouletabille; logic will upset you\r\n\r\n      if you use it indiscriminately. You are right, when you say that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson fired her revolver, but you are wrong when you say\r\n\r\n      that she wounded the murderer in the hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure of it,\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Fred, imperturbable, interrupted him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDefective observation\u2014defective observation!\u2014the examination\r\n\r\n      of the handkerchief, the numberless little round scarlet stains, the\r\n\r\n      impression of drops which I found in the tracks of the footprints, at the\r\n\r\n      moment when they were made on the floor, prove to me that the murderer was\r\n\r\n      not wounded at all. Monsieur Rouletabille, the murderer bled at the nose!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The great Fred spoke quite seriously. However, I could not refrain from\r\n\r\n      uttering an exclamation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter looked gravely at Fred, who looked gravely at him. And Fred\r\n\r\n      immediately concluded:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man allowed the blood to flow into his hand and handkerchief, and\r\n\r\n      dried his hand on the wall. The fact is highly important,\u201d he added,\r\n\r\n      \u201cbecause there is no need of his being wounded in the hand for him to be\r\n\r\n      the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille seemed to be thinking deeply. After a moment he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is something\u2014a something, Monsieur Frederic Larsan, much\r\n\r\n      graver than the misuse of logic the disposition of mind in some detectives\r\n\r\n      which makes them, in perfect good faith, twist logic to the necessities of\r\n\r\n      their preconceived ideas. You, already, have your idea about the murderer,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Fred. Don\u2019t deny it; and your theory demands that the murderer\r\n\r\n      should not have been wounded in the hand, otherwise it comes to nothing.\r\n\r\n      And you have searched, and have found something else. It\u2019s dangerous, very\r\n\r\n      dangerous, Monsieur Fred, to go from a preconceived idea to find the\r\n\r\n      proofs to fit it. That method may lead you far astray Beware of judicial\r\n\r\n      error, Monsieur Fred, it will trip you up!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And laughing a little, in a slightly bantering tone, his hands in his\r\n\r\n      pockets, Rouletabille fixed his cunning eyes on the great Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan silently contemplated the young reporter who pretended to\r\n\r\n      be as wise as himself. Shrugging his shoulders, he bowed to us and moved\r\n\r\n      quickly away, hitting the stones on his path with his stout cane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille watched his retreat, and then turned toward us, his face\r\n\r\n      joyous and triumphant.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall beat him!\u201d he cried. \u201cI shall beat the great Fred, clever as he\r\n\r\n      is; I shall beat them all!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he danced a double shuffle. Suddenly he stopped. My eyes followed his\r\n\r\n      gaze; they were fixed on Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was looking anxiously\r\n\r\n      at the impression left by his feet side by side with the elegant\r\n\r\n      footmarks. There was not a particle of difference between them!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We thought he was about to faint. His eyes, bulging with terror, avoided\r\n\r\n      us, while his right hand, with a spasmodic movement, twitched at the beard\r\n\r\n      that covered his honest, gentle, and now despairing face. At length\r\n\r\n      regaining his self-possession, he bowed to us, and remarking, in a changed\r\n\r\n      voice, that he was obliged to return to the chateau, left us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe deuce!\u201d exclaimed Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He, also, appeared to be deeply concerned. From his pocket-book he took a\r\n\r\n      piece of white paper as I had seen him do before, and with his scissors,\r\n\r\n      cut out the shape of the neat bootmarks that were on the ground. Then he\r\n\r\n      fitted the new paper pattern with the one he had previously made\u2014the\r\n\r\n      two were exactly alike. Rising, Rouletabille exclaimed again: \u201cThe deuce!\u201d\r\n\r\n       Presently he added: \u201cYet I believe Monsieur Robert Darzac to be an honest\r\n\r\n      man.\u201d He then led me on the road to the Donjon Inn, which we could see on\r\n\r\n      the highway, by the side of a small clump of trees.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER X. \u201cWe Shall Have to Eat Red Meat\u2014Now\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Donjon Inn was of no imposing appearance; but I like these buildings\r\n\r\n      with their rafters blackened with age and the smoke of their hearths\u2014these\r\n\r\n      inns of the coaching-days, crumbling erections that will soon exist in the\r\n\r\n      memory only. They belong to the bygone days, they are linked with history.\r\n\r\n      They make us think of the Road, of those days when highwaymen rode.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I saw at once that the Donjon Inn was at least two centuries old\u2014perhaps\r\n\r\n      older. Under its sign-board, over the threshold, a man with a\r\n\r\n      crabbed-looking face was standing, seemingly plunged in unpleasant\r\n\r\n      thought, if the wrinkles on his forehead and the knitting of his brows\r\n\r\n      were any indication.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When we were close to him, he deigned to see us and asked us, in a tone\r\n\r\n      anything but engaging, whether we wanted anything. He was, no doubt, the\r\n\r\n      not very amiable landlord of this charming dwelling-place. As we expressed\r\n\r\n      a hope that he would be good enough to furnish us with a breakfast, he\r\n\r\n      assured us that he had no provisions, regarding us, as he said this, with\r\n\r\n      a look that was unmistakably suspicious.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou may take us in,\u201d Rouletabille said to him, \u201cwe are not policemen.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the police\u2014I\u2019m not afraid of anyone!\u201d replied the\r\n\r\n      man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I had made my friend understand by a sign that we should do better not to\r\n\r\n      insist; but, being determined to enter the inn, he slipped by the man on\r\n\r\n      the doorstep and was in the common room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201cit is very comfortable here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A good fire was blazing in the chimney, and we held our hands to the\r\n\r\n      warmth it sent out; it was a morning in which the approach of winter was\r\n\r\n      unmistakable. The room was a tolerably large one, furnished with two heavy\r\n\r\n      tables, some stools, a counter decorated with rows of bottles of syrup and\r\n\r\n      alcohol. Three windows looked out on to the road. A coloured advertisement\r\n\r\n      lauded the many merits of a new vermouth. On the mantelpiece was arrayed\r\n\r\n      the innkeeper\u2019s collection of figured earthenware pots and stone jugs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a fine fire for roasting a chicken,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cWe have\r\n\r\n      no chicken\u2014not even a wretched rabbit,\u201d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know,\u201d said my friend slowly; \u201cI know\u2014We shall have to eat red\r\n\r\n      meat\u2014now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I confess I did not in the least understand what Rouletabille meant by\r\n\r\n      what he had said; but the landlord, as soon as he heard the words, uttered\r\n\r\n      an oath, which he at once stifled, and placed himself at our orders as\r\n\r\n      obediently as Monsieur Robert Darzac had done, when he heard\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s prophetic sentence\u2014\u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing\r\n\r\n      of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.\u201d Certainly my friend knew how\r\n\r\n      to make people understand him by the use of wholly incomprehensible\r\n\r\n      phrases. I observed as much to him, but he merely smiled. I should have\r\n\r\n      proposed that he give me some explanation; but he put a finger to his\r\n\r\n      lips, which evidently signified that he had not only determined not to\r\n\r\n      speak, but also enjoined silence on my part.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Meantime the man had pushed open a little side door and called to somebody\r\n\r\n      to bring him half a dozen eggs and a piece of beefsteak. The commission\r\n\r\n      was quickly executed by a strongly-built young woman with beautiful blonde\r\n\r\n      hair and large, handsome eyes, who regarded us with curiosity.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The innkeeper said to her roughly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGet out!\u2014and if the Green Man comes, don\u2019t let me see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She disappeared. Rouletabille took the eggs, which had been brought to him\r\n\r\n      in a bowl, and the meat which was on a dish, placed all carefully beside\r\n\r\n      him in the chimney, unhooked a frying-pan and a gridiron, and began to\r\n\r\n      beat up our omelette before proceeding to grill our beefsteak. He then\r\n\r\n      ordered two bottles of cider, and seemed to take as little notice of our\r\n\r\n      host as our host did of him. The landlord let us do our own cooking and\r\n\r\n      set our table near one of the windows.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly I heard him mutter:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u2014there he is.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      His face had changed, expressing fierce hatred. He went and glued himself\r\n\r\n      to one of the windows, watching the road. There was no need for me to draw\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s attention; he had already left our omelette and had joined\r\n\r\n      the landlord at the window. I went with him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      A man dressed entirely in green velvet, his head covered with a huntsman\u2019s\r\n\r\n      cap of the same colour, was advancing leisurely, lighting a pipe as he\r\n\r\n      walked. He carried a fowling-piece slung at his back. His movements\r\n\r\n      displayed an almost aristocratic ease. He wore eye-glasses and appeared to\r\n\r\n      be about five and forty years of age. His hair as well as his moustache\r\n\r\n      were salt grey. He was remarkably handsome. As he passed near the inn, he\r\n\r\n      hesitated, as if asking himself whether or no he should enter it; gave a\r\n\r\n      glance towards us, took a few whiffs at his pipe, and then resumed his\r\n\r\n      walk at the same nonchalant pace.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and I looked at our host. His flashing eyes, his clenched\r\n\r\n      hands, his trembling lips, told us of the tumultuous feelings by which he\r\n\r\n      was being agitated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe has done well not to come in here to-day!\u201d he hissed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho is that man?\u201d asked Rouletabille, returning to his omelette.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Green Man,\u201d growled the innkeeper. \u201cDon\u2019t you know him? Then all the\r\n\r\n      better for you. He is not an acquaintance to make.\u2014Well, he is\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s forest-keeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t appear to like him very much?\u201d asked the reporter, pouring his\r\n\r\n      omelette into the frying-pan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNobody likes him, monsieur. He\u2019s an upstart who must once have had a\r\n\r\n      fortune of his own; and he forgives nobody because, in order to live, he\r\n\r\n      has been compelled to become a servant. A keeper is as much a servant as\r\n\r\n      any other, isn\u2019t he? Upon my word, one would say that he is the master of\r\n\r\n      the Glandier, and that all the land and woods belong to him. He\u2019ll not let\r\n\r\n      a poor creature eat a morsel of bread on the grass\u2014his grass!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoes he often come here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cToo often. But I\u2019ve made him understand that his face doesn\u2019t please me,\r\n\r\n      and, for a month past, he hasn\u2019t been here. The Donjon Inn has never\r\n\r\n      existed for him!\u2014he hasn\u2019t had time!\u2014been too much engaged in\r\n\r\n      paying court to the landlady of the Three Lilies at Saint-Michel. A bad\r\n\r\n      fellow!\u2014There isn\u2019t an honest man who can bear him. Why, the\r\n\r\n      concierges of the chateau would turn their eyes away from a picture of\r\n\r\n      him!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe concierges of the chateau are honest people, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, they are, as true as my name\u2019s Mathieu, monsieur. I believe them to\r\n\r\n      be honest.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYet they\u2019ve been arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does that prove?\u2014But I don\u2019t want to mix myself up in other\r\n\r\n      people\u2019s affairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what do you think of the murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf the murder of poor Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u2014A good girl much\r\n\r\n      loved everywhere in the country. That\u2019s what I think of it\u2014and many\r\n\r\n      things besides; but that\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot even mine?\u201d insisted Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The innkeeper looked at him sideways and said gruffly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot even yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The omelette ready, we sat down at table and were silently eating, when\r\n\r\n      the door was pushed open and an old woman, dressed in rags, leaning on a\r\n\r\n      stick, her head doddering, her white hair hanging loosely over her\r\n\r\n      wrinkled forehead, appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u2014there you are, Mother Angenoux!\u2014It\u2019s long since we saw\r\n\r\n      you last,\u201d said our host.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have been very ill, very nearly dying,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cIf ever\r\n\r\n      you should have any scraps for the Bete du Bon Dieu\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And she entered, followed by a cat, larger than any I had ever believed\r\n\r\n      could exist. The beast looked at us and gave so hopeless a miau that I\r\n\r\n      shuddered. I had never heard so lugubrious a cry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As if drawn by the cat\u2019s cry a man followed the old woman in. It was the\r\n\r\n      Green Man. He saluted by raising his hand to his cap and seated himself at\r\n\r\n      a table near to ours.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA glass of cider, Daddy Mathieu,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As the Green Man entered, Daddy Mathieu had started violently; but visibly\r\n\r\n      mastering himself he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve no more cider; I served the last bottles to these gentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen give me a glass of white wine,\u201d said the Green Man, without showing\r\n\r\n      the least surprise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve no more white wine\u2014no more anything,\u201d said Daddy Mathieu,\r\n\r\n      surlily.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow is Madame Mathieu?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite well, thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      So the young Woman with the large, tender eyes, whom we had just seen, was\r\n\r\n      the wife of this repugnant and brutal rustic, whose jealousy seemed to\r\n\r\n      emphasise his physical ugliness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Slamming the door behind him, the innkeeper left the room. Mother Angenoux\r\n\r\n      was still standing, leaning on her stick, the cat at her feet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ve been ill, Mother Angenoux?\u2014Is that why we have not seen you\r\n\r\n      for the last week?\u201d asked the Green Man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur keeper. I have been able to get up but three times, to go\r\n\r\n      to pray to Sainte-Genevieve, our good patroness, and the rest of the time\r\n\r\n      I have been lying on my bed. There was no one to care for me but the Bete\r\n\r\n      du bon Dieu!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid she not leave you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNeither by day nor by night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs I am of Paradise.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen how was it, Madame Angenoux, that all through the night of the\r\n\r\n      murder nothing but the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu was heard?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mother Angenoux planted herself in front of the forest-keeper and struck\r\n\r\n      the floor with her stick.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut shall I tell you\r\n\r\n      something? There are no two cats in the world that cry like that. Well, on\r\n\r\n      the night of the murder I also heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu\r\n\r\n      outside; and yet she was on my knees, and did not mew once, I swear. I\r\n\r\n      crossed myself when I heard that, as if I had heard the devil.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I looked at the keeper when he put the last question, and I am much\r\n\r\n      mistaken if I did not detect an evil smile on his lips. At that moment,\r\n\r\n      the noise of loud quarrelling reached us. We even thought we heard a dull\r\n\r\n      sound of blows, as if some one was being beaten. The Green Man quickly\r\n\r\n      rose and hurried to the door by the side of the fireplace; but it was\r\n\r\n      opened by the landlord who appeared, and said to the keeper:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t alarm yourself, Monsieur\u2014it is my wife; she has the\r\n\r\n      toothache.\u201d And he laughed. \u201cHere, Mother Angenoux, here are some scraps\r\n\r\n      for your cat.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He held out a packet to the old woman, who took it eagerly and went out by\r\n\r\n      the door, closely followed by her cat.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you won\u2019t serve me?\u201d asked the Green Man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Mathieu\u2019s face was placid and no longer retained its expression of\r\n\r\n      hatred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve nothing for you\u2014nothing for you. Take yourself off.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Green Man quietly refilled his pipe, lit it, bowed to us, and went\r\n\r\n      out. No sooner was he over the threshold than Daddy Mathieu slammed the\r\n\r\n      door after him and, turning towards us, with eyes bloodshot, and frothing\r\n\r\n      at the mouth, he hissed to us, shaking his clenched fist at the door he\r\n\r\n      had just shut on the man he evidently hated:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are who tell me \u2018We shall have to eat red meat\u2014now\u2019;\r\n\r\n      but if it will interest you to know it\u2014that man is the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      With which words Daddy Mathieu immediately left us. Rouletabille returned\r\n\r\n      towards the fireplace and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow we\u2019ll grill our steak. How do you like the cider?\u2014It\u2019s a little\r\n\r\n      tart, but I like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We saw no more of Daddy Mathieu that day, and absolute silence reigned in\r\n\r\n      the inn when we left it, after placing five francs on the table in payment\r\n\r\n      for our feast.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille at once set off on a three mile walk round Professor\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s estate. He halted for some ten minutes at the corner of a\r\n\r\n      narrow road black with soot, near to some charcoal-burners\u2019 huts in the\r\n\r\n      forest of Sainte-Genevieve, which touches on the road from Epinay to\r\n\r\n      Corbeil, to tell me that the murderer had certainly passed that way,\r\n\r\n      before entering the grounds and concealing himself in the little clump of\r\n\r\n      trees.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t think, then, that the keeper knows anything of it?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe shall see that, later,\u201d he replied. \u201cFor the present I\u2019m not\r\n\r\n      interested in what the landlord said about the man. The landlord hates\r\n\r\n      him. I didn\u2019t take you to breakfast at the Donjon Inn for the sake of the\r\n\r\n      Green Man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then Rouletabille, with great precaution glided, followed by me, towards\r\n\r\n      the little building which, standing near the park gate, served for the\r\n\r\n      home of the concierges, who had been arrested that morning. With the skill\r\n\r\n      of an acrobat, he got into the lodge by an upper window which had been\r\n\r\n      left open, and returned ten minutes later. He said only, \u201cAh!\u201d\u2014a\r\n\r\n      word which, in his mouth, signified many things.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were about to take the road leading to the chateau, when a considerable\r\n\r\n      stir at the park gate attracted our attention. A carriage had arrived and\r\n\r\n      some people had come from the chateau to meet it. Rouletabille pointed out\r\n\r\n      to me a gentleman who descended from it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s the Chief of the Surete\u201d he said. \u201cNow we shall see what Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan has up his sleeve, and whether he is so much cleverer than anybody\r\n\r\n      else.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The carriage of the Chief of the Surete was followed by three other\r\n\r\n      vehicles containing reporters, who were also desirous of entering the\r\n\r\n      park. But two gendarmes stationed at the gate had evidently received\r\n\r\n      orders to refuse admission to anybody. The Chief of the Surete calmed\r\n\r\n      their impatience by undertaking to furnish to the press, that evening, all\r\n\r\n      the information he could give that would not interfere with the judicial\r\n\r\n      inquiry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XI. In Which Frederic Larsan Explains How the Murderer Was Able to\r\n\r\n      Get Out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Among the mass of papers, legal documents, memoirs, and extracts from\r\n\r\n      newspapers, which I have collected, relating to the mystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room, there is one very interesting piece; it is a detail of the famous\r\n\r\n      examination which took place that afternoon, in the laboratory of\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson, before the Chief of the Surete. This narrative is\r\n\r\n      from the pen of Monsieur Maleine, the Registrar, who, like the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate, had spent some of his leisure time in the pursuit of\r\n\r\n      literature. The piece was to have made part of a book which, however, has\r\n\r\n      never been published, and which was to have been entitled: \u201cMy\r\n\r\n      Examinations.\u201d It was given to me by the Registrar himself, some time\r\n\r\n      after the astonishing denouement to this case, and is unique in judicial\r\n\r\n      chronicles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here it is. It is not a mere dry transcription of questions and answers,\r\n\r\n      because the Registrar often intersperses his story with his own personal\r\n\r\n      comments.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The examining magistrate and I (the writer relates) found ourselves in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room in the company of the builder who had constructed the pavilion\r\n\r\n      after Professor Stangerson\u2019s designs. He had a workman with him. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      de Marquet had had the walls laid entirely bare; that is to say, he had\r\n\r\n      had them stripped of the paper which had decorated them. Blows with a\r\n\r\n      pick, here and there, satisfied us of the absence of any sort of opening.\r\n\r\n      The floor and the ceiling were thoroughly sounded. We found nothing. There\r\n\r\n      was nothing to be found. Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be delighted and\r\n\r\n      never ceased repeating:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a case! What a case! We shall never know, you\u2019ll see, how the\r\n\r\n      murderer was able to get out of this room!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then suddenly, with a radiant face, he called to the officer in charge of\r\n\r\n      the gendarmes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo to the chateau,\u201d he said, \u201cand request Monsieur Stangerson and\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac to come to me in the laboratory, also Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques; and let your men bring here the two concierges.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Five minutes later all were assembled in the laboratory. The Chief of the\r\n\r\n      Surete, who had arrived at the Glandier, joined us at that moment. I was\r\n\r\n      seated at Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s desk ready for work, when Monsieur de\r\n\r\n      Marquet made us the following little speech\u2014as original as it was\r\n\r\n      unexpected:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith your permission, gentlemen\u2014as examinations lead to nothing\u2014we\r\n\r\n      will, for once, abandon the old system of interrogation. I will not have\r\n\r\n      you brought before me one by one, but we will all remain here as we are,\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, Monsieur Robert Darzac, Daddy Jacques and the two concierges,\r\n\r\n      the Chief of the Surete, the Registrar, and myself. We shall all be on the\r\n\r\n      same footing. The concierges may, for the moment, forget that they have\r\n\r\n      been arrested. We are going to confer together. We are on the spot where\r\n\r\n      the crime was committed. We have nothing else to discuss but the crime. So\r\n\r\n      let us discuss it freely\u2014intelligently or otherwise, so long as we\r\n\r\n      speak just what is in our minds. There need be no formality or method\r\n\r\n      since this won\u2019t help us in any way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, passing before me, he said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you think of that, eh? What a scene! Could you have thought of\r\n\r\n      that? I\u2019ll make a little piece out of it for the Vaudeville.\u201d And he\r\n\r\n      rubbed his hands with glee.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I turned my eyes on Monsieur Stangerson. The hope he had received from the\r\n\r\n      doctor\u2019s latest reports, which stated that Mademoiselle Stangerson might\r\n\r\n      recover from her wounds, had not been able to efface from his noble\r\n\r\n      features the marks of the great sorrow that was upon him. He had believed\r\n\r\n      his daughter to be dead, and he was still broken by that belief. His\r\n\r\n      clear, soft, blue eyes expressed infinite sorrow. I had had occasion, many\r\n\r\n      times, to see Monsieur Stangerson at public ceremonies, and from the first\r\n\r\n      had been struck by his countenance, which seemed as pure as that of a\r\n\r\n      child\u2014the dreamy gaze with the sublime and mystical expression of\r\n\r\n      the inventor and thinker.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On those occasions his daughter was always to be seen either following him\r\n\r\n      or by his side; for they never quitted each other, it was said, and had\r\n\r\n      shared the same labours for many years. The young lady, who was then five\r\n\r\n      and thirty, though she looked no more than thirty, had devoted herself\r\n\r\n      entirely to science. She still won admiration for her imperial beauty\r\n\r\n      which had remained intact, without a wrinkle, withstanding time and love.\r\n\r\n      Who would have dreamed that I should one day be seated by her pillow with\r\n\r\n      my papers, and that I should see her, on the point of death, painfully\r\n\r\n      recounting to us the most monstrous and most mysterious crime I have heard\r\n\r\n      of in my career? Who would have thought that I should be, that afternoon,\r\n\r\n      listening to the despairing father vainly trying to explain how his\r\n\r\n      daughter\u2019s assailant had been able to escape from him? Why bury ourselves\r\n\r\n      with our work in obscure retreats in the depths of woods, if it may not\r\n\r\n      protect us against those dangerous threats to life which meet us in the\r\n\r\n      busy cities?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, Monsieur Stangerson,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet, with somewhat of an\r\n\r\n      important air, \u201cplace yourself exactly where you were when Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson left you to go to her chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson rose and, standing at a certain distance from the door\r\n\r\n      of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, said, in an even voice and without the least trace of\r\n\r\n      emphasis\u2014a voice which I can only describe as a dead voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was here. About eleven o\u2019clock, after I had made a brief chemical\r\n\r\n      experiment at the furnaces of the laboratory, needing all the space behind\r\n\r\n      me, I had my desk moved here by Daddy Jacques, who spent the evening in\r\n\r\n      cleaning some of my apparatus. My daughter had been working at the same\r\n\r\n      desk with me. When it was her time to leave she rose, kissed me, and bade\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques goodnight. She had to pass behind my desk and the door to\r\n\r\n      enter her chamber, and she could do this only with some difficulty. That\r\n\r\n      is to say, I was very near the place where the crime occurred later.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the desk?\u201d I asked, obeying, in thus mixing myself in the\r\n\r\n      conversation, the express orders of my chief, \u201cas soon as you heard the\r\n\r\n      cry of \u2018murder\u2019 followed by the revolver shots, what became of the desk?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques answered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe pushed it back against the wall, here\u2014close to where it is at\r\n\r\n      the present moment\u2014so as to be able to get at the door at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I followed up my reasoning, to which, however, I attached but little\r\n\r\n      importance, regarding it as only a weak hypothesis, with another question.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMight not a man in the room, the desk being so near to the door, by\r\n\r\n      stooping and slipping under the desk, have left it unobserved?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are forgetting,\u201d interrupted Monsieur Stangerson wearily, \u201cthat my\r\n\r\n      daughter had locked and bolted her door, that the door had remained\r\n\r\n      fastened, that we vainly tried to force it open when we heard the noise,\r\n\r\n      and that we were at the door while the struggle between the murderer and\r\n\r\n      my poor child was going on\u2014immediately after we heard her stifled\r\n\r\n      cries as she was being held by the fingers that have left their red mark\r\n\r\n      upon her throat. Rapid as the attack was, we were no less rapid in our\r\n\r\n      endeavors to get into the room where the tragedy was taking place.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I rose from my seat and once more examined the door with the greatest\r\n\r\n      care. Then I returned to my place with a despairing gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf the lower panel of the door,\u201d I said, \u201ccould be removed without the\r\n\r\n      whole door being necessarily opened, the problem would be solved. But,\r\n\r\n      unfortunately, that last hypothesis is untenable after an examination of\r\n\r\n      the door\u2014it\u2019s of oak, solid and massive. You can see that quite\r\n\r\n      plainly, in spite of the injury done in the attempt to burst it open.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d cried Daddy Jacques, \u201cit is an old and solid door that was brought\r\n\r\n      from the chateau\u2014they don\u2019t make such doors now. We had to use this\r\n\r\n      bar of iron to get it open, all four of us\u2014for the concierge, brave\r\n\r\n      woman she is, helped us. It pains me to find them both in prison now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques had no sooner uttered these words of pity and protestation\r\n\r\n      than tears and lamentations broke out from the concierges. I never saw two\r\n\r\n      accused people crying more bitterly. I was extremely disgusted. Even if\r\n\r\n      they were innocent, I could not understand how they could behave like that\r\n\r\n      in the face of misfortune. A dignified bearing at such times is better\r\n\r\n      than tears and groans, which, most often, are feigned.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow then, enough of that sniveling,\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet; \u201cand, in\r\n\r\n      your interest, tell us what you were doing under the windows of the\r\n\r\n      pavilion at the time your mistress was being attacked; for you were close\r\n\r\n      to the pavilion when Daddy Jacques met you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe were coming to help!\u201d they whined.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we could only lay hands on the murderer, he\u2019d never taste bread\r\n\r\n      again!\u201d the woman gurgled between her sobs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As before we were unable to get two connecting thoughts out of them. They\r\n\r\n      persisted in their denials and swore, by heaven and all the saints, that\r\n\r\n      they were in bed when they heard the sound of the revolver shot.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was not one, but two shots that were fired!\u2014You see, you are\r\n\r\n      lying. If you had heard one, you would have heard the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMon Dieu! Monsieur\u2014it was the second shot we heard. We were asleep\r\n\r\n      when the first shot was fired.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwo shots were fired,\u201d said Daddy Jacques. \u201cI am certain that all the\r\n\r\n      cartridges were in my revolver. We found afterward that two had been\r\n\r\n      exploded, and we heard two shots behind the door. Was not that so,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Professor, \u201cthere were two shots, one dull, and the\r\n\r\n      other sharp and ringing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy do you persist in lying?\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet, turning to the\r\n\r\n      concierges. \u201cDo you think the police are the fools you are? Everything\r\n\r\n      points to the fact that you were out of doors and near the pavilion at the\r\n\r\n      time of the tragedy. What were you doing there? So far as I am concerned,\u201d\r\n\r\n       he said, turning to Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cI can only explain the escape of\r\n\r\n      the murderer on the assumption of help from these two accomplices. As soon\r\n\r\n      as the door was forced open, and while you, Monsieur Stangerson, were\r\n\r\n      occupied with your unfortunate child, the concierge and his wife\r\n\r\n      facilitated the flight of the murderer, who, screening himself behind\r\n\r\n      them, reached the window in the vestibule, and sprang out of it into the\r\n\r\n      park. The concierge closed the window after him and fastened the blinds,\r\n\r\n      which certainly could not have closed and fastened of themselves. That is\r\n\r\n      the conclusion I have arrived at. If anyone here has any other idea, let\r\n\r\n      him state it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson intervened:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat you say was impossible. I do not believe either in the guilt or in\r\n\r\n      the connivance of my concierges, though I cannot understand what they were\r\n\r\n      doing in the park at that late hour of the night. I say it was impossible,\r\n\r\n      because Madame Bernier held the lamp and did not move from the threshold\r\n\r\n      of the room; because I, as soon as the door was forced open, threw myself\r\n\r\n      on my knees beside my daughter, and no one could have left or entered the\r\n\r\n      room by the door, without passing over her body and forcing his way by me!\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques and the concierge had but to cast a glance round the chamber\r\n\r\n      and under the bed, as I had done on entering, to see that there was nobody\r\n\r\n      in it but my daughter lying on the floor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you think, Monsieur Darzac?\u201d asked the magistrate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac replied that he had no opinion to express. Monsieur Dax,\r\n\r\n      the Chief of the Surete who, so far, had been listening and examining the\r\n\r\n      room, at length deigned to open his lips:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhile search is being made for the criminal, we had better try to find\r\n\r\n      out the motive for the crime; that will advance us a little,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n      Turning towards Monsieur Stangerson, he continued, in the even,\r\n\r\n      intelligent tone indicative of a strong character, \u201cI understand that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle was shortly to have been married?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The professor looked sadly at Monsieur Robert Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo my friend here, whom I should have been happy to call my son\u2014to\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson is much better and is rapidly recovering from her\r\n\r\n      wounds. The marriage is simply delayed, is it not, Monsieur?\u201d insisted the\r\n\r\n      Chief of the Surete.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope so.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! Is there any doubt about that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson did not answer. Monsieur Robert Darzac seemed\r\n\r\n      agitated. I saw that his hand trembled as it fingered his watchchain.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Dax coughed, as did Monsieur de Marquet. Both were evidently\r\n\r\n      embarrassed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou understand, Monsieur Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201cthat in an affair so\r\n\r\n      perplexing as this, we cannot neglect anything; we must know all, even the\r\n\r\n      smallest and seemingly most futile thing concerning the victim\u2014information\r\n\r\n      apparently the most insignificant. Why do you doubt that this marriage\r\n\r\n      will take place? You expressed a hope; but the hope implies a doubt. Why\r\n\r\n      do you doubt?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson made a visible effort to recover himself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou are right. It will be best that\r\n\r\n      you should know something which, if I concealed it, might appear to be of\r\n\r\n      importance; Monsieur Darzac agrees with me in this.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac, whose pallor at that moment seemed to me to be altogether\r\n\r\n      abnormal, made a sign of assent. I gathered he was unable to speak.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI want you to know then,\u201d continued Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cthat my\r\n\r\n      daughter has sworn never to leave me, and adheres firmly to her oath, in\r\n\r\n      spite of all my prayers and all that I have argued to induce her to marry.\r\n\r\n      We have known Monsieur Robert Darzac many years. He loves my child; and I\r\n\r\n      believed that she loved him; because she only recently consented to this\r\n\r\n      marriage which I desire with all my heart. I am an old man, Monsieur, and\r\n\r\n      it was a happy hour to me when I knew that, after I had gone, she would\r\n\r\n      have at her side, one who loved her and who would help her in continuing\r\n\r\n      our common labours. I love and esteem Monsieur Darzac both for his\r\n\r\n      greatness of heart and for his devotion to science. But, two days before\r\n\r\n      the tragedy, for I know not what reason, my daughter declared to me that\r\n\r\n      she would never marry Monsieur Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A dead silence followed Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s words. It was a moment\r\n\r\n      fraught with suspense.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid Mademoiselle give you any explanation,\u2014did she tell you what\r\n\r\n      her motive was?\u201d asked Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe told me she was too old to marry\u2014that she had waited too long.\r\n\r\n      She said she had given much thought to the matter and while she had a\r\n\r\n      great esteem, even affection, for Monsieur Darzac, she felt it would be\r\n\r\n      better if things remained as they were. She would be happy, she said, to\r\n\r\n      see the relations between ourselves and Monsieur Darzac become closer, but\r\n\r\n      only on the understanding that there would be no more talk of marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is very strange!\u201d muttered Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStrange!\u201d repeated Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll certainly not find the motive there, Monsieur Dax,\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson said with a cold smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn any case, the motive was not theft!\u201d said the Chief impatiently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! we are quite convinced of that!\u201d cried the examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment the door of the laboratory opened and the officer in charge\r\n\r\n      of the gendarmes entered and handed a card to the examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet read it and uttered a half angry exclamation:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is really too much!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the Chief.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s the card of a young reporter engaged on the \u2018Epoque,\u2019 a Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Joseph Rouletabille. It has these words written on it: \u2018One of the motives\r\n\r\n      of the crime was robbery.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Chief smiled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u2014young Rouletabille\u2014I\u2019ve heard of him he is considered\r\n\r\n      rather clever. Let him come in.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille was allowed to enter. I had made his\r\n\r\n      acquaintance in the train that morning on the way to Epinay-sur-Orge. He\r\n\r\n      had introduced himself almost against my wish into our compartment. I had\r\n\r\n      better say at once that his manners, and the arrogance with which he\r\n\r\n      assumed to know what was incomprehensible even to us, impressed him\r\n\r\n      unfavourably on my mind. I do not like journalists. They are a class of\r\n\r\n      writers to be avoided as the pest. They think that everything is\r\n\r\n      permissible and they respect nothing. Grant them the least favour, allow\r\n\r\n      them even to approach you, and you never can tell what annoyance they may\r\n\r\n      give you. This one appears to be scarcely twenty years old, and the\r\n\r\n      effrontery with which he dared to question us and discuss the matter with\r\n\r\n      us made him particularly obnoxious to me. Besides, he had a way of\r\n\r\n      expressing himself that left us guessing as to whether he was mocking us\r\n\r\n      or not. I know quite well that the \u2018Epoque\u2019 is an influential paper with\r\n\r\n      which it is well to be on good terms, but the paper ought not to allow\r\n\r\n      itself to be represented by sneaking reporters.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille entered the laboratory, bowed to us, and\r\n\r\n      waited for Monsieur de Marquet to ask him to explain his presence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou pretend, Monsieur, that you know the motive for the crime, and that\r\n\r\n      that motive\u2014in the face of all the evidence that has been\r\n\r\n      forthcoming\u2014was robbery?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur, I do not pretend that. I do not say that robbery was the\r\n\r\n      motive for the crime, and I don\u2019t believe it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, what is the meaning of this card?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt means that robbery was one of the motives for the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat leads you to think that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you will be good enough to accompany me, I will show you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The young man asked us to follow him into the vestibule, and we did. He\r\n\r\n      led us towards the lavatory and begged Monsieur de Marquet to kneel beside\r\n\r\n      him. This lavatory is lit by the glass door, and, when the door was open,\r\n\r\n      the light which penetrated was sufficient to light it perfectly. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      de Marquet and Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille knelt down on the threshold,\r\n\r\n      and the young man pointed to a spot on the pavement.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe stones of the lavatory have not been washed by Daddy Jacques for some\r\n\r\n      time,\u201d he said; \u201cthat can be seen by the layer of dust that covers them.\r\n\r\n      Now, notice here, the marks of two large footprints and the black ash they\r\n\r\n      left where they have been. That ash is nothing else than the charcoal dust\r\n\r\n      that covers the path along which you must pass through the forest, in\r\n\r\n      order to get directly from Epinay to the Glandier. You know there is a\r\n\r\n      little village of charcoal-burners at that place, who make large\r\n\r\n      quantities of charcoal. What the murderer did was to come here at midday,\r\n\r\n      when there was nobody at the pavilion, and attempt his robbery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what robbery?\u2014Where do you see any signs of robbery? What\r\n\r\n      proves to you that a robbery has been committed?\u201d we all cried at once.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat put me on the trace of it,\u201d continued the journalist...\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWas this?\u201d interrupted Monsieur de Marquet, still on his knees.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Monsieur de Marquet explained that there were on the dust of the\r\n\r\n      pavement marks of two footsteps, as well as the impression, freshly-made,\r\n\r\n      of a heavy rectangular parcel, the marks of the cord with which it had\r\n\r\n      been fastened being easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have been here, then, Monsieur Rouletabille? I thought I had given\r\n\r\n      orders to Daddy Jacques, who was left in charge of the pavilion, not to\r\n\r\n      allow anybody to enter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t scold Daddy Jacques, I came here with Monsieur Robert Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u2014Indeed!\u201d exclaimed Monsieur de Marquet, disagreeably, casting a\r\n\r\n      side-glance at Monsieur Darzac, who remained perfectly silent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I saw the mark of the parcel by the side of the footprints, I had no\r\n\r\n      doubt as to the robbery,\u201d replied Monsieur Rouletabille. \u201cThe thief had\r\n\r\n      not brought a parcel with him; he had made one here\u2014a parcel with\r\n\r\n      the stolen objects, no doubt; and he put it in this corner intending to\r\n\r\n      take it away when the moment came for him to make his escape. He had also\r\n\r\n      placed his heavy boots beside the parcel,\u2014for, see\u2014there are\r\n\r\n      no marks of steps leading to the marks left by the boots, which were\r\n\r\n      placed side by side. That accounts for the fact that the murderer left no\r\n\r\n      trace of his steps when he fled from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, nor any in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory, nor in the vestibule. After entering \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d in his\r\n\r\n      boots, he took them off, finding them troublesome, or because he wished to\r\n\r\n      make as little noise as possible. The marks made by him in going through\r\n\r\n      the vestibule and the laboratory were subsequently washed out by Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques. Having, for some reason or other, taken off his boots, the\r\n\r\n      murderer carried them in his hand and placed them by the side of the\r\n\r\n      parcel he had made,\u2014by that time the robbery had been accomplished.\r\n\r\n      The man then returned to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and slipped under the bed, where\r\n\r\n      the mark of his body is perfectly visible on the floor and even on the\r\n\r\n      mat, which has been slightly moved from its place and creased. Fragments\r\n\r\n      of straw also, recently torn, bear witness to the murderer\u2019s movements\r\n\r\n      under the bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u2014we know all about that,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe robber had another motive for returning to hide under the bed,\u201d\r\n\r\n       continued the astonishing boy-journalist. \u201cYou might think that he was\r\n\r\n      trying to hide himself quickly on seeing, through the vestibule window,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson about to enter the pavilion. It would\r\n\r\n      have been much easier for him to have climbed up to the attic and hidden\r\n\r\n      there, waiting for an opportunity to get away, if his purpose had been\r\n\r\n      only flight.\u2014No! No!\u2014he had to be in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the Chief intervened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s not at all bad, young man. I compliment you. If we do not know yet\r\n\r\n      how the murderer succeeded in getting away, we can at any rate see how he\r\n\r\n      came in and committed the robbery. But what did he steal?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSomething very valuable,\u201d replied the young reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment we heard a cry from the laboratory. We rushed in and found\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson, his eyes haggard, his limbs trembling, pointing to a\r\n\r\n      sort of bookcase which he had opened, and which, we saw, was empty. At the\r\n\r\n      same instant he sank into the large armchair that was placed before the\r\n\r\n      desk and groaned, the tears rolling down his cheeks, \u201cI have been robbed\r\n\r\n      again! For God\u2019s sake, do not say a word of this to my daughter. She would\r\n\r\n      be more pained than I am.\u201d He heaved a deep sigh and added, in a tone I\r\n\r\n      shall never forget: \u201cAfter all, what does it matter,\u2014so long as she\r\n\r\n      lives!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe will live!\u201d said Monsieur Darzac, in a voice strangely touching.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd we will find the stolen articles,\u201d said Monsieur Dax. \u201cBut what was\r\n\r\n      in the cabinet?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwenty years of my life,\u201d replied the illustrious professor sadly, \u201cor\r\n\r\n      rather of our lives\u2014the lives of myself and my daughter! Yes, our\r\n\r\n      most precious documents, the records of our secret experiments and our\r\n\r\n      labours of twenty years were in that cabinet. It is an irreparable loss to\r\n\r\n      us and, I venture to say, to science. All the processes by which I had\r\n\r\n      been able to arrive at the precious proof of the destructibility of matter\r\n\r\n      were there\u2014all. The man who came wished to take all from me,\u2014my\r\n\r\n      daughter and my work\u2014my heart and my soul.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And the great scientist wept like a child.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We stood around him in silence, deeply affected by his great distress.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac pressed closely to his side, and tried in vain to restrain\r\n\r\n      his tears\u2014a sight which, for the moment, almost made me like him, in\r\n\r\n      spite of an instinctive repulsion which his strange demeanour and his\r\n\r\n      inexplicable anxiety had inspired me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Rouletabille alone,\u2014as if his precious time and mission on\r\n\r\n      earth did not permit him to dwell in the contemplation on human suffering\u2014had,\r\n\r\n      very calmly, stepped up to the empty cabinet and, pointing at it, broke\r\n\r\n      the almost solemn silence. He entered into explanations, for which there\r\n\r\n      was no need, as to why he had been led to believe that a robbery had been\r\n\r\n      committed, which included the simultaneous discovery he had made in the\r\n\r\n      lavatory, and the empty precious cabinet in the laboratory. The first\r\n\r\n      thing that had struck him, he said, was the unusual form of that piece of\r\n\r\n      furniture. It was very strongly built of fire-proof iron, clearly showing\r\n\r\n      that it was intended for the keeping of most valuable objects. Then he\r\n\r\n      noticed that the key had been left in the lock. \u201cOne does not ordinarily\r\n\r\n      have a safe and leave it open!\u201d he had said to himself. This little key,\r\n\r\n      with its brass head and complicated wards, had strongly attracted him,\u2014its\r\n\r\n      presence had suggested robbery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be greatly perplexed, as if he did not\r\n\r\n      know whether he ought to be glad of the new direction given to the inquiry\r\n\r\n      by the young reporter, or sorry that it had not been done by himself. In\r\n\r\n      our profession and for the general welfare, we have to put up with such\r\n\r\n      mortifications and bury selfish feelings. That was why Monsieur de Marquet\r\n\r\n      controlled himself and joined his compliments with those of Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n      As for Monsieur Rouletabille, he simply shrugged his shoulders and said:\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at all in that!\u201d I should have liked to box his ears,\r\n\r\n      especially when he added: \u201cYou will do well, Monsieur, to ask Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson who usually kept that key?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy daughter,\u201d replied Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cshe was never without it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! then that changes the aspect of things which no longer corresponds\r\n\r\n      with Monsieur Rouletabille\u2019s ideas!\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet. \u201cIf that\r\n\r\n      key never left Mademoiselle Stangerson, the murderer must have waited for\r\n\r\n      her in her room for the purpose of stealing it; and the robbery could not\r\n\r\n      have been committed until after the attack had been made on her. But after\r\n\r\n      the attack four persons were in the laboratory! I can\u2019t make it out!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe robbery,\u201d said the reporter, \u201ccould only have been committed before\r\n\r\n      the attack upon Mademoiselle Stangerson in her room. When the murderer\r\n\r\n      entered the pavilion he already possessed the brass-headed key.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is impossible,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson in a low voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is quite possible, Monsieur, as this proves.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And the young rascal drew a copy of the \u201cEpoque\u201d from his pocket, dated\r\n\r\n      the 21st of October (I recall the fact that the crime was committed on the\r\n\r\n      night between the 24th and 25th), and showing us an advertisement, he\r\n\r\n      read:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Yesterday a black satin reticule was lost in the Grands Magasins de la\r\n\r\n      Louvre. It contained, amongst other things, a small key with a brass head.\r\n\r\n      A handsome reward will be given to the person who has found it. This\r\n\r\n      person must write, poste restante, bureau 40, to this address: M. A. T. H.\r\n\r\n      S. N.\u2019 Do not these letters suggest Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d continued\r\n\r\n      the reporter. \u201cThe \u2018key with a brass head\u2019\u2014is not this the key? I\r\n\r\n      always read advertisements. In my business, as in yours, Monsieur, one\r\n\r\n      should always read the personals.\u2019 They are often the keys to intrigues,\r\n\r\n      that are not always brass-headed, but which are none the less interesting.\r\n\r\n      This advertisement interested me specially; the woman of the key\r\n\r\n      surrounded it with a kind of mystery. Evidently she valued the key, since\r\n\r\n      she promised a big reward for its restoration! And I thought on these six\r\n\r\n      letters: M. A. T. H. S. N. The first four at once pointed to a Christian\r\n\r\n      name; evidently I said Math is Mathilde. But I could make nothing of the\r\n\r\n      two last letters. So I threw the journal aside and occupied myself with\r\n\r\n      other matters. Four days later, when the evening paper appeared with\r\n\r\n      enormous head-lines announcing the murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson, the\r\n\r\n      letters in the advertisement mechanically recurred to me. I had forgotten\r\n\r\n      the two last letters, S. N. When I saw them again I could not help\r\n\r\n      exclaiming, \u2018Stangerson!\u2019 I jumped into a cab and rushed into the bureau\r\n\r\n      No. 40, asking: \u2018Have you a letter addressed to M. A. T. H. S. N.?\u2019 The\r\n\r\n      clerk replied that he had not. I insisted, begged and entreated him to\r\n\r\n      search. He wanted to know if I were playing a joke on him, and then told\r\n\r\n      me that he had had a letter with the initials M. A. T. H. S. N, but he had\r\n\r\n      given it up three days ago, to a lady who came for it. \u2018You come to-day to\r\n\r\n      claim the letter, and the day before yesterday another gentleman claimed\r\n\r\n      it! I\u2019ve had enough of this,\u2019 he concluded angrily. I tried to question\r\n\r\n      him as to the two persons who had already claimed the letter; but whether\r\n\r\n      he wished to entrench himself behind professional secrecy,\u2014he may\r\n\r\n      have thought that he had already said too much,\u2014or whether he was\r\n\r\n      disgusted at the joke that had been played on him\u2014he would not\r\n\r\n      answer any of my questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille paused. We all remained silent. Each drew his own conclusions\r\n\r\n      from the strange story of the poste restante letter. It seemed, indeed,\r\n\r\n      that we now had a thread by means of which we should be able to follow up\r\n\r\n      this extraordinary mystery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen it is almost certain,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cthat my daughter\r\n\r\n      did lose the key, and that she did not tell me of it, wishing to spare any\r\n\r\n      anxiety, and that she begged whoever had found it to write to the poste\r\n\r\n      restante. She evidently feared that, by giving our address, inquiries\r\n\r\n      would have resulted that would have apprised me of the loss of the key. It\r\n\r\n      was quite logical, quite natural for her to have taken that course\u2014for\r\n\r\n      I have been robbed once before.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere was that, and when?\u201d asked the Chief of the Surete.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! many years ago, in America, in Philadelphia. There were stolen from\r\n\r\n      my laboratory the drawings of two inventions that might have made the\r\n\r\n      fortune of a man. Not only have I never learnt who the thief was, but I\r\n\r\n      have never heard even a word of the object of the robbery, doubtless\r\n\r\n      because, in order to defeat the plans of the person who had robbed me, I\r\n\r\n      myself brought these two inventions before the public, and so rendered the\r\n\r\n      robbery of no avail. From that time on I have been very careful to shut\r\n\r\n      myself in when I am at work. The bars to these windows, the lonely\r\n\r\n      situation of this pavilion, this cabinet, which I had specially\r\n\r\n      constructed, this special lock, this unique key, all are precautions\r\n\r\n      against fears inspired by a sad experience.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMost interesting!\u201d remarked Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Rouletabille asked about the reticule. Neither Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson nor Daddy Jacques had seen it for several days, but a few hours\r\n\r\n      later we learned from Mademoiselle Stangerson herself that the reticule\r\n\r\n      had either been stolen from her, or she had lost it. She further\r\n\r\n      corroborated all that had passed just as her father had stated. She had\r\n\r\n      gone to the poste restante and, on the 23rd of October, had received a\r\n\r\n      letter which, she affirmed, contained nothing but a vulgar pleasantry,\r\n\r\n      which she had immediately burned.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      To return to our examination, or rather to our conversation. I must state\r\n\r\n      that the Chief of the Surete having inquired of Monsieur Stangerson under\r\n\r\n      what conditions his daughter had gone to Paris on the 20th of October, we\r\n\r\n      learned that Monsieur Robert Darzac had accompanied her, and Darzac had\r\n\r\n      not been again seen at the chateau from that time to the day after the\r\n\r\n      crime had been committed. The fact that Monsieur Darzac was with her in\r\n\r\n      the Grands Magasins de la Louvre when the reticule disappeared could not\r\n\r\n      pass unnoticed, and, it must be said, strongly awakened our interest.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This conversation between magistrates, accused, victim, witnesses and\r\n\r\n      journalist, was coming to a close when quite a theatrical sensation\u2014an\r\n\r\n      incident of a kind displeasing to Monsieur de Marquet\u2014was produced.\r\n\r\n      The officer of the gendarmes came to announce that Frederic Larsan\r\n\r\n      requested to be admitted,\u2014a request that was at once complied with.\r\n\r\n      He held in his hand a heavy pair of muddy boots, which he threw on the\r\n\r\n      pavement of the laboratory.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201care the boots worn by the murderer. Do you recognise\r\n\r\n      them, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques bent over them and, stupefied, recognised a pair of old\r\n\r\n      boots which he had, some time back, thrown into a corner of his attic. He\r\n\r\n      was so taken aback that he could not hide his agitation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then pointing to the handkerchief in the old man\u2019s hand, Frederic Larsan\r\n\r\n      said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a handkerchief astonishingly like the one found in The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, trembling, \u201cthey are almost alike.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then,\u201d continued Frederic Larsan, \u201cthe old Basque cap also found in\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d might at one time have been worn by Daddy Jacques himself.\r\n\r\n      All this, gentlemen, proves, I think, that the murderer wished to disguise\r\n\r\n      his real personality. He did it in a very clumsy way\u2014or, at least,\r\n\r\n      so it appears to us. Don\u2019t be alarmed, Daddy Jacques; we are quite sure\r\n\r\n      that you were not the murderer; you never left the side of Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. But if Monsieur Stangerson had not been working that night and\r\n\r\n      had gone back to the chateau after parting with his daughter, and Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques had gone to sleep in his attic, no one would have doubted that he\r\n\r\n      was the murderer. He owes his safety, therefore, to the tragedy having\r\n\r\n      been enacted too soon,\u2014the murderer, no doubt, from the silence in\r\n\r\n      the laboratory, imagined that it was empty, and that the moment for action\r\n\r\n      had come. The man who had been able to introduce himself here so\r\n\r\n      mysteriously and to leave so many evidences against Daddy Jacques, was,\r\n\r\n      there can be no doubt, familiar with the house. At what hour exactly he\r\n\r\n      entered, whether in the afternoon or in the evening, I cannot say. One\r\n\r\n      familiar with the proceedings and persons of this pavilion could choose\r\n\r\n      his own time for entering \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe could not have entered it if anybody had been in the laboratory,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do we know that?\u201d replied Larsan. \u201cThere was the dinner in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory, the coming and going of the servants in attendance. There was\r\n\r\n      a chemical experiment being carried on between ten and eleven o\u2019clock,\r\n\r\n      with Monsieur Stangerson, his daughter, and Daddy Jacques engaged at the\r\n\r\n      furnace in a corner of the high chimney. Who can say that the murderer\u2014an\r\n\r\n      intimate!\u2014a friend!\u2014did not take advantage of that moment to\r\n\r\n      slip into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, after having taken off his boots in the\r\n\r\n      lavatory?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is very improbable,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoubtless\u2014but it is not impossible. I assert nothing. As to the\r\n\r\n      escape from the pavilion\u2014that\u2019s another thing, the most natural\r\n\r\n      thing in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      For a moment Frederic Larsan paused,\u2014a moment that appeared to us a\r\n\r\n      very long time. The eagerness with which we awaited what he was going to\r\n\r\n      tell us may be imagined.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have not been in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I take it for\r\n\r\n      granted that you have satisfied yourselves that he could have left the\r\n\r\n      room only by way of the door; it is by the door, then, that the murderer\r\n\r\n      made his way out. At what time? At the moment when it was most easy for\r\n\r\n      him to do so; at the moment when it became most explainable\u2014so\r\n\r\n      completely explainable that there can be no other explanation. Let us go\r\n\r\n      over the moments which followed after the crime had been committed. There\r\n\r\n      was the first moment, when Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques were\r\n\r\n      close to the door, ready to bar the way. There was the second moment,\r\n\r\n      during which Daddy Jacques was absent and Monsieur Stangerson was left\r\n\r\n      alone before the door. There was a third moment, when Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n      was joined by the concierge. There was a fourth moment, during which\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson, the concierge and his wife and Daddy Jacques were\r\n\r\n      before the door. There was a fifth moment, during which the door was burst\r\n\r\n      open and \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d entered. The moment at which the flight is\r\n\r\n      explainable is the very moment when there was the least number of persons\r\n\r\n      before the door. There was one moment when there was but one person,\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. Unless a complicity of silence on the part of Daddy Jacques is\r\n\r\n      admitted\u2014in which I do not believe\u2014the door was opened in the\r\n\r\n      presence of Monsieur Stangerson alone and the man escaped.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere we must admit that Monsieur Stangerson had powerful reasons for not\r\n\r\n      arresting, or not causing the arrest of the murderer, since he allowed him\r\n\r\n      to reach the window in the vestibule and closed it after him!\u2014That\r\n\r\n      done, Mademoiselle Stangerson, though horribly wounded, had still strength\r\n\r\n      enough, and no doubt in obedience to the entreaties of her father, to\r\n\r\n      refasten the door of her chamber, with both the bolt and the lock, before\r\n\r\n      sinking on the floor. We do not know who committed the crime; we do not\r\n\r\n      know of what wretch Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson are the victims,\r\n\r\n      but there is no doubt that they both know! The secret must be a terrible\r\n\r\n      one, for the father had not hesitated to leave his daughter to die behind\r\n\r\n      a door which she had shut upon herself,\u2014terrible for him to have\r\n\r\n      allowed the assassin to escape. For there is no other way in the world to\r\n\r\n      explain the murderer\u2019s flight from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The silence which followed this dramatic and lucid explanation was\r\n\r\n      appalling. We all of us felt grieved for the illustrious professor, driven\r\n\r\n      into a corner by the pitiless logic of Frederic Larsan, forced to confess\r\n\r\n      the whole truth of his martyrdom or to keep silent, and thus make a yet\r\n\r\n      more terrible admission. The man himself, a veritable statue of sorrow,\r\n\r\n      raised his hand with a gesture so solemn that we bowed our heads to it as\r\n\r\n      before something sacred. He then pronounced these words, in a voice so\r\n\r\n      loud that it seemed to exhaust him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI swear by the head of my suffering child that I never for an instant\r\n\r\n      left the door of her chamber after hearing her cries for help; that that\r\n\r\n      door was not opened while I was alone in the laboratory; and that,\r\n\r\n      finally, when we entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, my three domestics and I, the\r\n\r\n      murderer was no longer there! I swear I do not know the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Must I say it,\u2014in spite of the solemnity of Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s\r\n\r\n      words, we did not believe in his denial. Frederic Larsan had shown us the\r\n\r\n      truth and it was not so easily given up.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet announced that the conversation was at an end, and as\r\n\r\n      we were about to leave the laboratory, Joseph Rouletabille approached\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson, took him by the hand with the greatest respect, and I\r\n\r\n      heard him say:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe you, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I here close the citation which I have thought it my duty to make from\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Maleine\u2019s narrative. I need not tell the reader that all that\r\n\r\n      passed in the laboratory was immediately and faithfully reported to me by\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XII. Frederic Larsan\u2019s Cane\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was not till six o\u2019clock that I left the chateau, taking with me the\r\n\r\n      article hastily written by my friend in the little sitting-room which\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac had placed at our disposal. The reporter was to\r\n\r\n      sleep at the chateau, taking advantage of the to me inexplicable\r\n\r\n      hospitality offered him by Monsieur Robert Darzac, to whom Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, in that sad time, left the care of all his domestic affairs.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless he insisted on accompanying me to the station at Epinay. In\r\n\r\n      crossing the park, he said to me:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic is really very clever and has not belied his reputation. Do you\r\n\r\n      know how he came to find Daddy Jacques\u2019s boots?\u2014Near the spot where\r\n\r\n      we noticed the traces of the neat boots and the disappearance of the rough\r\n\r\n      ones, there was a square hole, freshly made in the moist ground, where a\r\n\r\n      stone had evidently been removed. Larsan searched for that stone without\r\n\r\n      finding it, and at once imagined that it had been used by the murderer\r\n\r\n      with which to sink the boots in the lake. Fred\u2019s calculation was an\r\n\r\n      excellent one, as the success of his search proves. That escaped me; but\r\n\r\n      my mind was turned in another direction by the large number of false\r\n\r\n      indications of his track which the murderer left, and by the measure of\r\n\r\n      the black foot-marks corresponding with that of Daddy Jacques\u2019s boots,\r\n\r\n      which I had established without his suspecting it, on the floor of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room. All which was a proof, in my eyes, that the murderer had\r\n\r\n      sought to turn suspicion on to the old servant. Up to that point, Larsan\r\n\r\n      and I are in accord; but no further. It is going to be a terrible matter;\r\n\r\n      for I tell you he is working on wrong lines, and I\u2014I, must fight him\r\n\r\n      with nothing!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was surprised at the profoundly grave accent with which my young friend\r\n\r\n      pronounced the last words.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He repeated:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes\u2014terrible!\u2014terrible! For it is fighting with nothing, when you\r\n\r\n      have only an idea to fight with.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment we passed by the back of the chateau. Night had come. A\r\n\r\n      window on the first floor was partly open. A feeble light came from it as\r\n\r\n      well as some sounds which drew our attention. We approached until we had\r\n\r\n      reached the side of a door that was situated just under the window.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, in a low tone, made me understand, that this was the window\r\n\r\n      of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber. The sounds which had attracted our\r\n\r\n      attention ceased, then were renewed for a moment, and then we heard\r\n\r\n      stifled sobs. We were only able to catch these words, which reached us\r\n\r\n      distinctly: \u201cMy poor Robert!\u201d\u2014Rouletabille whispered in my ear:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we only knew what was being said in that chamber, my inquiry would\r\n\r\n      soon be finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He looked about him. The darkness of the evening enveloped us; we could\r\n\r\n      not see much beyond the narrow path bordered by trees, which ran behind\r\n\r\n      the chateau. The sobs had ceased.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we can\u2019t hear we may at least try to see,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And, making a sign to me to deaden the sound of my steps, he led me across\r\n\r\n      the path to the trunk of a tall beech tree, the white bole of which was\r\n\r\n      visible in the darkness. This tree grew exactly in front of the window in\r\n\r\n      which we were so much interested, its lower branches being on a level with\r\n\r\n      the first floor of the chateau. From the height of those branches one\r\n\r\n      might certainly see what was passing in Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber.\r\n\r\n      Evidently that was what Rouletabille thought, for, enjoining me to remain\r\n\r\n      hidden, he clasped the trunk with his vigorous arms and climbed up. I soon\r\n\r\n      lost sight of him amid the branches, and then followed a deep silence. In\r\n\r\n      front of me, the open window remained lighted, and I saw no shadow move\r\n\r\n      across it. I listened, and presently from above me these words reached my\r\n\r\n      ears:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter you, pray!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Somebody was overhead, speaking,\u2014exchanging courtesies. What was my\r\n\r\n      astonishment to see on the slippery column of the tree two human forms\r\n\r\n      appear and quietly slip down to the ground. Rouletabille had mounted\r\n\r\n      alone, and had returned with another.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood evening, Monsieur Sainclair!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was Frederic Larsan. The detective had already occupied the post of\r\n\r\n      observation when my young friend had thought to reach it alone. Neither\r\n\r\n      noticed my astonishment. I explained that to myself by the fact that they\r\n\r\n      must have been witnesses of some tender and despairing scene between\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, lying in her bed, and Monsieur Darzac on his\r\n\r\n      knees by her pillow. I guessed that each had drawn different conclusions\r\n\r\n      from what they had seen. It was easy to see that the scene had strongly\r\n\r\n      impressed Rouletabille in favour of Monsieur Robert Darzac; while, to\r\n\r\n      Larsan, it showed nothing but consummate hypocrisy, acted with finished\r\n\r\n      art by Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As we reached the park gate, Larsan stopped us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy cane!\u201d he cried. \u201cI left it near the tree.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He left us, saying he would rejoin us presently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you noticed Frederic Larsan\u2019s cane?\u201d asked the young reporter, as\r\n\r\n      soon as we were alone. \u201cIt is quite a new one, which I have never seen him\r\n\r\n      use before. He seems to take great care of it\u2014it never leaves him.\r\n\r\n      One would think he was afraid it might fall into the hands of strangers. I\r\n\r\n      never saw it before to-day. Where did he find it? It isn\u2019t natural that a\r\n\r\n      man who had never before used a walking-stick should, the day after the\r\n\r\n      Glandier crime, never move a step without one. On the day of our arrival\r\n\r\n      at the chateau, as soon as he saw us, he put his watch in his pocket and\r\n\r\n      picked up his cane from the ground\u2014a proceeding to which I was\r\n\r\n      perhaps wrong not to attach some importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were now out of the park. Rouletabille had dropped into silence. His\r\n\r\n      thoughts were certainly still occupied with Frederic Larsan\u2019s new cane. I\r\n\r\n      had proof of that when, as we came near to Epinay, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic Larsan arrived at the Glandier before me; he began his inquiry\r\n\r\n      before me; he has had time to find out things about which I know nothing.\r\n\r\n      Where did he find that cane?\u201d Then he added: \u201cIt is probable that his\r\n\r\n      suspicion\u2014more than that, his reasoning\u2014has led him to lay his\r\n\r\n      hand on something tangible. Has this cane anything to do with it? Where\r\n\r\n      the deuce could he have found it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As I had to wait twenty minutes for the train at Epinay, we entered a wine\r\n\r\n      shop. Almost immediately the door opened and Frederic Larsan made his\r\n\r\n      appearance, brandishing his famous cane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI found it!\u201d he said laughingly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The three of us seated ourselves at a table. Rouletabille never took his\r\n\r\n      eyes off the cane; he was so absorbed that he did not notice a sign Larsan\r\n\r\n      made to a railway employee, a young man with a chin decorated by a tiny\r\n\r\n      blond and ill-kept beard. On the sign he rose, paid for his drink, bowed,\r\n\r\n      and went out. I should not myself have attached any importance to the\r\n\r\n      circumstance, if it had not been recalled to my mind, some months later,\r\n\r\n      by the reappearance of the man with the beard at one of the most tragic\r\n\r\n      moments of this case. I then learned that the youth was one of Larsan\u2019s\r\n\r\n      assistants and had been charged by him to watch the going and coming of\r\n\r\n      travellers at the station of Epinay-sur-Orge. Larsan neglected nothing in\r\n\r\n      any case on which he was engaged.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I turned my eyes again on Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u2014Monsieur Fred!\u201d he said, \u201cwhen did you begin to use a\r\n\r\n      walking-stick? I have always seen you walking with your hands in your\r\n\r\n      pockets!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a present,\u201d replied the detective.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRecent?\u201d insisted Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, it was given to me in London.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, yes, I remember\u2014you have just come from London. May I look at\r\n\r\n      it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh!\u2014certainly!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Fred passed the cane to Rouletabille. It was a large yellow bamboo with a\r\n\r\n      crutch handle and ornamented with a gold ring. Rouletabille, after\r\n\r\n      examining it minutely, returned it to Larsan, with a bantering expression\r\n\r\n      on his face, saying:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou were given a French cane in London!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPossibly,\u201d said Fred, imperturbably.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRead the mark there, in tiny letters: Cassette, 6a, Opera.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCannot English people buy canes in Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      When Rouletabille had seen me into the train, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll remember the address?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u2014Cassette, 6a, Opera. Rely on me; you shall have word tomorrow\r\n\r\n      morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That evening, on reaching Paris, I saw Monsieur Cassette, dealer in\r\n\r\n      walking-sticks and umbrellas, and wrote to my friend:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA man unmistakably answering to the description of Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2014same\r\n\r\n      height, slightly stooping, putty-coloured overcoat, bowler hat\u2014purchased\r\n\r\n      a cane similar to the one in which we are interested, on the evening of\r\n\r\n      the crime, about eight o\u2019clock. Monsieur Cassette had not sold another\r\n\r\n      such cane during the last two years. Fred\u2019s cane is new. It is quite clear\r\n\r\n      that it\u2019s the same cane. Fred did not buy it, since he was in London. Like\r\n\r\n      you, I think that he found it somewhere near Monsieur Robert Darzac. But\r\n\r\n      if, as you suppose, the murderer was in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d for five, or even\r\n\r\n      six hours, and the crime was not committed until towards midnight, the\r\n\r\n      purchase of this cane proves an incontestable alibi for Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XIII. \u201cThe Presbytery Has Lost Nothing of Its Charm, Nor the\r\n\r\n      Garden Its Brightness\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A week after the occurrence of the events I have just recounted\u2014on\r\n\r\n      the 2nd of November, to be exact\u2014I received at my home in Paris the\r\n\r\n      following telegraphic message: \u201cCome to the Glandier by the earliest\r\n\r\n      train. Bring revolvers. Friendly greetings. Rouletabille.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I have already said, I think, that at that period, being a young barrister\r\n\r\n      with but few briefs, I frequented the Palais de Justice rather for the\r\n\r\n      purpose of familiarising myself with my professional duties than for the\r\n\r\n      defence of the widow and orphan. I could, therefore, feel no surprise at\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille disposing of my time. Moreover, he knew how keenly interested\r\n\r\n      I was in his journalistic adventures in general and, above all, in the\r\n\r\n      murder at the Glandier. I had not heard from him for a week, nor of the\r\n\r\n      progress made with that mysterious case, except by the innumerable\r\n\r\n      paragraphs in the newspapers and by the very brief notes of Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      in the \u201cEpoque.\u201d Those notes had divulged the fact that traces of human\r\n\r\n      blood had been found on the mutton-bone, as well as fresh traces of the\r\n\r\n      blood of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014the old stains belonged to other\r\n\r\n      crimes, probably dating years back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It may be easily imagined that the crime engaged the attention of the\r\n\r\n      press throughout the world. No crime known had more absorbed the minds of\r\n\r\n      people. It appeared to me, however, that the judicial inquiry was making\r\n\r\n      but very little progress; and I should have been very glad, if, on the\r\n\r\n      receipt of my friend\u2019s invitation to rejoin him at the Glandier, the\r\n\r\n      despatch had not contained the words, \u201cBring revolvers.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That puzzled me greatly. Rouletabille telegraphing for revolvers meant\r\n\r\n      that there might be occasion to use them. Now, I confess it without shame,\r\n\r\n      I am not a hero. But here was a friend, evidently in danger, calling on me\r\n\r\n      to go to his aid. I did not hesitate long; and after assuring myself that\r\n\r\n      the only revolver I possessed was properly loaded, I hurried towards the\r\n\r\n      Orleans station. On the way I remembered that Rouletabille had asked for\r\n\r\n      two revolvers; I therefore entered a gunsmith\u2019s shop and bought an\r\n\r\n      excellent weapon for my friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I had hoped to find him at the station at Epinay; but he was not there.\r\n\r\n      However, a cab was waiting for me and I was soon at the Glandier. Nobody\r\n\r\n      was at the gate, and it was only on the threshold of the chateau that I\r\n\r\n      met the young man. He saluted me with a friendly gesture and threw his\r\n\r\n      arms about me, inquiring warmly as to the state of my health.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When we were in the little sitting-room of which I have spoken,\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille made me sit down.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s going badly,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat\u2019s going badly?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He came nearer to me and whispered:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic Larsan is working with might and main against Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      This did not astonish me. I had seen the poor show Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s fiance had made at the time of the examination of the\r\n\r\n      footprints. However, I immediately asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat about that cane?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is still in the hands of Frederic Larsan. He never lets go of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut doesn\u2019t it prove the alibi for Monsieur Darzac?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot at all. Gently questioned by me, Darzac denied having, on that\r\n\r\n      evening, or on any other, purchased a cane at Cassette\u2019s. However,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, \u201cI\u2019ll not swear to anything; Monsieur Darzac has such\r\n\r\n      strange fits of silence that one does not know exactly what to think of\r\n\r\n      what he says.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo Frederic Larsan this cane must mean a piece of very damaging evidence.\r\n\r\n      But in what way? The time when it was bought shows it could not have been\r\n\r\n      in the murderer\u2019s possession.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe time doesn\u2019t worry Larsan. He is not obliged to adopt my theory which\r\n\r\n      assumes that the murderer got into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d between five and six\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock. But there\u2019s nothing to prevent him assuming that the murderer got\r\n\r\n      in between ten and eleven o\u2019clock at night. At that hour Monsieur and\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, assisted by Daddy Jacques, were engaged in making\r\n\r\n      an interesting chemical experiment in the part of the laboratory taken up\r\n\r\n      by the furnaces. Larsan says, unlikely as that may seem, that the murderer\r\n\r\n      may have slipped behind them. He has already got the examining magistrate\r\n\r\n      to listen to him. When one looks closely into it, the reasoning is absurd,\r\n\r\n      seeing that the \u2018intimate\u2019\u2014if there is one\u2014must have known\r\n\r\n      that the professor would shortly leave the pavilion, and that the \u2018friend\u2019\r\n\r\n      had only to put off operating till after the professor\u2019s departure. Why\r\n\r\n      should he have risked crossing the laboratory while the professor was in\r\n\r\n      it? And then, when he had got into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are many points to be cleared up before Larsan\u2019s theory can be\r\n\r\n      admitted. I sha\u2019n\u2019t waste my time over it, for my theory won\u2019t allow me to\r\n\r\n      occupy myself with mere imagination. Only, as I am obliged for the moment\r\n\r\n      to keep silent, and Larsan sometimes talks, he may finish by coming out\r\n\r\n      openly against Monsieur Darzac,\u2014if I\u2019m not there,\u201d added the young\r\n\r\n      reporter proudly. \u201cFor there are surface evidences against Darzac, much\r\n\r\n      more convincing than that cane, which remains incomprehensible to me, all\r\n\r\n      the more so as Larsan does not in the least hesitate to let Darzac see him\r\n\r\n      with it!\u2014I understand many things in Larsan\u2019s theory, but I can\u2019t\r\n\r\n      make anything of that cane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs he still at the chateau?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; he hardly ever leaves it!\u2014He sleeps there, as I do, at the\r\n\r\n      request of Monsieur Stangerson, who has done for him what Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac has done for me. In spite of the accusation made by Larsan that\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson knows who the murderer is he yet affords him every\r\n\r\n      facility for arriving at the truth,\u2014just as Darzac is doing for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut you are convinced of Darzac\u2019s innocence?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt one time I did believe in the possibility of his guilt. That was when\r\n\r\n      we arrived here for the first time. The time has come for me to tell you\r\n\r\n      what has passed between Monsieur Darzac and myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here Rouletabille interrupted himself and asked me if I had brought the\r\n\r\n      revolvers. I showed him them. Having examined both, he pronounced them\r\n\r\n      excellent, and handed them back to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShall we have any use for them?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt; this evening. We shall pass the night here\u2014if that won\u2019t\r\n\r\n      tire you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d I said with an expression that made Rouletabille laugh.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is no time for laughing. You remember the phrase\r\n\r\n      which was the \u2018open sesame\u2019 of this chateau full of mystery?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cperfectly,\u2014\u2018The presbytery has lost nothing of its\r\n\r\n      charm, nor the garden its brightness.\u2019 It was the phrase which you found\r\n\r\n      on the half-burned piece of paper amongst the ashes in the laboratory.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; at the bottom of the paper, where the flame had not reached, was\r\n\r\n      this date: 23rd of October. Remember this date, it is highly important. I\r\n\r\n      am now going to tell you about that curious phrase. On the evening before\r\n\r\n      the crime, that is to say, on the 23rd, Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson were at a reception at the Elysee. I know that, because I was\r\n\r\n      there on duty, having to interview one of the savants of the Academy of\r\n\r\n      Philadelphia, who was being feted there. I had never before seen either\r\n\r\n      Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson. I was seated in the room which\r\n\r\n      precedes the Salon des Ambassadeurs, and, tired of being jostled by so\r\n\r\n      many noble personages, I had fallen into a vague reverie, when I scented\r\n\r\n      near me the perfume of the lady in black.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you ask me what is the \u2018perfume of the lady in black\u2019? It must suffice\r\n\r\n      for you to know that it is a perfume of which I am very fond, because it\r\n\r\n      was that of a lady who had been very kind to me in my childhood,\u2014a\r\n\r\n      lady whom I had always seen dressed in black. The lady who, that evening,\r\n\r\n      was scented with the perfume of the lady in black, was dressed in white.\r\n\r\n      She was wonderfully beautiful. I could not help rising and following her.\r\n\r\n      An old man gave her his arm and, as they passed, I heard voices say:\r\n\r\n      \u2018Professor Stangerson and his daughter.\u2019 It was in that way I learned who\r\n\r\n      it was I was following.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey met Monsieur Robert Darzac, whom I knew by sight. Professor\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, accosted by Mr. Arthur William Rance, one of the American\r\n\r\n      savants, seated himself in the great gallery, and Monsieur Robert Darzac\r\n\r\n      led Mademoiselle Stangerson into the conservatory. I followed. The weather\r\n\r\n      was very mild that evening; the garden doors were open. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson threw a fichu shawl over her shoulders and I plainly saw that\r\n\r\n      it was she who was begging Monsieur Darzac to go with her into the garden.\r\n\r\n      I continued to follow, interested by the agitation plainly exhibited by\r\n\r\n      the bearing of Monsieur Darzac. They slowly passed along the wall abutting\r\n\r\n      on the Avenue Marigny. I took the central alley, walking parallel with\r\n\r\n      them, and then crossed over for the purpose of getting nearer to them. The\r\n\r\n      night was dark, and the grass deadened the sound of my steps. They had\r\n\r\n      stopped under the vacillating light of a gas jet and appeared to be both\r\n\r\n      bending over a paper held by Mademoiselle Stangerson, reading something\r\n\r\n      which deeply interested them. I stopped in the darkness and silence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNeither of them saw me, and I distinctly heard Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      repeat, as she was refolding the paper: \u2018The presbytery has lost nothing\r\n\r\n      of its charm, nor the garden its brightness!\u2019\u2014It was said in a tone\r\n\r\n      at once mocking and despairing, and was followed by a burst of such\r\n\r\n      nervous laughter that I think her words will never cease to sound in my\r\n\r\n      ears. But another phrase was uttered by Monsieur Robert Darzac: \u2018Must I\r\n\r\n      commit a crime, then, to win you?\u2019 He was in an extraordinarily agitated\r\n\r\n      state. He took the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson and held it for a long\r\n\r\n      time to his lips, and I thought, from the movement of his shoulders, that\r\n\r\n      he was crying. Then they went away.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I returned to the great gallery,\u201d continued Rouletabille, \u201cI saw no\r\n\r\n      more of Monsieur Robert Darzac, and I was not to see him again until after\r\n\r\n      the tragedy at the Glandier. Mademoiselle was near Mr. Rance, who was\r\n\r\n      talking with much animation, his eyes, during the conversation, glowing\r\n\r\n      with a singular brightness. Mademoiselle Stangerson, I thought, was not\r\n\r\n      even listening to what he was saying, her face expressing perfect\r\n\r\n      indifference. His face was the red face of a drunkard. When Monsieur and\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson left, he went to the bar and remained there. I\r\n\r\n      joined him, and rendered him some little service in the midst of the\r\n\r\n      pressing crowd. He thanked me and told me he was returning to America\r\n\r\n      three days later, that is to say, on the 26th (the day after the crime). I\r\n\r\n      talked with him about Philadelphia; he told me he had lived there for\r\n\r\n      five-and-twenty years, and that it was there he had met the illustrious\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson and his daughter. He drank a great deal of champagne,\r\n\r\n      and when I left him he was very nearly drunk.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSuch were my experiences on that evening, and I leave you to imagine what\r\n\r\n      effect the news of the attempted murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      produced on me,\u2014with what force those words pronounced by Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac, \u2018Must I commit a crime, then, to win you?\u2019 recurred to me.\r\n\r\n      It was not this phrase, however, that I repeated to him, when we met here\r\n\r\n      at Glandier. The sentence of the presbytery and the bright garden sufficed\r\n\r\n      to open the gate of the chateau. If you ask me if I believe now that\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac is the murderer, I must say I do not. I do not think I\r\n\r\n      ever quite thought that. At the time I could not really think seriously of\r\n\r\n      anything. I had so little evidence to go on. But I needed to have at once\r\n\r\n      the proof that he had not been wounded in the hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen we were alone together, I told him how I had chanced to overhear a\r\n\r\n      part of his conversation with Mademoiselle Stangerson in the garden of the\r\n\r\n      Elysee; and when I repeated to him the words, \u2018Must I commit a crime,\r\n\r\n      then, to win you?\u2019 he was greatly troubled, though much less so than he\r\n\r\n      had been by hearing me repeat the phrase about the presbytery. What threw\r\n\r\n      him into a state of real consternation was to learn from me that the day\r\n\r\n      on which he had gone to meet Mademoiselle Stangerson at the Elysee, was\r\n\r\n      the very day on which she had gone to the Post Office for the letter. It\r\n\r\n      was that letter, perhaps, which ended with the words: \u2018The presbytery has\r\n\r\n      lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.\u2019 My surmise was\r\n\r\n      confirmed by my finding, if you remember, in the ashes of the laboratory,\r\n\r\n      the fragment of paper dated October the 23rd. The letter had been written\r\n\r\n      and withdrawn from the Post Office on the same day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere can be no doubt that, on returning from the Elysee that night,\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had tried to destroy that compromising paper. It\r\n\r\n      was in vain that Monsieur Darzac denied that that letter had anything\r\n\r\n      whatever to do with the crime. I told him that in an affair so filled with\r\n\r\n      mystery as this, he had no right to hide this letter; that I was persuaded\r\n\r\n      it was of considerable importance; that the desperate tone in which\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had pronounced the prophetic phrase,\u2014that\r\n\r\n      his own tears, and the threat of a crime which he had professed after the\r\n\r\n      letter was read\u2014all these facts tended to leave no room for me to\r\n\r\n      doubt. Monsieur Darzac became more and more agitated, and I determined to\r\n\r\n      take advantage of the effect I had produced on him. \u2018You were on the point\r\n\r\n      of being married, Monsieur,\u2019 I said negligently and without looking at\r\n\r\n      him, \u2018and suddenly your marriage becomes impossible because of the writer\r\n\r\n      of that letter; because as soon as his letter was read, you spoke of the\r\n\r\n      necessity for a crime to win Mademoiselle Stangerson. Therefore there is someone between you and her\u2014someone who is preventing your marriage with\r\n\r\nher\u2014someone who has attempted to kill her, so that she should not be able to marry!\u2019 And I concluded with these words: \u2018Now,\r\n\r\n      monsieur, you have only to tell me in confidence the name of the\r\n\r\n      murderer!\u2019\u2014The words I had uttered must have struck him ominously,\r\n\r\n      for when I turned my eyes on him, I saw that his face was haggard, the\r\n\r\n      perspiration standing on his forehead, and terror showing in his eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Monsieur,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I am going to ask of you something which may\r\n\r\n      appear insane, but in exchange for which I place my life in your hands.\r\n\r\n      You must not tell the magistrates of what you saw and heard in the garden\r\n\r\n      of the Elysee,\u2014neither to them nor to anybody. I swear to you, that\r\n\r\n      I am innocent, and I know, I feel, that you believe me; but I would rather\r\n\r\n      be taken for the guilty man than see justice go astray on that phrase,\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its\r\n\r\n      brightness.\u201d The judges must know nothing about that phrase. All this\r\n\r\n      matter is in your hands. Monsieur, I leave it there; but forget the\r\n\r\n      evening at the Elysee. A hundred other roads are open to you in your\r\n\r\n      search for the criminal. I will open them for you myself. I will help you.\r\n\r\n      Will you take up your quarters here?\u2014You may remain here to do as\r\n\r\n      you please.\u2014Eat\u2014sleep here\u2014watch my actions\u2014the\r\n\r\n      actions of all here. You shall be master of the Glandier, Monsieur; but\r\n\r\n      forget the evening at the Elysee.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille here paused to take breath. I now understood what had\r\n\r\n      appeared so unexplainable in the demeanour of Monsieur Robert Darzac\r\n\r\n      towards my friend, and the facility with which the young reporter had been\r\n\r\n      able to install himself on the scene of the crime. My curiosity could not\r\n\r\n      fail to be excited by all I had heard. I asked Rouletabille to satisfy it\r\n\r\n      still further. What had happened at the Glandier during the past week?\u2014Had\r\n\r\n      he not told me that there were surface indications against Monsieur Darzac\r\n\r\n      much more terrible than that of the cane found by Larsan?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything seems to be pointing against him,\u201d replied my friend, \u201cand the\r\n\r\n      situation is becoming exceedingly grave. Monsieur Darzac appears not to\r\n\r\n      mind it much; but in that he is wrong. I was interested only in the health\r\n\r\n      of Mademoiselle Stangerson, which was daily improving, when something\r\n\r\n      occurred that is even more mysterious than\u2014than the mystery of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cImpossible!\u201d I cried, \u201cWhat could be more mysterious than that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet us first go back to Monsieur Robert Darzac,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      calming me. \u201cI have said that everything seems to be pointing against him.\r\n\r\n      The marks of the neat boots found by Frederic Larsan appear to be really\r\n\r\n      the footprints of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance. The marks made by the\r\n\r\n      bicycle may have been made by his bicycle. He had usually left it at the\r\n\r\n      chateau; why did he take it to Paris on that particular occasion? Was it\r\n\r\n      because he was not going to return again to the chateau? Was it because,\r\n\r\n      owing to the breaking off of his marriage, his relations with the\r\n\r\n      Stangersons were to cease? All who are interested in the matter affirm\r\n\r\n      that those relations were to continue unchanged.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic Larsan, however, believes that all relations were at an end.\r\n\r\n      From the day when Monsieur Darzac accompanied Mademoiselle Stangerson to\r\n\r\n      the Grands Magasins de la Louvre until the day after the crime, he had not\r\n\r\n      been at the Glandier. Remember that Mademoiselle Stangerson lost her\r\n\r\n      reticule containing the key with the brass head while she was in his\r\n\r\n      company. From that day to the evening at the Elysee, the Sorbonne\r\n\r\n      professor and Mademoiselle Stangerson did not see one another; but they\r\n\r\n      may have written to each other. Mademoiselle Stangerson went to the Post\r\n\r\n      Office to get a letter, which Larsan says was written by Robert Darzac;\r\n\r\n      for knowing nothing of what had passed at the Elysee, Larsan believes that\r\n\r\n      it was Monsieur Darzac himself who stole the reticule with the key, with\r\n\r\n      the design of forcing her consent, by getting possession of the precious\r\n\r\n      papers of her father\u2014papers which he would have restored to him on\r\n\r\n      condition that the marriage engagement was to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll that would have been a very doubtful and almost absurd hypothesis, as\r\n\r\n      Larsan admitted to me, but for another and much graver circumstance. In\r\n\r\n      the first place here is something which I have not been able to explain\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Darzac had himself, on the 24th, gone to the Post Office to ask for the\r\n\r\n      letter which Mademoiselle had called for and received on the previous\r\n\r\n      evening. The description of the man who made application tallies in every\r\n\r\n      respect with the appearance of Monsieur Darzac, who, in answer to the\r\n\r\n      questions put to him by the examining magistrate, denies that he went to\r\n\r\n      the Post Office. Now even admitting that the letter was written by him\u2014which\r\n\r\n      I do not believe\u2014he knew that Mademoiselle Stangerson had received\r\n\r\n      it, since he had seen it in her hands in the garden at the Elysee. It\r\n\r\n      could not have been he, then, who had gone to the Post Office, the day\r\n\r\n      after the 24th, to ask for a letter which he knew was no longer there.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo me it appears clear that somebody, strongly resembling him, stole\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s reticule and in that letter, had demanded of her\r\n\r\n      something which she had not sent him. He must have been surprised at the\r\n\r\n      failure of his demand, hence his application at the Post Office, to learn\r\n\r\n      whether his letter had been delivered to the person to whom it had been\r\n\r\n      addressed. Finding that it had been claimed, he had become furious. What\r\n\r\n      had he demanded? Nobody but Mademoiselle Stangerson knows. Then, on the\r\n\r\n      day following, it is reported that she had been attacked during the night,\r\n\r\n      and, the next day, I discovered that the Professor had, at the same time,\r\n\r\n      been robbed by means of the key referred to in the poste restante letter.\r\n\r\n      It would seem, then, that the man who went to the Post Office to inquire\r\n\r\n      for the letter must have been the murderer. All these arguments Larsan\r\n\r\n      applies as against Monsieur Darzac. You may be sure that the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate, Larsan, and myself, have done our best to get from the Post\r\n\r\n      Office precise details relative to the singular personage who applied\r\n\r\n      there on the 24th of October. But nothing has been learned. We don\u2019t know\r\n\r\n      where he came from\u2014or where he went. Beyond the description which\r\n\r\n      makes him resemble Monsieur Darzac, we know nothing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have announced in the leading journals that a handsome reward will be\r\n\r\n      given to a driver of any public conveyance who drove a fare to No. 40,\r\n\r\n      Post Office, about ten o\u2019clock on the morning of the 24th of October.\r\n\r\n      Information to be addressed to \u2018M. R.,\u2019 at the office of the \u2018Epoque\u2019; but\r\n\r\n      no answer has resulted. The man may have walked; but, as he was most\r\n\r\n      likely in a hurry, there was a chance that he might have gone in a cab.\r\n\r\n      Who, I keep asking myself night and day, is the man who so strongly\r\n\r\n      resembles Monsieur Robert Darzac, and who is also known to have bought the\r\n\r\n      cane which has fallen into Larsan\u2019s hands?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe most serious fact is that Monsieur Darzac was, at the very same time\r\n\r\n      that his double presented himself at the Post Office, scheduled for a\r\n\r\n      lecture at the Sorbonne. He had not delivered that lecture, and one of his\r\n\r\n      friends took his place. When I questioned him as to how he had employeed\r\n\r\n      the time, he told me that he had gone for a stroll in the Bois de\r\n\r\n      Boulogne. What do you think of a professor who, instead of giving his\r\n\r\n      lecture, obtains a substitute to go for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne?\r\n\r\n      When Frederic Larsan asked him for information on this point, he quietly\r\n\r\n      replied that it was no business of his how he spent his time in Paris. On\r\n\r\n      which Fred swore aloud that he would find out, without anybody\u2019s help.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll this seems to fit in with Fred\u2019s hypothesis, namely, that Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson allowed the murderer to escape in order to avoid a scandal. The\r\n\r\n      hypothesis is further substantiated by the fact that Darzac was in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room and was permitted to get away. That hypothesis I believe to be\r\n\r\n      a false one.\u2014Larsan is being misled by it, though that would not\r\n\r\n      displease me, did it not affect an innocent person. Now does that\r\n\r\n      hypothesis really mislead Frederic Larsan? That is the question\u2014that\r\n\r\n      is the question.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps he is right,\u201d I cried, interrupting Rouletabille. \u201cAre you sure\r\n\r\n      that Monsieur Darzac is innocent?\u2014It seems to me that these are\r\n\r\n      extraordinary coincidences\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCoincidences,\u201d replied my friend, \u201care the worst enemies to truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does the examining magistrate think now of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur de Marquet hesitates to accuse Monsieur Darzac, in the absence\r\n\r\n      of absolute proofs. Not only would he have public opinion wholly against\r\n\r\n      him, to say nothing of the Sorbonne, but Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. She adores Monsieur Robert Darzac. Indistinctly as she saw the\r\n\r\n      murderer, it would be hard to make the public believe that she could not\r\n\r\n      have recognised him, if Darzac had been the criminal. No doubt The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room was very dimly lit; but a night-light, however small, gives some\r\n\r\n      light. Here, my boy, is how things stood when, three days, or rather three\r\n\r\n      nights ago, an extraordinarily strange incident occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XIV. \u201cI Expect the Assassin This Evening\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI must take you,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cso as to enable you to understand,\r\n\r\n      to the various scenes. I myself believe that I have discovered what\r\n\r\n      everybody else is searching for, namely, how the murderer escaped from The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room, without any accomplice, and without Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      having had anything to do with it. But so long as I am not sure of the\r\n\r\n      real murderer, I cannot state the theory on which I am working. I can only\r\n\r\n      say that I believe it to be correct and, in any case, a quite natural and\r\n\r\n      simple one. As to what happened in this place three nights ago, I must say\r\n\r\n      it kept me wondering for a whole day and a night. It passes all belief.\r\n\r\n      The theory I have formed from the incident is so absurd that I would\r\n\r\n      rather matters remained as yet unexplained.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Saying which the young reporter invited me to go and make the tour of the\r\n\r\n      chateau with him. The only sound to be heard was the crunching of the dead\r\n\r\n      leaves beneath our feet. The silence was so intense that one might have\r\n\r\n      thought the chateau had been abandoned. The old stones, the stagnant water\r\n\r\n      of the ditch surrounding the donjon, the bleak ground strewn with the dead\r\n\r\n      leaves, the dark, skeleton-like outlines of the trees, all contributed to\r\n\r\n      give to the desolate place, now filled with its awful mystery, a most\r\n\r\n      funereal aspect. As we passed round the donjon, we met the Green Man, the\r\n\r\n      forest-keeper, who did not greet us, but walked by as if we had not\r\n\r\n      existed. He was looking just as I had formerly seen him through the window\r\n\r\n      of the Donjon Inn. He had still his fowling-piece slung at his back, his\r\n\r\n      pipe was in his mouth, and his eye-glasses on his nose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn odd kind of fish!\u201d Rouletabille said to me, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you spoken to him?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, but I could get nothing out of him. His only answers are grunts and\r\n\r\n      shrugs of the shoulders. He generally lives on the first floor of the\r\n\r\n      donjon, a big room that once served for an oratory. He lives like a bear,\r\n\r\n      never goes out without his gun, and is only pleasant with the girls. The\r\n\r\n      women, for twelve miles round, are all setting their caps for him. For the\r\n\r\n      present, he is paying attention to Madame Mathieu, whose husband is\r\n\r\n      keeping a lynx eye upon her in consequence.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      After passing the donjon, which is situated at the extreme end of the left\r\n\r\n      wing, we went to the back of the chateau. Rouletabille, pointing to a\r\n\r\n      window which I recognised as the only one belonging to Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s apartment, said to me:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you had been here, two nights ago, you would have seen your humble\r\n\r\n      servant at the top of a ladder, about to enter the chateau by that\r\n\r\n      window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As I expressed some surprise at this piece of nocturnal gymnastics, he\r\n\r\n      begged me to notice carefully the exterior disposition of the chateau. We\r\n\r\n      then went back into the building.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI must now show you the first floor of the chateau, where I am living,\u201d\r\n\r\n       said my friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      To enable the reader the better to understand the disposition of these\r\n\r\n      parts of the dwelling, I annex a plan of the first floor of the right\r\n\r\n      wing, drawn by Rouletabille the day after the extraordinary phenomenon\r\n\r\n      occurred, the details of which I am about to relate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille motioned me to follow him up a magnificent flight of stairs\r\n\r\n      ending in a landing on the first floor. From this landing one could pass\r\n\r\n      to the right or left wing of the chateau by a gallery opening from it.\r\n\r\n      This gallery, high and wide, extended along the whole length of the\r\n\r\n      building and was lit from the front of the chateau facing the north. The\r\n\r\n      rooms, the windows of which looked to the south, opened out of the\r\n\r\n      gallery. Professor Stangerson inhabited the left wing of the building.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had her apartment in the right wing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We entered the gallery to the right. A narrow carpet, laid on the waxed\r\n\r\n      oaken floor, which shone like glass, deadened the sound of our footsteps.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille asked me, in a low tone, to walk carefully, as we were\r\n\r\n      passing the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s apartment. This consisted of\r\n\r\n      a bed-room, an ante-room, a small bath-room, a boudoir, and a\r\n\r\n      drawing-room. One could pass from one to another of these rooms without\r\n\r\n      having to go by way of the gallery. The gallery continued straight to the\r\n\r\n      western end of the building, where it was lit by a high window (window 2\r\n\r\n      on the plan). At about two-thirds of its length this gallery, at a right\r\n\r\n      angle, joined another gallery following the course of the right wing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The better to follow this narrative, we shall call the gallery leading\r\n\r\n      from the stairs to the eastern window, the \u201cright\u201d gallery and the gallery\r\n\r\n      quitting it at a right angle, the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery (winding gallery\r\n\r\n      in the plan). It was at the meeting point of the two galleries that\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had his chamber, adjoining that of Frederic Larsan, the door\r\n\r\n      of each opening on to the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery, while the doors of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s apartment opened into the \u201cright\u201d gallery. (See\r\n\r\n      the plan.)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille opened the door of his room and after we had passed in,\r\n\r\n      carefully drew the bolt. I had not had time to glance round the place in\r\n\r\n      which he had been installed, when he uttered a cry of surprise and pointed\r\n\r\n      to a pair of eye-glasses on a side-table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are these doing here?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I should have been puzzled to answer him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, \u201cI wonder if this is what I have been searching for.\r\n\r\n      I wonder if these are the eye-glasses from the presbytery!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He seized them eagerly, his fingers caressing the glass. Then looking at\r\n\r\n      me, with an expression of terror on his face, he murmured, \u201cOh!\u2014Oh!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He repeated the exclamation again and again, as if his thoughts had\r\n\r\n      suddenly turned his brain.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He rose and, putting his hand on my shoulder, laughed like one demented as\r\n\r\n      he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThose glasses will drive me silly! Mathematically speaking the thing is\r\n\r\n      possible; but humanly speaking it is impossible\u2014or afterwards\u2014or\r\n\r\n      afterwards\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Two light knocks struck the door. Rouletabille opened it. A figure\r\n\r\n      entered. I recognised the concierge, whom I had seen when she was being\r\n\r\n      taken to the pavilion for examination. I was surprised, thinking she was\r\n\r\n      still under lock and key. This woman said in a very low tone:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the grove of the parquet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille replied: \u201cThanks.\u201d\u2014The woman then left. He again turned\r\n\r\n      to me, his look haggard, after having carefully refastened the door,\r\n\r\n      muttering some incomprehensible phrases.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf the thing is mathematically possible, why should it not be humanly!\u2014And\r\n\r\n      if it is humanly possible, the matter is simply awful.\u201d I interrupted him\r\n\r\n      in his soliloquy:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave they set the concierges at liberty, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI had them liberated, I needed people I could trust.\r\n\r\n      The woman is thoroughly devoted to me, and her husband would lay down his\r\n\r\n      life for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOho!\u201d I said, \u201cwhen will he have occasion to do it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis evening,\u2014for this evening I expect the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou expect the murderer this evening? Then you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall know him; but I should be mad to affirm, categorically, at this\r\n\r\n      moment that I do know him. The mathematical idea I have of the murderer\r\n\r\n      gives results so frightful, so monstrous, that I hope it is still possible\r\n\r\n      that I am mistaken. I hope so, with all my heart!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFive minutes ago, you did not know the murderer; how can you say that you\r\n\r\n      expect him this evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I know that he must come.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille very slowly filled his pipe and lit it. That meant an\r\n\r\n      interesting story. At that moment we heard some one walking in the gallery\r\n\r\n      and passing before our door. Rouletabille listened. The sound of the\r\n\r\n      footstep died away in the distance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs Frederic Larsan in his room?\u201d I asked, pointing to the partition.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d my friend answered. \u201cHe went to Paris this morning,\u2014still on\r\n\r\n      the scent of Darzac, who also left for Paris. That matter will turn out\r\n\r\n      badly. I expect that Monsieur Darzac will be arrested in the course of the\r\n\r\n      next week. The worst of it is that everything seems to be in league\r\n\r\n      against him,\u2014circumstances, things, people. Not an hour passes\r\n\r\n      without bringing some new evidence against him. The examining magistrate\r\n\r\n      is overwhelmed by it\u2014and blind.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic Larsan, however, is not a novice,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI thought so,\u201d said Rouletabille, with a slightly contemptuous turn of\r\n\r\n      his lips, \u201cI fancied he was a much abler man. I had, indeed, a great\r\n\r\n      admiration for him, before I got to know his method of working. It\u2019s\r\n\r\n      deplorable. He owes his reputation solely to his ability; but he lacks\r\n\r\n      reasoning power,\u2014the mathematics of his ideas are very poor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I looked closely at Rouletabille and could not help smiling, on hearing\r\n\r\n      this boy of eighteen talking of a man who had proved to the world that he\r\n\r\n      was the finest police sleuth in Europe.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou smile,\u201d he said? \u201cyou are wrong! I swear I will outwit him\u2014and\r\n\r\n      in a striking way! But I must make haste about it, for he has an enormous\r\n\r\n      start on me\u2014given him by Monsieur Robert Darzac, who is this evening\r\n\r\n      going to increase it still more. Think of it!\u2014every time the\r\n\r\n      murderer comes to the chateau, Monsieur Darzac, by a strange fatality,\r\n\r\n      absents himself and refuses to give any account of how he employs his\r\n\r\n      time.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvery time the assassin comes to the chateau!\u201d I cried. \u201cHas he returned\r\n\r\n      then\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, during that famous night when the strange phenomenon occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was now going to learn about the astonishing phenomenon to which\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had made allusion half an hour earlier without giving me any\r\n\r\n      explanation of it. But I had learned never to press Rouletabille in his\r\n\r\n      narratives. He spoke when the fancy took him and when he judged it to be\r\n\r\n      right. He was less concerned about my curiosity than he was for making a\r\n\r\n      complete summing up for himself of any important matter in which he was\r\n\r\n      interested.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At last, in short rapid phrases, he acquainted me with things which\r\n\r\n      plunged me into a state bordering on complete bewilderment. Indeed, the\r\n\r\n      results of that still unknown science known as hypnotism, for example,\r\n\r\n      were not more inexplicable than the disappearance of the \u201cmatter\u201d of the\r\n\r\n      murderer at the moment when four persons were within touch of him. I speak\r\n\r\n      of hypnotism as I would of electricity, for of the nature of both we are\r\n\r\n      ignorant and we know little of their laws. I cite these examples because,\r\n\r\n      at the time, the case appeared to me to be only explicable by the\r\n\r\n      inexplicable,\u2014that is to say, by an event outside of known natural\r\n\r\n      laws. And yet, if I had had Rouletabille\u2019s brain, I should, like him, have\r\n\r\n      had a presentiment of the natural explanation; for the most curious thing\r\n\r\n      about all the mysteries of the Glandier case was the natural manner in\r\n\r\n      which he explained them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I have among the papers that were sent me by the young man, after the\r\n\r\n      affair was over, a note-book of his, in which a complete account is given\r\n\r\n      of the phenomenon of the disappearance of the \u201cmatter\u201d of the assassin,\r\n\r\n      and the thoughts to which it gave rise in the mind of my young friend. It\r\n\r\n      is preferable, I think, to give the reader this account, rather than\r\n\r\n      continue to reproduce my conversation with Rouletabille; for I should be\r\n\r\n      afraid, in a history of this nature, to add a word that was not in\r\n\r\n      accordance with the strictest truth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XV. The Trap\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      (EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLast night\u2014the night between the 29th and 30th of October\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n       wrote Joseph Rouletabille, \u201cI woke up towards one o\u2019clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n      Was it sleeplessness, or noise without?\u2014The cry of the Bete du Bon\r\n\r\n      Dieu rang out with sinister loudness from the end of the park. I rose and\r\n\r\n      opened the window. Cold wind and rain; opaque darkness; silence. I\r\n\r\n      reclosed my window. Again the sound of the cat\u2019s weird cry in the\r\n\r\n      distance. I partly dressed in haste. The weather was too bad for even a\r\n\r\n      cat to be turned out in it. What did it mean, then\u2014that imitating of\r\n\r\n      the mewing of Mother Angenoux\u2019 cat so near the chateau? I seized a\r\n\r\n      good-sized stick, the only weapon I had, and, without making any noise,\r\n\r\n      opened the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe gallery into which I went was well lit by a lamp with a reflector. I\r\n\r\n      felt a keen current of air and, on turning, found the window open, at the\r\n\r\n      extreme end of the gallery, which I call the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, to\r\n\r\n      distinguish it from the \u2018right\u2019 gallery, on to which the apartment of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson opened. These two galleries cross each other at\r\n\r\n      right angles. Who had left that window open? Or, who had come to open it?\r\n\r\n      I went to the window and leaned out. Five feet below me there was a sort\r\n\r\n      of terrace over the semi-circular projection of a room on the\r\n\r\n      ground-floor. One could, if one wanted, jump from the window on to the\r\n\r\n      terrace, and allow oneself to drop from it into the court of the chateau.\r\n\r\n      Whoever had entered by this road had, evidently, not had a key to the\r\n\r\n      vestibule door. But why should I be thinking of my previous night\u2019s\r\n\r\n      attempt with the ladder?\u2014Because of the open window\u2014left open,\r\n\r\n      perhaps, by the negligence of a servant? I reclosed it, smiling at the\r\n\r\n      ease with which I built a drama on the mere suggestion of an open window.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAgain the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu!\u2014and then silence. The rain\r\n\r\n      ceased to beat on the window. All in the chateau slept. I walked with\r\n\r\n      infinite precaution on the carpet of the gallery. On reaching the corner\r\n\r\n      of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery, I peered round it cautiously. There was another\r\n\r\n      lamp there with a reflector which quite lit up the several objects in it,\u2014three\r\n\r\n      chairs and some pictures hanging on the wall. What was I doing there?\r\n\r\n      Perfect silence reigned throughout. Everything was sunk in repose. What\r\n\r\n      was the instinct that urged me towards Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber?\r\n\r\n      Why did a voice within me cry: \u2018Go on, to the chamber of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson!\u2019 I cast my eyes down upon the carpet on which I was treading\r\n\r\n      and saw that my steps were being directed towards Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s chamber by the marks of steps that had already been made\r\n\r\n      there. Yes, on the carpet were traces of footsteps stained with mud\r\n\r\n      leading to the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson. Horror! Horror!\u2014I\r\n\r\n      recognised in those footprints the impression of the neat boots of the\r\n\r\n      murderer! He had come, then, from without in this wretched night. If you\r\n\r\n      could descend from the gallery by way of the window, by means of the\r\n\r\n      terrace, then you could get into the chateau by the same means.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe murderer was still in the chateau, for here were marks as of\r\n\r\n      returning footsteps. He had entered by the open window at the extremity of\r\n\r\n      the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery; he had passed Frederic Larsan\u2019s door and mine,\r\n\r\n      had turned to the right, and had entered Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room. I\r\n\r\n      am before the door of her ante-room\u2014it is open. I push it, without\r\n\r\n      making the least noise. Under the door of the room itself I see a streak\r\n\r\n      of light. I listen\u2014no sound\u2014not even of breathing! Ah!\u2014if\r\n\r\n      I only knew what was passing in the silence that is behind that door! I\r\n\r\n      find the door locked and the key turned on the inner side. And the\r\n\r\n      murderer is there, perhaps. He must be there! Will he escape this time?\u2014All\r\n\r\n      depends on me!\u2014I must be calm, and above all, I must make no false\r\n\r\n      steps. I must see into that room. I can enter it by Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s drawing-room; but, to do that I should have to cross her\r\n\r\n      boudoir; and while I am there, the murderer may escape by the gallery door\u2014the\r\n\r\n      door in front of which I am now standing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure that no other crime is being committed, on this night; for\r\n\r\n      there is complete silence in the boudoir, where two nurses are taking care\r\n\r\n      of Mademoiselle Stangerson until she is restored to health.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs I am almost sure that the murderer is there, why do I not at once give\r\n\r\n      the alarm? The murderer may, perhaps, escape; but, perhaps, I may be able\r\n\r\n      to save Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s life. Suppose the murderer on this\r\n\r\n      occasion is not here to murder? The door has been opened to allow him to\r\n\r\n      enter; by whom?\u2014And it has been refastened\u2014by whom?\u2014Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson shuts herself up in her apartment with her nurses every night.\r\n\r\n      Who turned the key of that chamber to allow the murderer to enter?\u2014The\r\n\r\n      nurses,\u2014two faithful domestics? The old chambermaid, Sylvia? It is\r\n\r\n      very improbable. Besides, they slept in the boudoir, and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, very nervous and careful, Monsieur Robert Darzac told me, sees\r\n\r\n      to her own safety since she has been well enough to move about in her\r\n\r\n      room, which I have not yet seen her leave. This nervousness and sudden\r\n\r\n      care on her part, which had struck Monsieur Darzac, had given me, also,\r\n\r\n      food for thought. At the time of the crime in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, there can\r\n\r\n      be no doubt that she expected the murderer. Was he expected this night?\u2014Was\r\n\r\n      it she herself who had opened her door to him? Had she some reason for\r\n\r\n      doing so? Was she obliged to do it?\u2014Was it a meeting for purposes of\r\n\r\n      crime?\u2014Certainly it was not a lover\u2019s meeting, for I believe\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson adores Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll these reflections ran through my brain like a flash of lightning.\r\n\r\n      What would I not give to know!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is possible that there was some reason for the awful silence. My\r\n\r\n      intervention might do more harm than good. How could I tell? How could I\r\n\r\n      know I might not any moment cause another crime? If I could only see and\r\n\r\n      know, without breaking that silence!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI left the ante-room and descended the central stairs to the vestibule\r\n\r\n      and, as silently as possible, made my way to the little room on the\r\n\r\n      ground-floor where Daddy Jacques had been sleeping since the attack made\r\n\r\n      at the pavilion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI found him dressed, his eyes wide open, almost haggard. He did not seem\r\n\r\n      surprised to see me. He told me that he had got up because he had heard\r\n\r\n      the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu, and because he had heard footsteps in the\r\n\r\n      park, close to his window, out of which he had looked and, just then, had\r\n\r\n      seen a black shadow pass by. I asked him whether he had a firearm of any\r\n\r\n      kind. No, he no longer kept one, since the examining magistrate had taken\r\n\r\n      his revolver from him. We went out together, by a little back door, into\r\n\r\n      the park, and stole along the chateau to the point which is just below\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s window.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI placed Daddy Jacques against the wall, ordering him not to stir from\r\n\r\n      the spot, while I, taking advantage of a moment when the moon was hidden\r\n\r\n      by a cloud, moved to the front of the window, out of the patch of light\r\n\r\n      which came from it,\u2014for the window was half-open! If I could only\r\n\r\n      know what was passing in that silent chamber! I returned to Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      and whispered the word \u2018ladder\u2019 in his ear. At first I had thought of the\r\n\r\n      tree which, a week ago, served me for an observatory; but I immediately\r\n\r\n      saw that, from the way the window was half-opened, I should not be able to\r\n\r\n      see from that point of view anything that was passing in the room; and I\r\n\r\n      wanted, not only to see, but to hear, and\u2014to act.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGreatly agitated, almost trembling, Daddy Jacques disappeared for a\r\n\r\n      moment and returned without the ladder, but making signs to me with his\r\n\r\n      arms, as signals to me to come quickly to him. When I got near him he\r\n\r\n      gasped: \u2018Come!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHe led me round the ch\u00e2teau, past the don-jon. Arrived there, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I went to the donjon in search of my ladder, and in the lower part of\r\n\r\n      the donjon which serves me and the gardener for a lumber room, I found the\r\n\r\n      door open and the ladder gone. On coming out, that\u2019s what I caught sight\r\n\r\n      of by the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd he pointed to the further end of the chateau, where a ladder stood\r\n\r\n      resting against the stone brackets supporting the terrace, under the\r\n\r\n      window which I had found open. The projection of the terrace had prevented\r\n\r\n      my seeing it. Thanks to that ladder, it was quite easy to get into the\r\n\r\n      \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery of the first floor, and I had no doubt of it having\r\n\r\n      been the road taken by the unknown.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe ran to the ladder, but at the moment of reaching it, Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      drew my attention to the half-open door of the little semi-circular room,\r\n\r\n      situated under the terrace, at the extremity of the right wing of the\r\n\r\n      chateau, having the terrace for its roof. Daddy Jacques pushed the door\r\n\r\n      open a little further and looked in.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He\u2019s not there!\u201d he whispered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho is not there?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe forest\u2014keeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      With his lips once more to my ear, he added:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Do you know that he has slept in the upper room of the donjon ever since\r\n\r\n      it was restored?\u2019 And with the same gesture he pointed to the half-open\r\n\r\n      door, the ladder, the terrace, and the windows in the \u2018off-turning\u2019\r\n\r\n      gallery which, a little while before, I had re-closed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat were my thoughts then? I had no time to think. I felt more than I\r\n\r\n      thought.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently, I felt, if the forest-keeper is up there in the chamber (I\r\n\r\n      say, if, because at this moment, apart from the presence of the ladder and\r\n\r\n      his vacant room, there are no evidences which permit me even to suspect\r\n\r\n      him)\u2014if he is there, he has been obliged to pass by the ladder, and\r\n\r\n      the rooms which lie behind his, in his new lodging, are occupied by the\r\n\r\n      family of the steward and by the cook, and by the kitchens, which bar the\r\n\r\n      way by the vestibule to the interior of the chateau. And if he had been\r\n\r\n      there during the evening on any pretext, it would have been easy for him\r\n\r\n      to go into the gallery and see that the window could be simply pushed open\r\n\r\n      from the outside. This question of the unfastened window easily narrowed\r\n\r\n      the field of search for the murderer. He must belong to the house, unless\r\n\r\n      he had an accomplice, which I do not believe he had; unless\u2014unless\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson herself had seen that that window was not fastened\r\n\r\n      from the inside. But, then,\u2014what could be the frightful secret which\r\n\r\n      put her under the necessity of doing away with obstacles that separated\r\n\r\n      her from the murderer?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI seized hold of the ladder, and we returned to the back of the chateau\r\n\r\n      to see if the window of the chamber was still half-open. The blind was\r\n\r\n      drawn but did not join and allowed a bright stream of light to escape and\r\n\r\n      fall upon the path at our feet. I planted the ladder under the window. I\r\n\r\n      am almost sure that I made no noise; and while Daddy Jacques remained at\r\n\r\n      the foot of the ladder, I mounted it, very quietly, my stout stick in my\r\n\r\n      hand. I held my breath and lifted my feet with the greatest care. Suddenly\r\n\r\n      a heavy cloud discharged itself at that moment in a fresh downpour of\r\n\r\n      rain.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt the same instant the sinister cry of the Bete du bon Dieu arrested me\r\n\r\n      in my ascent. It seemed to me to have come from close by me\u2014only a\r\n\r\n      few yards away. Was the cry a signal?\u2014Had some accomplice of the man\r\n\r\n      seen me on the ladder!\u2014Would the cry bring the man to the window?\u2014Perhaps!\r\n\r\n      Ah, there he was at the window! I felt his head above me. I heard the\r\n\r\n      sound of his breath! I could not look up towards him; the least movement\r\n\r\n      of my head, and\u2014I might be lost. Would he see me?\u2014Would he\r\n\r\n      peer into the darkness? No; he went away. He had seen nothing. I felt,\r\n\r\n      rather than heard, him moving on tip-toe in the room; and I mounted a few\r\n\r\n      steps higher. My head reached to the level of the window-sill; my forehead\r\n\r\n      rose above it; my eyes looked between the opening in the blinds\u2014and\r\n\r\n      I saw\u2014A man seated at Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s little desk,\r\n\r\n      writing. His back was turned toward me. A candle was lit before him, and\r\n\r\n      he bent over the flame, the light from it projecting shapeless shadows. I\r\n\r\n      saw nothing but a monstrous, stooping back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson herself was not there!\u2014Her bed had not been\r\n\r\n      lain on! Where, then, was she sleeping that night? Doubtless in the\r\n\r\n      side-room with her women. Perhaps this was but a guess. I must content\r\n\r\n      myself with the joy of finding the man alone. I must be calm to prepare my\r\n\r\n      trap.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut who, then, is this man writing there before my eyes, seated at the\r\n\r\n      desk, as if he were in his own home? If there had not been that ladder\r\n\r\n      under the window; if there had not been those footprints on the carpet in\r\n\r\n      the gallery; if there had not been that open window, I might have been led\r\n\r\n      to think that this man had a right to be there, and that he was there as a\r\n\r\n      matter of course and for reasons about which as yet I knew nothing. But\r\n\r\n      there was no doubt that this mysterious unknown was the man of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room,\u2014the man to whose murderous assault Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014without\r\n\r\n      denouncing him\u2014had had to submit. If I could but see his face!\r\n\r\n      Surprise and capture him!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I spring into the room at this moment, he will escape by the\r\n\r\n      right-hand door opening into the boudoir,\u2014or crossing the\r\n\r\n      drawing-room, he will reach the gallery and I shall lose him. I have him\r\n\r\n      now and in five minutes more he\u2019ll be safer than if I had him in a cage.\u2014What\r\n\r\n      is he doing there, alone in Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room?\u2014What is\r\n\r\n      he writing? I descend and place the ladder on the ground. Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      follows me. We re-enter the chateau. I send Daddy Jacques to wake Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, and instruct him to await my coming in Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s room and to say nothing definite to him before my arrival. I\r\n\r\n      will go and awaken Frederic Larsan. It\u2019s a bore to have to do it, for I\r\n\r\n      should have liked to work alone and to have carried off all the honors of\r\n\r\n      this affair myself, right under the very nose of the sleeping detective.\r\n\r\n      But Daddy Jacques and Monsieur Stangerson are old men, and I am not yet\r\n\r\n      fully developed. I might not be strong enough. Larsan is used to wrestling\r\n\r\n      and putting on the handcuffs. He opened his eyes swollen with sleep, ready\r\n\r\n      to send me flying, without in the least believing in my reporter\u2019s\r\n\r\n      fancies. I had to assure him that the man was there!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That\u2019s strange!\u2019 he said; \u2018I thought I left him this afternoon in\r\n\r\n      Paris.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe dressed himself in haste and armed himself with a revolver. We stole\r\n\r\n      quietly into the gallery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where is he?\u2019 Larsan asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And\u2014Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018She is not in there.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s go in.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t go there! On the least alarm the man will escape. He has four ways\r\n\r\n      by which to do it\u2014the door, the window, the boudoir, or the room in\r\n\r\n      which the women are sleeping.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll draw him from below.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And if you fail?\u2014If you only succeed in wounding him\u2014he\u2019ll\r\n\r\n      escape again, without reckoning that he is certainly armed. No, let me\r\n\r\n      direct the expedition, and I\u2019ll answer for everything.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018As you like,\u2019 he replied, with fairly good grace.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, after satisfying myself that all the windows of the two galleries\r\n\r\n      were thoroughly secure, I placed Frederic Larsan at the end of the\r\n\r\n      \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, before the window which I had found open and had\r\n\r\n      reclosed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Under no consideration,\u2019 I said to him, \u2018must you stir from this post\r\n\r\n      till I call you. The chances are even that the man, when he is pursued,\r\n\r\n      will return to this window and try to save himself that way; for it is by\r\n\r\n      that way he came in and made a way ready for his flight. You have a\r\n\r\n      dangerous post.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What will be yours?\u2019 asked Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I shall spring into the room and knock him over for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Take my revolver,\u2019 said Fred, \u2018and I\u2019ll take your stick.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Thanks,\u2019 I said; \u2018You are a brave man.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI accepted his offer. I was going to be alone with the man in the room\r\n\r\n      writing and was really thankful to have the weapon.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI left Fred, having posted him at the window (No. 5 on the plan), and,\r\n\r\n      with the greatest precaution, went towards Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s apartment\r\n\r\n      in the left wing of the chateau. I found him with Daddy Jacques, who had\r\n\r\n      faithfully obeyed my directions, confining himself to asking his master to\r\n\r\n      dress as quickly as possible. In a few words I explained to Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson what was passing. He armed himself with a revolver, followed\r\n\r\n      me, and we were all three speedily in the gallery. Since I had seen the\r\n\r\n      murderer seated at the desk ten minutes had elapsed. Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n      wished to spring upon the assassin at once and kill him. I made him\r\n\r\n      understand that, above all, he must not, in his desire to kill him, miss\r\n\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I had sworn to him that his daughter was not in the room, and in no\r\n\r\n      danger, he conquered his impatience and left me to direct the operations.\r\n\r\n      I told them that they must come to me the moment I called to them, or when\r\n\r\n      I fired my revolver. I then sent Daddy Jacques to place himself before the\r\n\r\n      window at the end of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery. (No. 2 on my plan.) I chose that\r\n\r\n      position \u2018for Daddy Jacques because I believed that the murderer, tracked,\r\n\r\n      on leaving the room, would run through the gallery towards the window\r\n\r\n      which he had left open, and, instantly seeing that it was guarded by\r\n\r\n      Larsan, would pursue his course along the \u2018right\u2019 gallery. There he would\r\n\r\n      encounter Daddy Jacques, who would prevent his springing out of the window\r\n\r\n      into the park. Under that window there was a sort of buttress, while all\r\n\r\n      the other windows in the galleries were at such a height from the ground\r\n\r\n      that it was almost impossible to jump from them without breaking one\u2019s\r\n\r\n      neck. All the doors and windows, including those of the lumber-room at the\r\n\r\n      end of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery\u2014as I had rapidly assured myself\u2014were\r\n\r\n      strongly secured.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHaving indicated to Daddy Jacques the post he was to occupy, and having\r\n\r\n      seen him take up his position, I placed Monsieur Stangerson on the landing\r\n\r\n      at the head of the stairs not far from the door of his daughter\u2019s\r\n\r\n      ante-room, rather than the boudoir, where the women were, and the door of\r\n\r\n      which must have been locked by Mademoiselle Stangerson herself if, as I\r\n\r\n      thought, she had taken refuge in the boudoir for the purpose of avoiding\r\n\r\n      the murderer who was coming to see her. In any case, he must return to the\r\n\r\n      gallery where my people were awaiting him at every possible exit.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn coming there, he would see on his left, Monsieur Stangerson; he would\r\n\r\n      turn to the right, towards the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery\u2014the way he had\r\n\r\n      pre-arranged for flight, where, at the intersection of the two galleries,\r\n\r\n      he would see at once, as I have explained, on his left, Frederic Larsan at\r\n\r\n      the end of the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, and in front, Daddy Jacques, at the\r\n\r\n      end of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery. Monsieur Stangerson and myself would arrive by\r\n\r\n      way of the back of the chateau.\u2014He is ours!\u2014He can no longer\r\n\r\n      escape us! I was sure of that.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe plan I had formed seemed to me the best, the surest, and the most\r\n\r\n      simple. It would, no doubt, have been simpler still, if we had been able\r\n\r\n      to place some one directly behind the door of Mademoiselle\u2019s boudoir,\r\n\r\n      which opened out of her bedchamber, and, in that way, had been in a\r\n\r\n      position to besiege the two doors of the room in which the man was. But we\r\n\r\n      could not penetrate the boudoir except by way of the drawing-room, the\r\n\r\n      door of which had been locked on the inside by Mademoiselle Stangerson.\r\n\r\n      But even if I had had the free disposition of the boudoir, I should have\r\n\r\n      held to the plan I had formed; because any other plan of attack would have\r\n\r\n      separated us at the moment of the struggle with the man, while my plan\r\n\r\n      united us all for the attack, at a spot which I had selected with almost\r\n\r\n      mathematical precision,\u2014the intersection of the two galleries.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHaving so placed my people, I again left the chateau, hurried to my\r\n\r\n      ladder, and, replacing it, climbed up, revolver in hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf there be any inclined to smile at my taking so many precautionary\r\n\r\n      measures, I refer them to the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, and to all the\r\n\r\n      proofs we have of the weird cunning of the murderer. Further, if there be\r\n\r\n      some who think my observations needlessly minute at a moment when they\r\n\r\n      ought to be completely held by rapidity of movement and decision of\r\n\r\n      action, I reply that I have wished to report here, at length and\r\n\r\n      completely, all the details of a plan of attack conceived so rapidly that\r\n\r\n      it is only the slowness of my pen that gives an appearance of slowness to\r\n\r\n      the execution. I have wished, by this slowness and precision, to be\r\n\r\n      certain that nothing should be omitted from the conditions under which the\r\n\r\n      strange phenomenon was produced, which, until some natural explanation of\r\n\r\n      it is forthcoming, seems to me to prove, even better than the theories of\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson, the Dissociation of Matter\u2014I will even say,\r\n\r\n      the instantaneous Dissociation of Matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVI. Strange Phenomenon of the Dissociation of Matter\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      (EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, continued)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am again at the window-sill,\u201d continues Rouletabille, \u201cand once more I\r\n\r\n      raise my head above it. Through an opening in the curtains, the\r\n\r\n      arrangement of which has not been changed, I am ready to look, anxious to\r\n\r\n      note the position in which I am going to find the murderer,\u2014whether\r\n\r\n      his back will still be turned towards me!\u2014whether he is still seated\r\n\r\n      at the desk writing! But perhaps\u2014perhaps\u2014he is no longer\r\n\r\n      there!\u2014Yet how could he have fled?\u2014Was I not in possession of\r\n\r\n      his ladder? I force myself to be cool. I raise my head yet higher. I look\u2014he\r\n\r\n      is still there. I see his monstrous back, deformed by the shadow thrown by\r\n\r\n      the candle. He is no longer writing now, and the candle is on the parquet,\r\n\r\n      over which he is bending\u2014a position which serves my purpose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hold my breath. I mount the ladder. I am on the uppermost rung of it,\r\n\r\n      and with my left hand seize hold of the window-sill. In this moment of\r\n\r\n      approaching success, I feel my heart beating wildly. I put my revolver\r\n\r\n      between my teeth. A quick spring, and I shall be on the window-ledge. But\u2014the\r\n\r\n      ladder! I had been obliged to press on it heavily, and my foot had\r\n\r\n      scarcely left it, when I felt it swaying beneath me. It grated on the wall\r\n\r\n      and fell. But, already, my knees were touching the window-sill, and, by a\r\n\r\n      movement quick as lightning, I got on to it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the murderer had been even quicker than I had been. He had heard the\r\n\r\n      grating of the ladder on the wall, and I saw the monstrous back of the man\r\n\r\n      raise itself. I saw his head. Did I really see it?\u2014The candle on the\r\n\r\n      parquet lit up his legs only. Above the height of the table the chamber\r\n\r\n      was in darkness. I saw a man with long hair, a full beard, wild-looking\r\n\r\n      eyes, a pale face, framed in large whiskers,\u2014as well as I could\r\n\r\n      distinguish, and, as I think\u2014red in colour. I did not know the face.\r\n\r\n      That was, in brief, the chief sensation I received from that face in the\r\n\r\n      dim half-light in which I saw it. I did not know it\u2014or, at least, I\r\n\r\n      did not recognise it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow for quick action! It was indeed time for that, for as I was about to\r\n\r\n      place my legs through the window, the man had seen me, had bounded to his\r\n\r\n      feet, had sprung\u2014as I foresaw he would\u2014to the door of the\r\n\r\n      ante-chamber, had time to open it, and fled. But I was already behind him,\r\n\r\n      revolver in hand, shouting \u2018Help!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLike an arrow I crossed the room, but noticed a letter on the table as I\r\n\r\n      rushed. I almost came up with the man in the ante-room, for he had lost\r\n\r\n      time in opening the door to the gallery. I flew on wings, and in the\r\n\r\n      gallery was but a few feet behind him. He had taken, as I supposed he\r\n\r\n      would, the gallery on his right,\u2014that is to say, the road he had\r\n\r\n      prepared for his flight. \u2018Help, Jacques!\u2014help, Larsan!\u2019 I cried. He\r\n\r\n      could not escape us! I raised a shout of joy, of savage victory. The man\r\n\r\n      reached the intersection of the two galleries hardly two seconds before me\r\n\r\n      for the meeting which I had prepared\u2014the fatal shock which must\r\n\r\n      inevitably take place at that spot! We all rushed to the crossing-place\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and I coming from one end of the right gallery, Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      coming from the other end of the same gallery, and Frederic Larsan coming\r\n\r\n      from the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man was not there!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe looked at each other stupidly and with eyes terrified. The man had\r\n\r\n      vanished like a ghost. \u2018Where is he\u2014where is he?\u2019 we all asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It is impossible he can have escaped!\u2019 I cried, my terror mastered by my\r\n\r\n      anger.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I touched him!\u2019 exclaimed Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I felt his breath on my face!\u2019 cried Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where is he?\u2019\u2014where is he?\u2019 we all cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe raced like madmen along the two galleries; we visited doors and\r\n\r\n      windows\u2014they were closed, hermetically closed. They had not been\r\n\r\n      opened. Besides, the opening of a door or window by this man whom we were\r\n\r\n      hunting, without our having perceived it, would have been more\r\n\r\n      inexplicable than his disappearance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere is he?\u2014where is he?\u2014He could not have got away by a\r\n\r\n      door or a window, nor by any other way. He could not have passed through\r\n\r\n      our bodies!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI confess that, for the moment, I felt \u2018done for.\u2019 For the gallery was\r\n\r\n      perfectly lighted, and there was neither trap, nor secret door in the\r\n\r\n      walls, nor any sort of hiding-place. We moved the chairs and lifted the\r\n\r\n      pictures. Nothing!\u2014nothing! We would have looked into a flower-pot,\r\n\r\n      if there had been one to look into!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      When this mystery, thanks to Rouletabille, was naturally explained, by the\r\n\r\n      help alone of his masterful mind, we were able to realise that the\r\n\r\n      murderer had got away neither by a door, a window, nor the stairs\u2014a\r\n\r\n      fact which the judges would not admit.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVII. The Inexplicable Gallery\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson appeared at the door of her ante-room,\u201d continues\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s note-book. \u201cWe were near her door in the gallery where this\r\n\r\n      incredible phenomenon had taken place. There are moments when one feels as\r\n\r\n      if one\u2019s brain were about to burst. A bullet in the head, a fracture of\r\n\r\n      the skull, the seat of reason shattered\u2014with only these can I\r\n\r\n      compare the sensation which exhausted and left me void of sense.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHappily, Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared on the threshold of her\r\n\r\n      ante-room. I saw her, and that helped to relieve my chaotic state of mind.\r\n\r\n      I breathed her\u2014I inhaled the perfume of the lady in black, whom I\r\n\r\n      should never see again. I would have given ten years of my life\u2014half\r\n\r\n      my life\u2014to see once more the lady in black! Alas! I no more meet her\r\n\r\n      but from time to time,\u2014and yet!\u2014and yet! how the memory of\r\n\r\n      that perfume\u2014felt by me alone\u2014carries me back to the days of\r\n\r\n      my childhood.* It was this sharp reminder from my beloved perfume, of the\r\n\r\n      lady in black, which made me go to her\u2014dressed wholly in white and\r\n\r\n      so pale\u2014so pale and so beautiful!\u2014on the threshold of the\r\n\r\n      inexplicable gallery. Her beautiful golden hair, gathered into a knot on\r\n\r\n      the back of her neck, left visible the red star on her temple which had so\r\n\r\n      nearly been the cause of her death. When I first got on the right track of\r\n\r\n      the mystery of this case I had imagined that, on the night of the tragedy\r\n\r\n      in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, Mademoiselle Stangerson had worn her hair in bands.\r\n\r\n      But then, how could I have imagined otherwise when I had not been in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut now, since the occurrence of the inexplicable gallery, I did not\r\n\r\n      reason at all. I stood there, stupid, before the apparition\u2014so pale\r\n\r\n      and so beautiful\u2014of Mademoiselle Stangerson. She was clad in a\r\n\r\n      dressing-gown of dreamy white. One might have taken her to be a ghost\u2014a\r\n\r\n      lovely phantom. Her father took her in his arms and kissed her\r\n\r\n      passionately, as if he had recovered her after being long lost to him. I\r\n\r\n      dared not question her. He drew her into the room and we followed them,\u2014for\r\n\r\n      we had to know!\u2014The door of the boudoir was open. The terrified\r\n\r\n      faces of the two nurses craned towards us. Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      inquired the meaning of all the disturbance. That she was not in her own\r\n\r\n      room was quite easily explained\u2014quite easily. She had a fancy not to\r\n\r\n      sleep that night in her chamber, but in the boudoir with her nurses,\r\n\r\n      locking the door on them. Since the night of the crime she had experienced\r\n\r\n      feelings of terror, and fears came over her that are easily to be\r\n\r\n      comprehended.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut who could imagine that on that particular night when he was to come,\r\n\r\n      she would, by a mere chance, determine to shut herself in with her women?\r\n\r\n      Who would think that she would act contrary to her father\u2019s wish to sleep\r\n\r\n      in the drawing-room? Who could believe that the letter which had so\r\n\r\n      recently been on the table in her room would no longer be there? He who\r\n\r\n      could understand all this, would have to assume that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson knew that the murderer was coming\u2014she could not prevent\r\n\r\n      his coming again\u2014unknown to her father, unknown to all but to\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac. For he must know it now\u2014perhaps he had known\r\n\r\n      it before! Did he remember that phrase in the Elysee garden: \u2018Must I\r\n\r\n      commit a crime, then, to win you?\u2019 Against whom the crime, if not against\r\n\r\n      the obstacle, against the murderer? \u2018Ah, I would kill him with my own\r\n\r\n      hand!\u2019 And I replied, \u2018You have not answered my question.\u2019 That was the\r\n\r\n      very truth. In truth, in truth, Monsieur Darzac knew the murderer so well\r\n\r\n      that\u2014while wishing to kill him himself\u2014he was afraid I should\r\n\r\n      find him. There could be but two reasons why he had assisted me in my\r\n\r\n      investigation. First, because I forced him to do it; and, second, because\r\n\r\n      she would be the better protected.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am in the chamber\u2014her room. I look at her, also at the place\r\n\r\n      where the letter had just now been. She has possessed herself of it; it\r\n\r\n      was evidently intended for her\u2014evidently. How she trembles!\u2014Trembles\r\n\r\n      at the strange story her father is telling her, of the presence of the\r\n\r\n      murderer in her chamber, and of the pursuit. But it is plainly to be seen\r\n\r\n      that she is not wholly satisfied by the assurance given her until she had\r\n\r\n      been told that the murderer, by some incomprehensible means, had been able\r\n\r\n      to elude us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen follows a silence. What a silence! We are all there\u2014looking at\r\n\r\n      her\u2014her father, Larsan, Daddy Jacques and I. What were we all\r\n\r\n      thinking of in the silence? After the events of that night, of the mystery\r\n\r\n      of the inexplicable gallery, of the prodigious fact of the presence of the\r\n\r\n      murderer in her room, it seemed to me that all our thoughts might have\r\n\r\n      been translated into the words which were addressed to her. \u2018You who know\r\n\r\n      of this mystery, explain it to us, and we shall perhaps be able to save\r\n\r\n      you. How I longed to save her\u2014for herself, and, from the other!\u2014It\r\n\r\n      brought the tears to my eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is there, shedding about her the perfume of the lady in black. At\r\n\r\n      last, I see her, in the silence of her chamber. Since the fatal hour of\r\n\r\n      the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, we have hung about this invisible and\r\n\r\n      silent woman to learn what she knows. Our desires, our wish to know must\r\n\r\n      be a torment to her. Who can tell that, should we learn the secret of her\r\n\r\n      mystery, it would not precipitate a tragedy more terrible than that which\r\n\r\n      had already been enacted here? Who can tell if it might not mean her\r\n\r\n      death? Yet it had brought her close to death,\u2014and we still knew\r\n\r\n      nothing. Or, rather, there are some of us who know nothing. But I\u2014if\r\n\r\n      I knew who, I should know all. Who?\u2014Who?\u2014Not knowing who, I\r\n\r\n      must remain silent, out of pity for her. For there is no doubt that she\r\n\r\n      knows how he escaped from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, and yet she keeps the secret.\r\n\r\n      When I know who, I will speak to him\u2014to him!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe looked at us now\u2014with a far-away look in her eyes\u2014as if\r\n\r\n      we were not in the chamber. Monsieur Stangerson broke the silence. He\r\n\r\n      declared that, henceforth, he would no more absent himself from his\r\n\r\n      daughter\u2019s apartments. She tried to oppose him in vain. He adhered firmly\r\n\r\n      to his purpose. He would install himself there this very night, he said.\r\n\r\n      Solely concerned for the health of his daughter, he reproached her for\r\n\r\n      having left her bed. Then he suddenly began talking to her as if she were\r\n\r\n      a little child. He smiled at her and seemed not to know either what he\r\n\r\n      said or what he did. The illustrious professor had lost his head.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson in a tone of tender distress said: \u2018Father!\u2014father!\u2019\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques blows his nose, and Frederic Larsan himself is obliged to\r\n\r\n      turn away to hide his emotion. For myself, I am able neither to think or\r\n\r\n      feel. I felt an infinite contempt for myself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was the first time that Frederic Larsan, like myself, found himself\r\n\r\n      face to face with Mademoiselle Stangerson since the attack in The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room. Like me, he had insisted on being allowed to question the unhappy\r\n\r\n      lady; but he had not, any more than had I, been permitted. To him, as to\r\n\r\n      me, the same answer had always been given: Mademoiselle Stangerson was too\r\n\r\n      weak to receive us. The questionings of the examining magistrate had\r\n\r\n      over-fatigued her. It was evidently intended not to give us any assistance\r\n\r\n      in our researches. I was not surprised; but Frederic Larsan had always\r\n\r\n      resented this conduct. It is true that he and I had a totally different\r\n\r\n      theory of the crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI still catch myself repeating from the depths of my heart: \u2018Save her!\u2014save\r\n\r\n      her without his speaking!\u2019 Who is he\u2014the murderer? Take him and shut\r\n\r\n      his mouth. But Monsieur Darzac made it clear that in order to shut his\r\n\r\n      mouth he must be killed. Have I the right to kill Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s murderer? No, I had not. But let him only give me the chance!\r\n\r\n      Let me find out whether he is really a creature of flesh and blood!\u2014Let\r\n\r\n      me see his dead body, since it cannot be taken alive.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I could but make this woman, who does not even look at us, understand!\r\n\r\n      She is absorbed by her fears and by her father\u2019s distress of mind. And I\r\n\r\n      can do nothing to save her. Yes, I will go to work once more and\r\n\r\n      accomplish wonders.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI move towards her. I would speak to her. I would entreat her to have\r\n\r\n      confidence in me. I would, in a word, make her understand\u2014she alone\u2014that\r\n\r\n      I know how the murderer escaped from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\u2014that I have\r\n\r\n      guessed the motives for her secrecy\u2014and that I pity her with all my\r\n\r\n      heart. But by her gestures she begged us to leave her alone, expressing\r\n\r\n      weariness and the need for immediate rest. Monsieur Stangerson asked us to\r\n\r\n      go back to our rooms and thanked us. Frederic Larsan and I bowed to him\r\n\r\n      and, followed by Daddy Jacques, we regained the gallery. I heard Larsan\r\n\r\n      murmur: \u2018Strange! strange!\u2019 He made a sign to me to go with him into his\r\n\r\n      room. On the threshold he turned towards Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Did you see him distinctly?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Who?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The man?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Saw him!\u2014why, he had a big red beard and red hair.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That\u2019s how he appeared to me,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And to me,\u2019 said Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe great Fred and I were alone in his chamber, now, to talk over this\r\n\r\n      thing. We talked for an hour, turning the matter over and viewing it from\r\n\r\n      every side. From the questions put by him, from the explanation which he\r\n\r\n      gives me, it is clear to me that\u2014in spite of all our senses\u2014he\r\n\r\n      is persuaded the man disappeared by some secret passage in the chateau\r\n\r\n      known to him alone.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He knows the chateau,\u2019 he said to me; \u2018he knows it well.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He is a rather tall man\u2014well-built,\u2019 I suggested.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He is as tall as he wants to be,\u2019 murmured Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I understand,\u2019 I said; \u2018but how do you account for his red hair and\r\n\r\n      beard?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Too much beard\u2014too much hair\u2014false,\u2019 says Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That\u2019s easily said. You are always thinking of Robert Darzac. You can\u2019t\r\n\r\n      get rid of that idea? I am certain that he is innocent.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018So much the better. I hope so; but everything condemns him. Did you\r\n\r\n      notice the marks on the carpet?\u2014Come and look at them.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I have seen them; they are the marks of the neat boots, the same as\r\n\r\n      those we saw on the border of the lake.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Can you deny that they belong to Robert Darzac?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Of course, one may be mistaken.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Have you noticed that those footprints only go in one direction?\u2014that\r\n\r\n      there are no return marks? When the man came from the chamber, pursued by\r\n\r\n      all of us, his footsteps left no traces behind them.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He had, perhaps, been in the chamber for hours. The mud from his boots\r\n\r\n      had dried, and he moved with such rapidity on the points of his toes\u2014We\r\n\r\n      saw him running, but we did not hear his steps.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI suddenly put an end to this idle chatter\u2014void of any logic, and\r\n\r\n      made a sign to Larsan to listen.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018There\u2014below; some one is shutting a door.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI rise; Larsan follows me; we descend to the ground-floor of the chateau.\r\n\r\n      I lead him to the little semi-circular room under the terrace beneath the\r\n\r\n      window of the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery. I point to the door, now closed, open\r\n\r\n      a short time before, under which a shaft of light is visible.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The forest-keeper!\u2019 says Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Come on!\u2019 I whisper.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrepared\u2014I know not why\u2014to believe that the keeper is the\r\n\r\n      guilty man\u2014I go to the door and rap smartly on it. Some might think\r\n\r\n      that we were rather late in thinking of the keeper, since our first\r\n\r\n      business, after having found that the murderer had escaped us in the\r\n\r\n      gallery, ought to have been to search everywhere else,\u2014around the\r\n\r\n      chateau,\u2014in the park\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHad this criticism been made at the time, we could only have answered\r\n\r\n      that the assassin had disappeared from the gallery in such a way that we\r\n\r\n      thought he was no longer anywhere! He had eluded us when we all had our\r\n\r\n      hands stretched out ready to seize him\u2014when we were almost touching\r\n\r\n      him. We had no longer any ground for hoping that we could clear up the\r\n\r\n      mystery of that night.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs soon as I rapped at the door it was opened, and the keeper asked us\r\n\r\n      quietly what we wanted. He was undressed and preparing to go to bed. The\r\n\r\n      bed had not yet been disturbed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe entered and I affected surprise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Not gone to bed yet?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 he replied roughly. \u2018I have been making a round of the park and in\r\n\r\n      the woods. I am only just back\u2014and sleepy. Good-night!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Listen,\u2019 I said. \u2018An hour or so ago, there was a ladder close by your\r\n\r\n      window.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What ladder?\u2014I did not see any ladder. Good-night!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd he simply put us out of the room. When we were outside I looked at\r\n\r\n      Larsan. His face was impenetrable.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well?\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well?\u2019 he repeated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Does that open out any new view to you?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was no mistaking Larsan\u2019s bad temper. On re-entering the chateau, I\r\n\r\n      heard him mutter:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It would be strange\u2014very strange\u2014if I had deceived myself on\r\n\r\n      that point!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe seemed to be talking to me rather than to himself. He added: \u2018In any\r\n\r\n      case, we shall soon know what to think. The morning will bring light with\r\n\r\n      it.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVIII. Rouletabille Has Drawn a Circle Between the Two Bumps on\r\n\r\n      His Forehead\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      (EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, continued)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe separated on the thresholds of our rooms, with a melancholy shake of\r\n\r\n      the hands. I was glad to have aroused in him a suspicion of error. His was\r\n\r\n      an original brain, very intelligent but\u2014without method. I did not go\r\n\r\n      to bed. I awaited the coming of daylight and then went down to the front\r\n\r\n      of the chateau, and made a detour, examining every trace of footsteps\r\n\r\n      coming towards it or going from it. These, however, were so mixed and\r\n\r\n      confusing that I could make nothing of them. Here I may make a remark,\u2014I\r\n\r\n      am not accustomed to attach an exaggerated importance to exterior signs\r\n\r\n      left in the track of a crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe method which traces the criminal by means of the tracks of his\r\n\r\n      footsteps is altogether primitive. So many footprints are identical.\r\n\r\n      However, in the disturbed state of my mind, I did go into the deserted\r\n\r\n      court and did look at all the footprints I could find there, seeking for\r\n\r\n      some indication, as a basis for reasoning.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I could but find a right starting-point! In despair I seated myself on\r\n\r\n      a stone. For over an hour I busied myself with the common, ordinary work\r\n\r\n      of a policeman. Like the least intelligent of detectives I went on blindly\r\n\r\n      over the traces of footprints which told me just no more than they could.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI came to the conclusion that I was a fool, lower in the scale of\r\n\r\n      intelligence than even the police of the modern romancer. Novelists build\r\n\r\n      mountains of stupidity out of a footprint on the sand, or from an\r\n\r\n      impression of a hand on the wall. That\u2019s the way innocent men are brought\r\n\r\n      to prison. It might convince an examining magistrate or the head of a\r\n\r\n      detective department, but it\u2019s not proof. You writers forget that what the\r\n\r\n      senses furnish is not proof. If I am taking cognisance of what is offered\r\n\r\n      me by my senses I do so but to bring the results within the circle of my\r\n\r\n      reason. That circle may be the most circumscribed, but if it is, it has\r\n\r\n      this advantage\u2014it holds nothing but the truth! Yes, I swear that I\r\n\r\n      have never used the evidence of the senses but as servants to my reason. I\r\n\r\n      have never permitted them to become my master. They have not made of me\r\n\r\n      that monstrous thing,\u2014worse than a blind man,\u2014a man who sees\r\n\r\n      falsely. And that is why I can triumph over your error and your merely\r\n\r\n      animal intelligence, Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe of good courage, then, friend Rouletabille; it is impossible that the\r\n\r\n      incident of the inexplicable gallery should be outside the circle of your\r\n\r\n      reason. You know that! Then have faith and take thought with yourself and\r\n\r\n      forget not that you took hold of the right end when you drew that circle\r\n\r\n      in your brain within which to unravel this mysterious play of\r\n\r\n      circumstance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo it, once again! Go\u2014back to the gallery. Take your stand on your\r\n\r\n      reason and rest there as Frederic Larsan rests on his cane. You will then\r\n\r\n      soon prove that the great Fred is nothing but a fool.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201430th October.

With head on fire, I retraced my way to the\r\n\r\n      gallery, and without having found anything more than I had seen on the\r\n\r\n      previous night, the right hold I had taken of my reason drew me to\r\n\r\n      something so important that I was obliged to cling to it to save myself\r\n\r\n      from falling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow for the strength and patience to find sensible traces to fit in with\r\n\r\n      my thinking\u2014and these must come within the circle I have drawn\r\n\r\n      between the two bumps on my forehead!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201430th of October.

Rouletabille Invites Me to Breakfast at the Donjon Inn\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was not until later that Rouletabille sent me the note-book in which he\r\n\r\n      had written at length the story of the phenomenon of the inexplicable\r\n\r\n      gallery. On the day I arrived at the Glandier and joined him in his room,\r\n\r\n      he recounted to me, with the greatest detail, all that I have now related,\r\n\r\n      telling me also how he had spent several hours in Paris where he had\r\n\r\n      learned nothing that could be of any help to him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The event of the inexplicable gallery had occurred on the night between\r\n\r\n      the 29th and 30th of October, that is to say, three days before my return\r\n\r\n      to the chateau. It was on the 2nd of November, then, that I went back to\r\n\r\n      the Glandier, summoned there by my friend\u2019s telegram, and taking the\r\n\r\n      revolvers with me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I am now in Rouletabille\u2019s room and he has finished his recital.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      While he had been telling me the story I noticed him continually rubbing\r\n\r\n      the glass of the eyeglasses he had found on the side table. From the\r\n\r\n      evident pleasure he was taking in handling them I felt they must be one of\r\n\r\n      those sensible evidences destined to enter what he had called the circle\r\n\r\n      of the right end of his reason. That strange and unique way of his, to\r\n\r\n      express himself in terms wonderfully adequate for his thoughts, no longer\r\n\r\n      surprised me. It was often necessary to know his thought to understand the\r\n\r\n      terms he used; and it was not easy to penetrate into Rouletabille\u2019s\r\n\r\n      thinking.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This lad\u2019s brain was one of the most curious things I have ever observed.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille went on the even tenor of his way without suspecting the\r\n\r\n      astonishment and even bewilderment he roused in others. I am sure he was\r\n\r\n      not himself in the least conscious of the originality of his genius. He\r\n\r\n      was himself and at ease wherever he happened to be.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When he had finished his recital he asked me what I thought of it. I\r\n\r\n      replied that I was much puzzled by his question. Then he begged me to try,\r\n\r\n      in my turn, to take my reason in hand \u201cby the right end.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seems to me that the point of departure of my\r\n\r\n      reason would be this\u2014there can be no doubt that the murderer you\r\n\r\n      pursued was in the gallery.\u201d I paused.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter making so good a start, you ought not to stop so soon,\u201d he\r\n\r\n      exclaimed. \u201cCome, make another effort.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll try. Since he disappeared from the gallery without passing through\r\n\r\n      any door or window, he must have escaped by some other opening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at me pityingly, smiled carelessly, and remarked that\r\n\r\n      I was reasoning like a postman, or\u2014like Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had alternate fits of admiration and disdain for the great\r\n\r\n      Fred. It all depended as to whether Larsan\u2019s discoveries tallied with\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s reasoning or not. When they did he would exclaim: \u201cHe is\r\n\r\n      really great!\u201d When they did not he would grunt and mutter, \u201cWhat an ass!\u201d\r\n\r\n       It was a petty side of the noble character of this strange youth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We had risen, and he led me into the park. When we reached the court and\r\n\r\n      were making towards the gate, the sound of blinds thrown back against the\r\n\r\n      wall made us turn our heads, and we saw, at a window on the first floor of\r\n\r\n      the chateau, the ruddy and clean shaven face of a person I did not\r\n\r\n      recognise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHullo!\u201d muttered Rouletabille. \u201cArthur Rance!\u201d\u2014He lowered his head,\r\n\r\n      quickened his pace, and I heard him ask himself between his teeth: \u201cWas he\r\n\r\n      in the chateau that night? What is he doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We had gone some distance from the chateau when I asked him who this\r\n\r\n      Arthur Rance was, and how he had come to know him. He referred to his\r\n\r\n      story of that morning and I remembered that Mr. Arthur W. Rance was the\r\n\r\n      American from Philadelphia with whom he had had so many drinks at the\r\n\r\n      Elysee reception.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut was he not to have left France almost immediately?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt; that\u2019s why I am surprised to find him here still, and not only\r\n\r\n      in France, but above all, at the Glandier. He did not arrive this morning;\r\n\r\n      and he did not get here last night. He must have got here before dinner,\r\n\r\n      then. Why didn\u2019t the concierges tell me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I reminded my friend, apropos of the concierges, that he had not yet told\r\n\r\n      me what had led him to get them set at liberty.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were close to their lodge. Monsieur and Madame Bernier saw us coming. A\r\n\r\n      frank smile lit up their happy faces. They seemed to harbour no\r\n\r\n      ill-feeling because of their detention. My young friend asked them at what\r\n\r\n      hour Mr. Arthur Rance had arrived. They answered that they did not know he\r\n\r\n      was at the chateau. He must have come during the evening of the previous\r\n\r\n      night, but they had not had to open the gate for him, because, being a\r\n\r\n      great walker, and not wishing that a carriage should be sent to meet him,\r\n\r\n      he was accustomed to get off at the little hamlet of Saint-Michel, from\r\n\r\n      which he came to the chateau by way of the forest. He reached the park by\r\n\r\n      the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve, over the little gate of which, giving on\r\n\r\n      to the park, he climbed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As the concierges spoke, I saw Rouletabille\u2019s face cloud over and exhibit\r\n\r\n      disappointment\u2014a disappointment, no doubt, with himself. Evidently\r\n\r\n      he was a little vexed, after having worked so much on the spot, with so\r\n\r\n      minute a study of the people and events at the Glandier, that he had to\r\n\r\n      learn now that Arthur Rance was accustomed to visit the chateau.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou say that Monsieur Arthur Rance is accustomed to come to the chateau.\r\n\r\n      When did he come here last?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you exactly,\u201d replied Madame Bernier\u2014that was the\r\n\r\n      name of the concierge\u2014\u201cwe couldn\u2019t know while they were keeping us\r\n\r\n      in prison. Besides, as the gentleman comes to the chateau without passing\r\n\r\n      through our gate he goes away by the way he comes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you know when he came the first time?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh yes, Monsieur!\u2014nine years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe was in France nine years ago, then,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cand, since\r\n\r\n      that time, as far as you know, how many times has he been at the\r\n\r\n      Glandier?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThree times.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen did he come the last time, as far as you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA week before the attempt in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille put another question\u2014this time addressing himself\r\n\r\n      particularly to the woman:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the grove of the parquet?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the grove of the parquet,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThanks!\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cBe ready for me this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He spoke the last words with a finger on his lips as if to command silence\r\n\r\n      and discretion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We left the park and took the way to the Donjon Inn.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you often eat here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut you also take your meals at the chateau?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Larsan and I are sometimes served in one of our rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHasn\u2019t Monsieur Stangerson ever invited you to his own table?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoes your presence at the chateau displease him?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know; but, in any case, he does not make us feel that we are in\r\n\r\n      his way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoesn\u2019t he question you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever. He is in the same state of mind as he was in at the door of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room when his daughter was being murdered, and when he broke open\r\n\r\n      the door and did not find the murderer. He is persuaded, since he could\r\n\r\n      discover nothing, that there\u2019s no reason why we should be able to discover\r\n\r\n      more than he did. But he has made it his duty, since Larsan expressed his\r\n\r\n      theory, not to oppose us.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille buried himself in thought again for some time. He aroused\r\n\r\n      himself later to tell me of how he came to set the two concierges free.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI went recently to see Monsieur Stangerson, and took with me a piece of\r\n\r\n      paper on which was written: \u2018I promise, whatever others may say, to keep\r\n\r\n      in my service my two faithful servants, Bernier and his wife.\u2019 I explained\r\n\r\n      to him that, by signing that document, he would enable me to compel those\r\n\r\n      two people to speak out; and I declared my own assurance of their\r\n\r\n      innocence of any part in the crime. That was also his opinion. The\r\n\r\n      examining magistrate, after it was signed, presented the document to the\r\n\r\n      Berniers, who then did speak. They said, what I was certain they would\r\n\r\n      say, as soon as they were sure they would not lose their place.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey confessed to poaching on Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s estates, and it was\r\n\r\n      while they were poaching, on the night of the crime, that they were found\r\n\r\n      not far from the pavilion at the moment when the outrage was being\r\n\r\n      committed. Some rabbits they caught in that way were sold by them to the\r\n\r\n      landlord of the Donjon Inn, who served them to his customers, or sent them\r\n\r\n      to Paris. That was the truth, as I had guessed from the first. Do you\r\n\r\n      remember what I said, on entering the Donjon Inn?\u2014\u2018We shall have to\r\n\r\n      eat red meat\u2014now!\u2019 I had heard the words on the same morning when we\r\n\r\n      arrived at the park gate. You heard them also, but you did not attach any\r\n\r\n      importance to them. You recollect, when we reached the park gate, that we\r\n\r\n      stopped to look at a man who was running by the side of the wall, looking\r\n\r\n      every minute at his watch. That was Larsan. Well, behind us the landlord\r\n\r\n      of the Donjon Inn, standing on his doorstep, said to someone inside: \u2018We\r\n\r\n      shall have to eat red meat\u2014now.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy that \u2018now\u2019? When you are, as I am, in search of some hidden secret,\r\n\r\n      you can\u2019t afford to have anything escape you. You\u2019ve got to know the\r\n\r\n      meaning of everything. We had come into a rather out-of-the-way part of\r\n\r\n      the country which had been turned topsy-turvey by a crime, and my reason\r\n\r\n      led me to suspect every phrase that could bear upon the event of the day.\r\n\r\n      \u2018Now,\u2019 I took to mean, \u2018since the outrage.\u2019 In the course of my inquiry,\r\n\r\n      therefore, I sought to find a relation between that phrase and the\r\n\r\n      tragedy. We went to the Donjon Inn for breakfast; I repeated the phrase\r\n\r\n      and saw, by the surprise and trouble on Daddy Mathieu\u2019s face, that I had\r\n\r\n      not exaggerated its importance, so far as he was concerned.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI had just learned that the concierges had been arrested. Daddy Mathieu\r\n\r\n      spoke of them as of dear friends\u2014people for whom one is sorry. That\r\n\r\n      was a reckless conjunction of ideas, I said to myself. \u2018Now,\u2019 that the\r\n\r\n      concierges are arrested, \u2018we shall have to eat red meat.\u2019 No more\r\n\r\n      concierges, no more game! The hatred expressed by Daddy Mathieu for\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s forest-keeper\u2014a hatred he pretended was shared\r\n\r\n      by the concierges led me easily to think of poaching. Now as all the\r\n\r\n      evidence showed the concierges had not been in bed at the time of the\r\n\r\n      tragedy, why were they abroad that night? As participants in the crime? I\r\n\r\n      was not disposed to think so. I had already arrived at the conclusion, by\r\n\r\n      steps of which I will tell you later\u2014that the assassin had had no\r\n\r\n      accomplice, and that the tragedy held a mystery between Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and the murderer, a mystery with which the concierges had\r\n\r\n      nothing to do.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith that theory in my mind, I searched for proof in their lodge, which,\r\n\r\n      as you know, I entered. I found there under their bed, some springs and\r\n\r\n      brass wire. \u2018Ah!\u2019 I thought, \u2018these things explain why they were out in\r\n\r\n      the park at night!\u2019 I was not surprised at the dogged silence they\r\n\r\n      maintained before the examining magistrate, even under the accusation so\r\n\r\n      grave as that of being accomplices in the crime. Poaching would save them\r\n\r\n      from the Assize Court, but it would lose them their places; and, as they\r\n\r\n      were perfectly sure of their innocence of the crime they hoped it would\r\n\r\n      soon be established, and then their poaching might go on as usual. They\r\n\r\n      could always confess later. I, however, hastened their confession by means\r\n\r\n      of the document Monsieur Stangerson signed. They gave all the necessary\r\n\r\n      \u2018proofs,\u2019 were set at liberty, and have now a lively gratitude for me. Why\r\n\r\n      did I not get them released sooner? Because I was not sure that nothing\r\n\r\n      more than poaching was against them. I wanted to study the ground. As the\r\n\r\n      days went by, my conviction became more and more certain. The day after\r\n\r\n      the events of the inexplicable gallery I had need of help I could rely on,\r\n\r\n      so I resolved to have them released at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That was how Joseph Rouletabille explained himself. Once more I could not\r\n\r\n      but be astonished at the simplicity of the reasoning which had brought him\r\n\r\n      to the truth of the matter. Certainly this was no big thing; but I think,\r\n\r\n      myself, that the young man will, one of these days, explain with the same\r\n\r\n      simplicity, the fearful tragedy in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d as well as the\r\n\r\n      phenomenon of the inexplicable gallery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We reached the Donjon Inn and entered it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This time we did not see the landlord, but were received with a pleasant\r\n\r\n      smile by the hostess. I have already described the room in which we found\r\n\r\n      ourselves, and I have given a glimpse of the charming blonde woman with\r\n\r\n      the gentle eyes who now immediately began to prepare our breakfast.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow\u2019s Daddy Mathieu?\u201d asked Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot much better\u2014not much better; he is still confined to his bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis rheumatism still sticks to him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. Last night I was again obliged to give him morphine\u2014the only\r\n\r\n      drug that gives him any relief.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She spoke in a soft voice. Everything about her expressed gentleness. She\r\n\r\n      was, indeed, a beautiful woman; somewhat with an air of indolence, with\r\n\r\n      great eyes seemingly black and blue\u2014amorous eyes. Was she happy with\r\n\r\n      her crabbed, rheumatic husband? The scene at which we had once been\r\n\r\n      present did not lead us to believe that she was; yet there was something\r\n\r\n      in her bearing that was not suggestive of despair. She disappeared into\r\n\r\n      the kitchen to prepare our repast, leaving on the table a bottle of\r\n\r\n      excellent cider. Rouletabille filled our earthenware mugs, loaded his\r\n\r\n      pipe, and quietly explained to me his reason for asking me to come to the\r\n\r\n      Glandier with revolvers.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he said, contemplatively looking at the clouds of smoke he was\r\n\r\n      puffing out, \u201cyes, my dear boy, I expect the assassin to-night.\u201d A brief\r\n\r\n      silence followed, which I took care not to interrupt, and then he went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLast night, just as I was going to bed, Monsieur Robert Darzac knocked at\r\n\r\n      my room. When he came in he confided to me that he was compelled to go to\r\n\r\n      Paris the next day, that is, this morning. The reason which made this\r\n\r\n      journey necessary was at once peremptory and mysterious; it was not\r\n\r\n      possible for him to explain its object to me. \u2018I go, and yet,\u2019 he added,\r\n\r\n      \u2018I would give my life not to leave Mademoiselle Stangerson at this\r\n\r\n      moment.\u2019 He did not try to hide that he believed her to be once more in\r\n\r\n      danger. \u2018It will not greatly astonish me if something happens to-morrow\r\n\r\n      night,\u2019 he avowed, \u2018and yet I must be absent. I cannot be back at the\r\n\r\n      Glandier before the morning of the day after to-morrow.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI asked him to explain himself, and this is all he would tell me. His\r\n\r\n      anticipation of coming danger had come to him solely from the coincidence\r\n\r\n      that Mademoiselle Stangerson had been twice attacked, and both times when\r\n\r\n      he had been absent. On the night of the incident of the inexplicable\r\n\r\n      gallery he had been obliged to be away from the Glandier. On the night of\r\n\r\n      the tragedy in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d he had also not been able to be at the\r\n\r\n      Glandier, though this was the first time he had declared himself on the\r\n\r\n      matter. Now a man so moved who would still go away must be acting under\r\n\r\n      compulsion\u2014must be obeying a will stronger than his own. That was\r\n\r\n      how I reasoned, and I told him so. He replied \u2018Perhaps.\u2019\u2014I asked him\r\n\r\n      if Mademoiselle Stangerson was compelling him. He protested that she was\r\n\r\n      not. His determination to go to Paris had been taken without any\r\n\r\n      conference with Mademoiselle Stangerson.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo cut the story short, he repeated that his belief in the possibility of\r\n\r\n      a fresh attack was founded entirely on the extraordinary coincidence. \u2018If\r\n\r\n      anything happens to Mademoiselle Stangerson,\u2019 he said, \u2018it would be\r\n\r\n      terrible for both of us. For her, because her life would be in danger; for\r\n\r\n      me because I could neither defend her from the attack nor tell of where I\r\n\r\n      had been. I am perfectly aware of the suspicions cast on me. The examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate and Monsieur Larsan are both on the point of believing in my\r\n\r\n      guilt. Larsan tracked me the last time I went to Paris, and I had all the\r\n\r\n      trouble in the world to get rid of him.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Why do you not tell me the name of the murderer now, if you know it?\u2019 I\r\n\r\n      cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac appeared extremely troubled by my question, and replied\r\n\r\n      to me in a hesitating tone:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I?\u2014I know the name of the murderer? Why, how could I know his\r\n\r\n      name?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI at once replied: \u2018From Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe grew so pale that I thought he was about to faint, and I saw that I\r\n\r\n      had hit the nail right on the head. Mademoiselle and he knew the name of\r\n\r\n      the murderer! When he recovered himself, he said to me: \u2018I am going to\r\n\r\n      leave you. Since you have been here I have appreciated your exceptional\r\n\r\n      intelligence and your unequalled ingenuity. But I ask this service of you.\r\n\r\n      Perhaps I am wrong to fear an attack during the coming night; but, as I\r\n\r\n      must act with foresight, I count on you to frustrate any attempt that may\r\n\r\n      be made. Take every step needful to protect Mademoiselle Stangerson. Keep\r\n\r\n      a most careful watch of her room. Don\u2019t go to sleep, nor allow yourself\r\n\r\n      one moment of repose. The man we dread is remarkably cunning\u2014with a\r\n\r\n      cunning that has never been equalled. If you keep watch his very cunning\r\n\r\n      may save her; because it\u2019s impossible that he should not know that you are\r\n\r\n      watching; and knowing it, he may not venture.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Have you spoken of all this to Monsieur Stangerson?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No. I do not wish him to ask me, as you just now did, for the name of\r\n\r\n      the murderer. I tell you all this, Monsieur Rouletabille, because I have\r\n\r\n      great, very great, confidence in you. I know that you do not suspect me.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe poor man spoke in jerks. He was evidently suffering. I pitied him,\r\n\r\n      the more because I felt sure that he would rather allow himself to be\r\n\r\n      killed than tell me who the murderer was. As for Mademoiselle Stangerson,\r\n\r\n      I felt that she would rather allow herself to be murdered than denounce\r\n\r\n      the man of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and of the inexplicable gallery. The man must\r\n\r\n      be dominating her, or both, by some inscrutable power. They were dreading\r\n\r\n      nothing so much as the chance of Monsieur Stangerson knowing that his\r\n\r\n      daughter was \u2018held\u2019 by her assailant. I made Monsieur Darzac understand\r\n\r\n      that he had explained himself sufficiently, and that he might refrain from\r\n\r\n      telling me any more than he had already told me. I promised him to watch\r\n\r\n      through the night. He insisted that I should establish an absolutely\r\n\r\n      impassable barrier around Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber, around the\r\n\r\n      boudoir where the nurses were sleeping, and around the drawing-room where,\r\n\r\n      since the affair of the inexplicable gallery, Monsieur Stangerson had\r\n\r\n      slept. In short, I was to put a cordon round the whole apartment.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrom his insistence I gathered that Monsieur Darzac intended not only to\r\n\r\n      make it impossible for the expected man to reach the chamber of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, but to make that impossibility so visibly clear\r\n\r\n      that, seeing himself expected, he would at once go away. That was how I\r\n\r\n      interpreted his final words when we parted: \u2018You may mention your\r\n\r\n      suspicions of the expected attack to Monsieur Stangerson, to Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques, to Frederic Larsan, and to anybody in the chateau.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe poor fellow left me hardly knowing what he was saying. My silence and\r\n\r\n      my eyes told him that I had guessed a large part of his secret. And,\r\n\r\n      indeed, he must have been at his wits\u2019 end, to have come to me at such a\r\n\r\n      time, and to abandon Mademoiselle Stangerson in spite of his fixed idea as\r\n\r\n      to the consequence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen he was gone, I began to think that I should have to use even a\r\n\r\n      greater cunning than his so that if the man should come that night, he\r\n\r\n      might not for a moment suspect that his coming had been expected.\r\n\r\n      Certainly! I would allow him to get in far enough, so that, dead or alive,\r\n\r\n      I might see his face clearly! He must be got rid of. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson must be freed from this continual impending danger.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, my boy,\u201d said Rouletabille, after placing his pipe on the table, and\r\n\r\n      emptying his mug of cider, \u201cI must see his face distinctly, so as to make\r\n\r\n      sure to impress it on that part of my brain where I have drawn my circle\r\n\r\n      of reasoning.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The landlady re-appeared at that moment, bringing in the traditional bacon\r\n\r\n      omelette. Rouletabille chaffed her a little, and she took the chaff with\r\n\r\n      the most charming good humour.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is much jollier when Daddy Mathieu is in bed with his rheumatism,\u201d\r\n\r\n       Rouletabille said to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But I had eyes neither for Rouletabille nor for the landlady\u2019s smiles. I\r\n\r\n      was entirely absorbed over the last words of my young friend and in\r\n\r\n      thinking over Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s strange behaviour.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When he had finished his omelette and we were again alone, Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      continued the tale of his confidences.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I sent you my telegram this morning,\u201d he said, \u201cI had only the word\r\n\r\n      of Monsieur Darzac, that \u2018perhaps\u2019 the assassin would come to-night. I can\r\n\r\n      now say that he will certainly come. I expect him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat has made you feel this certainty?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have been sure since half-past ten o\u2019clock this morning that he would\r\n\r\n      come. I knew that before we saw Arthur Rance at the window in the court.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d I said, \u201cBut, again\u2014what made you so sure? And why since\r\n\r\n      half-past ten this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause, at half-past ten, I had proof that Mademoiselle Stangerson was\r\n\r\n      making as many efforts to permit of the murderer\u2019s entrance as Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac had taken precautions against it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs that possible!\u201d I cried. \u201cHaven\u2019t you told me that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson loves Monsieur Robert Darzac?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI told you so because it is the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen do you see nothing strange\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything in this business is strange, my friend; but take my word for\r\n\r\n      it, the strangeness you now feel is nothing to the strangeness that\u2019s to\r\n\r\n      come!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt must be admitted, then,\u201d I said, \u201cthat Mademoiselle Stangerson and her\r\n\r\n      murderer are in communication\u2014at any rate in writing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAdmit it, my friend, admit it! You don\u2019t risk anything! I told you about\r\n\r\n      the letter left on her table, on the night of the inexplicable gallery\r\n\r\n      affair,\u2014the letter that disappeared into the pocket of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. Why should it not have been a summons to a meeting? Might he\r\n\r\n      not, as soon as he was sure of Darzac\u2019s absence, appoint the meeting for\r\n\r\n      \u2018the coming night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And my friend laughed silently. There are moments when I ask myself if he\r\n\r\n      is not laughing at me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The door of the inn opened. Rouletabille was on his feet so suddenly that\r\n\r\n      one might have thought he had received an electric shock.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMr. Arthur Rance!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mr. Arthur Rance stood before us calmly bowing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XX. An Act of Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou remember me, Monsieur?\u201d asked Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerfectly!\u201d replied Arthur Rance. \u201cI recognise you as the lad at the bar.\r\n\r\n      [The face of Rouletabille crimsoned at being called a \u201clad.\u201d] I want to\r\n\r\n      shake hands with you. You are a bright little fellow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The American extended his hand and Rouletabille, relaxing his frown, shook\r\n\r\n      it and introduced Mr. Arthur Rance to me. He invited him to share our\r\n\r\n      meal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo thanks. I breakfasted with Monsieur Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Arthur Rance spoke French perfectly,\u2014almost without an accent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not expect to have the pleasure of seeing you again, Monsieur. I\r\n\r\n      thought you were to have left France the day after the reception at the\r\n\r\n      Elysee.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and I, outwardly indifferent, listened most intently for\r\n\r\n      every word the American would say.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The man\u2019s purplish red face, his heavy eyelids, the nervous twitchings,\r\n\r\n      all spoke of his addiction to drink. How came it that so sorry a specimen\r\n\r\n      of a man should be so intimate with Monsieur Stangerson?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Some days later, I learned from Frederic Larsan\u2014who, like ourselves,\r\n\r\n      was surprised and mystified by his appearance and reception at the chateau\u2014that\r\n\r\n      Mr. Rance had been an inebriate for only about fifteen years; that is to\r\n\r\n      say, since the professor and his daughter left Philadelphia. During the\r\n\r\n      time the Stangersons lived in America they were very intimate with Arthur\r\n\r\n      Rance, who was one of the most distinguished phrenologists of the new\r\n\r\n      world. Owing to new experiments, he had made enormous strides beyond the\r\n\r\n      science of Gall and Lavater. The friendliness with which he was received\r\n\r\n      at the Glandier may be explained by the fact that he had once rendered\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson a great service by stopping, at the peril of his\r\n\r\n      own life, the runaway horses of her carriage. The immediate result of that\r\n\r\n      could, however, have been no more than a mere friendly association with\r\n\r\n      the Stangersons; certainly, not a love affair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan did not tell me where he had picked up this information;\r\n\r\n      but he appeared to be quite sure of what he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Had we known these facts at the time Arthur Rance met us at the Donjon\r\n\r\n      Inn, his presence at the chateau might not have puzzled us, but they could\r\n\r\n      not have failed to increase our interest in the man himself. The American\r\n\r\n      must have been at least forty-five years old. He spoke in a perfectly\r\n\r\n      natural tone in reply to Rouletabille\u2019s question.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI put off my return to America when I heard of the attack on Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. I wanted to be certain the lady had not been killed, and I\r\n\r\n      shall not go away until she is perfectly recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Arthur Rance then took the lead in talk, paying no heed to some of\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s questions. He gave us, without our inviting him, his\r\n\r\n      personal views on the subject of the tragedy,\u2014views which, as well\r\n\r\n      as I could make out, were not far from those held by Frederic Larzan. The\r\n\r\n      American also thought that Robert Darzac had something to do with the\r\n\r\n      matter. He did not mention him by name, but there was no room to doubt\r\n\r\n      whom he meant. He told us he was aware of the efforts young Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      was making to unravel the tangled skein of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d mystery. He\r\n\r\n      explained that Monsieur Stangerson had related to him all that had taken\r\n\r\n      place in the inexplicable gallery. He several times expressed his regret\r\n\r\n      at Monsieur Darzac\u2019s absence from the chateau on all these occasions, and\r\n\r\n      thought that Monsieur Darzac had done cleverly in allying himself with\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille, who could not fail, sooner or later, to\r\n\r\n      discover the murderer. He spoke the last sentence with unconcealed irony.\r\n\r\n      Then he rose, bowed to us, and left the inn.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille watched him through the window.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn odd fish, that!\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll pass the night at the Glandier?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      To my amazement the young reporter answered that it was a matter of entire\r\n\r\n      indifference to him whether he did or not.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As to how we spent our time during the afternoon, all I need say is that\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille led me to the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve, and, all the time,\r\n\r\n      talked of every subject but the one in which we were most interested.\r\n\r\n      Towards evening I was surprised to find Rouletabille making none of the\r\n\r\n      preparations I had expected him to make. I spoke to him about it when\r\n\r\n      night had come on, and we were once more in his room. He replied that all\r\n\r\n      his arrangements had already been made, and this time the murderer would\r\n\r\n      not get away from him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I expressed some doubt on this, reminding him of his disappearance in the\r\n\r\n      gallery, and suggested that the same phenomenon might occur again. He\r\n\r\n      answered that he hoped it would. He desired nothing more. I did not\r\n\r\n      insist, knowing by experience how useless that would have been. He told me\r\n\r\n      that, with the help of the concierges, the chateau had since early dawn\r\n\r\n      been watched in such a way that nobody could approach it without his\r\n\r\n      knowing it, and that he had no concern for those who might have left it\r\n\r\n      and remained without.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was then six o\u2019clock by his watch. Rising, he made a sign to me to\r\n\r\n      follow him, and, without in the least trying to conceal his movements or\r\n\r\n      the sound of his footsteps, he led me through the gallery. We reached the\r\n\r\n      \u2018right\u2019 gallery and came to the landing-place which we crossed. We then\r\n\r\n      continued our way in the gallery of the left wing, passing Professor\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s apartment.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At the far end of the gallery, before coming to the donjon, is the room\r\n\r\n      occupied by Arthur Rance. We knew that, because we had seen him at the\r\n\r\n      window looking on to the court. The door of the room opens on to the end\r\n\r\n      of the gallery, exactly facing the east window, at the extremity of the\r\n\r\n      \u2018right\u2019 gallery, where Rouletabille had placed Daddy Jacques, and commands\r\n\r\n      an uninterrupted view of the gallery from end to end of the chateau.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cI reserve for myself;\r\n\r\n      when I tell you you\u2019ll come and take your place here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he made me enter a little dark, triangular closet built in a bend of\r\n\r\n      the wall, to the left of the door of Arthur Rance\u2019s room. From this recess\r\n\r\n      I could see all that occurred in the gallery as well as if I had been\r\n\r\n      standing in front of Arthur Rance\u2019s door, and I could watch that door,\r\n\r\n      too. The door of the closet, which was to be my place of observation, was\r\n\r\n      fitted with panels of transparent glass. In the gallery, where all the\r\n\r\n      lamps had been lit, it was quite light. In the closet, however, it was\r\n\r\n      quite dark. It was a splendid place from which to observe and remain\r\n\r\n      unobserved.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was soon to play the part of a spy\u2014a common policeman. I wonder\r\n\r\n      what my leader at the bar would have said had he known! I was not\r\n\r\n      altogether pleased with my duties, but I could not refuse Rouletabille the\r\n\r\n      assistance he had begged me to give him. I took care not to make him see\r\n\r\n      that I in the least objected, and for several reasons. I wanted to oblige\r\n\r\n      him; I did not wish him to think me a coward; I was filled with curiosity;\r\n\r\n      and it was too late for me to draw back, even had I determined to do so.\r\n\r\n      That I had not had these scruples sooner was because my curiosity had\r\n\r\n      quite got the better of me. I might also urge that I was helping to save\r\n\r\n      the life of a woman, and even a lawyer may do that conscientiously.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We returned along the gallery. On reaching the door of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s apartment, it opened from a push given by the steward who was\r\n\r\n      waiting at the dinner-table. (Monsieur Stangerson had, for the last three\r\n\r\n      days, dined with his daughter in the drawing-room on the first floor.) As\r\n\r\n      the door remained open, we distinctly saw Mademoiselle Stangerson, taking\r\n\r\n      advantage of the steward\u2019s absence, and while her father was stooping to\r\n\r\n      pick up something he had let fall, pour the contents of a phial into\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s glass.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXI. On the Watch\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The act, which staggered me, did not appear to affect Rouletabille much.\r\n\r\n      We returned to his room and, without even referring to what we had seen,\r\n\r\n      he gave me his final instructions for the night. First we were to go to\r\n\r\n      dinner; after dinner, I was to take my stand in the dark closet and wait\r\n\r\n      there as long as it was necessary\u2014to look out for what might happen.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you see anything before I do,\u201d he explained, \u201cyou must let me know. If\r\n\r\n      the man gets into the \u2018right\u2019 gallery by any other way than the\r\n\r\n      \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, you will see him before I shall, because you have a\r\n\r\n      view along the whole length of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery, while I can only\r\n\r\n      command a view of the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery. All you need do to let me\r\n\r\n      know is to undo the cord holding the curtain of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery\r\n\r\n      window, nearest to the dark closet. The curtain will fall of itself and\r\n\r\n      immediately leave a square of shadow where previously there had been a\r\n\r\n      square of light. To do this, you need but stretch your hand out of the\r\n\r\n      closet, I shall understand your signal perfectly.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you will see me coming round the corner of the \u2018off-turning\u2019\r\n\r\n      gallery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat am I to do then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will immediately come towards me, behind the man; but I shall already\r\n\r\n      be upon him, and shall have seen his face.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I attempted a feeble smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy do you smile? Well, you may smile while you have the chance, but I\r\n\r\n      swear you\u2019ll have no time for that a few hours from now.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd if the man escapes?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said Rouletabille, coolly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to capture\r\n\r\n      him. He may take himself off any way he can. I will let him go\u2014after\r\n\r\n      I have seen his face. That\u2019s all I want. I shall know afterwards what to\r\n\r\n      do so that as far as Mademoiselle Stangerson is concerned he shall be dead\r\n\r\n      to her even though he continues to live. If I took him alive, Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and Robert Darzac would, perhaps, never forgive me! And I wish\r\n\r\n      to retain their good-will and respect.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSeeing, as I have just now seen, Mademoiselle Stangerson pour a narcotic\r\n\r\n      into her father\u2019s glass, so that he might not be awake to interrupt the\r\n\r\n      conversation she is going to have with her murderer, you can imagine she\r\n\r\n      would not be grateful to me if I brought the man of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and\r\n\r\n      the inexplicable gallery, bound and gagged, to her father. I realise now\r\n\r\n      that if I am to save the unhappy lady, I must silence the man and not\r\n\r\n      capture him. To kill a human being is no small thing. Besides, that\u2019s not\r\n\r\n      my business, unless the man himself makes it my business. On the other\r\n\r\n      hand, to render him forever silent without the lady\u2019s assent and\r\n\r\n      confidence is to act on one\u2019s own initiative and assumes a knowledge of\r\n\r\n      everything with nothing for a basis. Fortunately, my friend, I have\r\n\r\n      guessed, no, I have reasoned it all out. All that I ask of the man who is\r\n\r\n      coming to-night is to bring me his face, so that it may enter\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cInto the circle?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly! And his face won\u2019t surprise me!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I thought you saw his face on the night when you sprang into the\r\n\r\n      chamber?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOnly imperfectly. The candle was on the floor; and, his beard\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWill he wear his beard this evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think I can say for certain that he will. But the gallery is light and,\r\n\r\n      now, I know\u2014or\u2014at least, my brain knows\u2014and my eyes will\r\n\r\n      see.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we are here only to see him and let him escape, why are we armed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause, if the man of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and the inexplicable gallery knows\r\n\r\n      that I know, he is capable of doing anything! We should then have to\r\n\r\n      defend ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you are sure he will come to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs sure as that you are standing there! This morning, at half-past ten\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock, Mademoiselle Stangerson, in the cleverest way in the world,\r\n\r\n      arranged to have no nurses to-night. She gave them leave of absence for\r\n\r\n      twenty-four hours, under some plausible pretexts, and did not desire\r\n\r\n      anybody to be with her but her father, while they are away. Her father,\r\n\r\n      who is to sleep in the boudoir, has gladly consented to the arrangement.\r\n\r\n      Darzac\u2019s departure and what he told me, as well as the extraordinary\r\n\r\n      precautions Mademoiselle Stangerson is taking to be alone to-night leaves\r\n\r\n      me no room for doubt. She has prepared the way for the coming of the man\r\n\r\n      whom Darzac dreads.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s awful!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what we saw her do was done to send her father to sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen there are but two of us for to-night\u2019s work?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFour; the concierge and his wife will watch at all hazards. I don\u2019t set\r\n\r\n      much value on them before\u2014but the concierge may be useful after\u2014if\r\n\r\n      there\u2019s to be any killing!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you think there may be?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf he wishes it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you brought in Daddy Jacques?\u2014Have you made no use of\r\n\r\n      him to-day?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied Rouletabille sharply.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I kept silence for awhile, then, anxious to know his thoughts, I asked him\r\n\r\n      point blank:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy not tell Arthur Rance?\u2014He may be of great assistance to us?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh!\u201d said Rouletabille crossly, \u201cthen you want to let everybody into\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s secrets?\u2014Come, let us go to dinner; it is\r\n\r\n      time. This evening we dine in Frederic Larsan\u2019s room,\u2014at least, if\r\n\r\n      he is not on the heels of Darzac. He sticks to him like a leech. But,\r\n\r\n      anyhow, if he is not there now, I am quite sure he will be, to-night! He\u2019s\r\n\r\n      the one I am going to knock over!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At this moment we heard a noise in the room near us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt must be he,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI forgot to ask you,\u201d I said, \u201cif we are to make any allusion to\r\n\r\n      to-night\u2019s business when we are with this policeman. I take it we are not.\r\n\r\n      Is that so?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently. We are going to operate alone, on our own personal account.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo that all the glory will be ours?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille laughed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We dined with Frederic Larsan in his room. He told us he had just come in\r\n\r\n      and invited us to be seated at table. We ate our dinner in the best of\r\n\r\n      humours, and I had no difficulty in appreciating the feelings of certainty\r\n\r\n      which both Rouletabille and Larsan felt. Rouletabille told the great Fred\r\n\r\n      that I had come on a chance visit, and that he had asked me to stay and\r\n\r\n      help him in the heavy batch of writing he had to get through for the\r\n\r\n      \u201cEpoque.\u201d I was going back to Paris, he said, by the eleven o\u2019clock train,\r\n\r\n      taking his \u201ccopy,\u201d which took a story form, recounting the principal\r\n\r\n      episodes in the mysteries of the Glandier. Larsan smiled at the\r\n\r\n      explanation like a man who was not fooled and politely refrains from\r\n\r\n      making the slightest remark on matters which did not concern him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With infinite precautions as to the words they used, and even as to the\r\n\r\n      tones of their voices, Larsan and Rouletabille discussed, for a long time,\r\n\r\n      Mr. Arthur Rance\u2019s appearance at the chateau, and his past in America,\r\n\r\n      about which they expressed a desire to know more, at any rate, so far as\r\n\r\n      his relations with the Stangersons. At one time, Larsan, who appeared to\r\n\r\n      me to be unwell, said, with an effort:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think, Monsieur Rouletabille, that we\u2019ve not much more to do at the\r\n\r\n      Glandier, and that we sha\u2019n\u2019t sleep here many more nights.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think so, too, Monsieur Fred.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you think the conclusion of the matter has been reached?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think, indeed, that we have nothing more to find out,\u201d replied\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you found your criminal?\u201d asked Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo have I,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan it be the same man?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have swerved from your original idea,\u201d said the young\r\n\r\n      reporter. Then he added, with emphasis: \u201cMonsieur Darzac is an honest\r\n\r\n      man!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you sure of that?\u201d asked Larsan. \u201cWell, I am sure he is not. So it\u2019s\r\n\r\n      a fight then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it is a fight. But I shall beat you, Monsieur Frederic Larsan.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYouth never doubts anything,\u201d said the great Fred laughingly, and held\r\n\r\n      out his hand to me by way of conclusion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s answer came like an echo:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot anything!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly Larsan, who had risen to wish us goodnight, pressed both his\r\n\r\n      hands to his chest and staggered. He was obliged to lean on Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      for support, and to save himself from falling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! Oh!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat is the matter with me?\u2014Have I been\r\n\r\n      poisoned?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He looked at us with haggard eyes. We questioned him vainly; he did not\r\n\r\n      answer us. He had sunk into an armchair and we could get not a word from\r\n\r\n      him. We were extremely distressed, both on his account and on our own, for\r\n\r\n      we had partaken of all the dishes he had eaten. He seemed to be out of\r\n\r\n      pain; but his heavy head had fallen on his shoulder and his eyelids were\r\n\r\n      tightly closed. Rouletabille bent over him, listening for the beatings of\r\n\r\n      the heart.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend\u2019s face, however, when he stood up, was as calm as it had been a\r\n\r\n      moment before agitated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is asleep,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He led me to his chamber, after closing Larsan\u2019s room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe drug?\u201d I asked. \u201cDoes Mademoiselle Stangerson wish to put everybody\r\n\r\n      to sleep, to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps,\u201d replied Rouletabille; but I could see he was thinking of\r\n\r\n      something else.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what about us?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow do we know that we have not been\r\n\r\n      drugged?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you feel indisposed?\u201d Rouletabille asked me coolly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you feel any inclination to go to sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone whatever.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, my friend, smoke this excellent cigar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he handed me a choice Havana, one Monsieur Darzac had given him, while\r\n\r\n      he lit his briarwood\u2014his eternal briarwood.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We remained in his room until about ten o\u2019clock without a word passing\r\n\r\n      between us. Buried in an armchair Rouletabille sat and smoked steadily,\r\n\r\n      his brow in thought and a far-away look in his eyes. On the stroke of ten\r\n\r\n      he took off his boots and signalled to me to do the same. As we stood in\r\n\r\n      our socks he said, in so low a tone that I guessed, rather than heard, the\r\n\r\n      word:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRevolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I drew my revolver from my jacket pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCock it!\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I did as he directed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then moving towards the door of his room, he opened it with infinite\r\n\r\n      precaution; it made no sound. We were in the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille made another sign to me which I understood to mean that I was\r\n\r\n      to take up my post in the dark closet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When I was some distance from him, he rejoined me and embraced me; and\r\n\r\n      then I saw him, with the same precaution, return to his room. Astonished\r\n\r\n      by his embrace, and somewhat disquieted by it, I arrived at the right\r\n\r\n      gallery without difficulty, crossing the landing-place, and reaching the\r\n\r\n      dark closet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Before entering it I examined the curtain-cord of the window and found\r\n\r\n      that I had only to release it from its fastening with my fingers for the\r\n\r\n      curtain to fall by its own weight and hide the square of light from\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2014the signal agreed upon. The sound of a footstep made me\r\n\r\n      halt before Arthur Rance\u2019s door. He was not yet in bed, then! How was it\r\n\r\n      that, being in the chateau, he had not dined with Monsieur Stangerson and\r\n\r\n      his daughter? I had not seen him at table with them, at the moment when we\r\n\r\n      looked in.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I retired into the dark closet. I found myself perfectly situated. I could\r\n\r\n      see along the whole length of the gallery. Nothing, absolutely nothing\r\n\r\n      could pass there without my seeing it. But what was going to pass there?\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s embrace came back to my mind. I argued that people don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      part from each, other in that way unless on an important or dangerous\r\n\r\n      occasion. Was I then in danger?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My hand closed on the butt of my revolver and I waited. I am not a hero;\r\n\r\n      but neither am I a coward.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I waited about an hour, and during all that time I saw nothing unusual.\r\n\r\n      The rain, which had begun to come down strongly towards nine o\u2019clock, had\r\n\r\n      now ceased.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend had told me that, probably, nothing would occur before midnight\r\n\r\n      or one o\u2019clock in the morning. It was not more than half-past eleven,\r\n\r\n      however, when I heard the door of Arthur Rance\u2019s room open very slowly.\r\n\r\n      The door remained open for a minute, which seemed to me a long time. As it\r\n\r\n      opened into the gallery, that is to say, outwards, I could not see what\r\n\r\n      was passing in the room behind the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment I noticed a strange sound, three times repeated, coming\r\n\r\n      from the park. Ordinarily I should not have attached any more importance\r\n\r\n      to it than I would to the noise of cats on the roof. But the third time,\r\n\r\n      the mew was so sharp and penetrating that I remembered what I had heard\r\n\r\n      about the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu. As the cry had accompanied all the\r\n\r\n      events at the Glandier, I could not refrain from shuddering at the\r\n\r\n      thought.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Directly afterwards I saw a man appear on the outside of the door, and\r\n\r\n      close it after him. At first I could not recognise him, for his back was\r\n\r\n      towards me and he was bending over a rather bulky package. When he had\r\n\r\n      closed the door and picked up the package, he turned towards the dark\r\n\r\n      closet, and then I saw who he was. He was the forest-keeper, the Green\r\n\r\n      Man. He was wearing the same costume that he had worn when I first saw him\r\n\r\n      on the road in front of the Donjon Inn. There was no doubt about his being\r\n\r\n      the keeper. As the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu came for the third time, he\r\n\r\n      put down the package and went to the second window, counting from the dark\r\n\r\n      closet. I dared not risk making any movement, fearing I might betray my\r\n\r\n      presence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Arriving at the window, he peered out on to the park. The night was now\r\n\r\n      light, the moon showing at intervals. The Green Man raised his arms twice,\r\n\r\n      making signs which I did not understand; then, leaving the window, he\r\n\r\n      again took up his package and moved along the gallery towards the\r\n\r\n      landing-place.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had instructed me to undo the curtain-cord when I saw\r\n\r\n      anything. Was Rouletabille expecting this? It was not my business to\r\n\r\n      question. All I had to do was obey instructions. I unfastened the\r\n\r\n      window-cord; my heart beating the while as if it would burst. The man\r\n\r\n      reached the landing-place, but, to my utter surprise\u2014I had expected\r\n\r\n      to see him continue to pass along the gallery\u2014I saw him descend the\r\n\r\n      stairs leading to the vestibule.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      What was I to do? I looked stupidly at the heavy curtain which had shut\r\n\r\n      the light from the window. The signal had been given, and I did not see\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille appear at the corner of the off-turning gallery. Nobody\r\n\r\n      appeared. I was exceedingly perplexed. Half an hour passed, an age to me.\r\n\r\n      What was I to do now, even if I saw something? The signal once given I\r\n\r\n      could not give it a second time. To venture into the gallery might upset\r\n\r\n      all Rouletabille\u2019s plans. After all, I had nothing to reproach myself for,\r\n\r\n      and if something had happened that my friend had not expected he could\r\n\r\n      only blame himself. Unable to be of any further assistance to him by means\r\n\r\n      of a signal, I left the dark closet and, still in my socks, made my way to\r\n\r\n      the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      There was no one there. I went to the door of Rouletabille\u2019s room and\r\n\r\n      listened. I could hear nothing. I knocked gently. There was no answer. I\r\n\r\n      turned the door-handle and the door opened. I entered. Rouletabille lay\r\n\r\n      extended at full length on the floor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXII. The Incredible Body\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I bent in great anxiety over the body of the reporter and had the joy to\r\n\r\n      find that he was deeply sleeping, the same unhealthy sleep that I had seen\r\n\r\n      fall upon Frederic Larsan. He had succumbed to the influence of the same\r\n\r\n      drug that had been mixed with our food. How was it then, that I, also, had\r\n\r\n      not been overcome by it? I reflected that the drug must have been put into\r\n\r\n      our wine; because that would explain my condition. I never drink when\r\n\r\n      eating. Naturally inclined to obesity, I am restricted to a dry diet. I\r\n\r\n      shook Rouletabille, but could not succeed in waking him. This, no doubt,\r\n\r\n      was the work of Mademoiselle Stangerson.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She had certainly thought it necessary to guard herself against this young\r\n\r\n      man as well as her father. I recalled that the steward, in serving us, had\r\n\r\n      recommended an excellent Chablis which, no doubt, had come from the\r\n\r\n      professor\u2019s table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      More than a quarter of an hour passed. I resolved, under the pressing\r\n\r\n      circumstances, to resort to extreme measures. I threw a pitcher of cold\r\n\r\n      water over Rouletabille\u2019s head. He opened his eyes. I beat his face, and\r\n\r\n      raised him up. I felt him stiffen in my arms and heard him murmur: \u201cGo on,\r\n\r\n      go on; but don\u2019t make any noise.\u201d I pinched him and shook him until he was\r\n\r\n      able to stand up. We were saved!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey sent me to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAh! I passed an awful quarter of an\r\n\r\n      hour before giving way. But it is over now. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He had no sooner uttered those words than we were thrilled by a frightful\r\n\r\n      cry that rang through the chateau,\u2014a veritable death cry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMalheur!\u201d roared Rouletabille; \u201cwe shall be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He tried to rush to the door, but he was too dazed, and fell against the\r\n\r\n      wall. I was already in the gallery, revolver in hand, rushing like a\r\n\r\n      madman towards Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room. The moment I arrived at the\r\n\r\n      intersection of the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery and the \u201cright\u201d gallery, I saw a\r\n\r\n      figure leaving her apartment, which, in a few strides had reached the\r\n\r\n      landing-place.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was not master of myself. I fired. The report from the revolver made a\r\n\r\n      deafening noise; but the man continued his flight down the stairs. I ran\r\n\r\n      behind him, shouting: \u201cStop!\u2014stop! or I will kill you!\u201d As I rushed\r\n\r\n      after him down the stairs, I came face to face with Arthur Rance coming\r\n\r\n      from the left wing of the chateau, yelling: \u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d We\r\n\r\n      arrived almost at the same time at the foot of the staircase. The window\r\n\r\n      of the vestibule was open. We distinctly saw the form of a man running\r\n\r\n      away. Instinctively we fired our revolvers in his direction. He was not\r\n\r\n      more than ten paces in front of us; he staggered and we thought he was\r\n\r\n      going to fall. We had sprung out of the window, but the man dashed off\r\n\r\n      with renewed vigour. I was in my socks, and the American was barefooted.\r\n\r\n      There being no hope of overtaking him, we fired our last cartridges at\r\n\r\n      him. But he still kept on running, going along the right side of the court\r\n\r\n      towards the end of the right wing of the chateau, which had no other\r\n\r\n      outlet than the door of the little chamber occupied by the forest-keeper.\r\n\r\n      The man, though he was evidently wounded by our bullets, was now twenty\r\n\r\n      yards ahead of us. Suddenly, behind us, and above our heads, a window in\r\n\r\n      the gallery opened and we heard the voice of Rouletabille crying out\r\n\r\n      desperately:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFire, Bernier!\u2014Fire!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment the clear moonlight night was further lit by a broad flash.\r\n\r\n      By its light we saw Daddy Bernier with his gun on the threshold of the\r\n\r\n      donjon door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He had taken good aim. The shadow fell. But as it had reached the end of\r\n\r\n      the right wing of the chateau, it fell on the other side of the angle of\r\n\r\n      the building; that is to say, we saw it about to fall, but not the actual\r\n\r\n      sinking to the ground. Bernier, Arthur Rance and myself reached the other\r\n\r\n      side twenty seconds later. The shadow was lying dead at our feet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Aroused from his lethargy by the cries and reports, Larsan opened the\r\n\r\n      window of his chamber and called out to us. Rouletabille, quite awake now,\r\n\r\n      joined us at the same moment, and I cried out to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is dead!\u2014is dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo much the better,\u201d he said. \u201cTake him into the vestibule of the\r\n\r\n      chateau.\u201d Then as if on second thought, he said: \u201cNo!\u2014no! Let us put\r\n\r\n      him in his own room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille knocked at the door. Nobody answered. Naturally, this did not\r\n\r\n      surprise me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is evidently not there, otherwise he would have come out,\u201d said the\r\n\r\n      reporter. \u201cLet us carry him to the vestibule then.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Since reaching the dead shadow, a thick cloud had covered the moon and\r\n\r\n      darkened the night, so that we were unable to make out the features. Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques, who had now joined us, helped us to carry the body into the\r\n\r\n      vestibule, where we laid it down on the lower step of the stairs. On the\r\n\r\n      way, I had felt my hands wet from the warm blood flowing from the wounds.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques flew to the kitchen and returned with a lantern. He held it\r\n\r\n      close to the face of the dead shadow, and we recognised the keeper, the\r\n\r\n      man called by the landlord of the Donjon Inn the Green Man, whom, an hour\r\n\r\n      earlier, I had seen come out of Arthur Rance\u2019s chamber carrying a parcel.\r\n\r\n      But what I had seen I could only tell Rouletabille later, when we were\r\n\r\n      alone.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and Frederic Larsan experienced a cruel disappointment at the\r\n\r\n      result of the night\u2019s adventure. They could only look in consternation and\r\n\r\n      stupefaction at the body of the Green Man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques showed a stupidly sorrowful face and with silly lamentations\r\n\r\n      kept repeating that we were mistaken\u2014the keeper could not be the\r\n\r\n      assailant. We were obliged to compel him to be quiet. He could not have\r\n\r\n      shown greater grief had the body been that of his own son. I noticed,\r\n\r\n      while all the rest of us were more or less undressed and barefooted, that\r\n\r\n      he was fully clothed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had not left the body. Kneeling on the flagstones by the\r\n\r\n      light of Daddy Jacques\u2019s lantern he removed the clothes from the body and\r\n\r\n      laid bare its breast. Then snatching the lantern from Daddy Jacques, he\r\n\r\n      held it over the corpse and saw a gaping wound. Rising suddenly he\r\n\r\n      exclaimed in a voice filled with savage irony:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man you believe to have been shot was killed by the stab of a knife\r\n\r\n      in his heart!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I thought Rouletabille had gone mad; but, bending over the body, I quickly\r\n\r\n      satisfied myself that Rouletabille was right. Not a sign of a bullet\r\n\r\n      anywhere\u2014the wound, evidently made by a sharp blade, had penetrated\r\n\r\n      the heart.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXIII. The Double Scent\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I had hardly recovered from the surprise into which this new discovery had\r\n\r\n      plunged me, when Rouletabille touched me on the shoulder and asked me to\r\n\r\n      follow him into his room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are we going to do there?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo think the matter over.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I confess I was in no condition for doing much thinking, nor could I\r\n\r\n      understand how Rouletabille could so control himself as to be able calmly\r\n\r\n      to sit down for reflection when he must have known that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was at that moment almost on the point of death. But his\r\n\r\n      self-control was more than I could explain. Closing the door of his room,\r\n\r\n      he motioned me to a chair and, seating himself before me, took out his\r\n\r\n      pipe. We sat there for some time in silence and then I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When I awoke it was daylight. It was eight o\u2019clock by my watch.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was no longer in the room. I rose to go out when the door\r\n\r\n      opened and my friend re-entered. He had evidently lost no time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow about Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d I asked him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHer condition, though very alarming, is not desperate.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen did you leave this room?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTowards dawn.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI guess you have been hard at work?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRather!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you found out anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwo sets of footprints!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo they explain anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave they anything to do with the mystery of the keeper\u2019s body?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; the mystery is no longer a mystery. This morning, walking round the\r\n\r\n      chateau, I found two distinct sets of footprints, made at the same time,\r\n\r\n      last night. They were made by two persons walking side by side. I followed\r\n\r\n      them from the court towards the oak grove. Larsan joined me. They were the\r\n\r\n      same kind of footprints as were made at the time of the assault in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room\u2014one set was from clumsy boots and the other was made by\r\n\r\n      neat ones, except that the big toe of one of the sets was of a different\r\n\r\n      size from the one measured in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d incident. I compared the\r\n\r\n      marks with the paper patterns I had previously made.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill following the tracks of the prints, Larsan and I passed out of the\r\n\r\n      oak grove and reached the border of the lake. There they turned off to a\r\n\r\n      little path leading to the high road to Epinay where we lost the traces in\r\n\r\n      the newly macadamised highway.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe went back to the chateau and parted at the courtyard. We met again,\r\n\r\n      however, in Daddy Jacques\u2019s room to which our separate trains of thinking\r\n\r\n      had led us both. We found the old servant in bed. His clothes on the chair\r\n\r\n      were wet through and his boots very muddy. He certainly did not get into\r\n\r\n      that state in helping us to carry the body of the keeper. It was not\r\n\r\n      raining then. Then his face showed extreme fatigue and he looked at us out\r\n\r\n      of terror-stricken eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn our first questioning him he told us that he had gone to bed\r\n\r\n      immediately after the doctor had arrived. On pressing him, however, for it\r\n\r\n      was evident to us he was not speaking the truth, he confessed that he had\r\n\r\n      been away from the chateau. He explained his absence by saying that he had\r\n\r\n      a headache and went out into the fresh air, but had gone no further than\r\n\r\n      the oak grove. When we then described to him the whole route he had\r\n\r\n      followed, he sat up in bed trembling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And you were not alone!\u2019 cried Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Did you see it then?\u2019 gasped Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The phantom\u2014the black phantom!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen he told us that for several nights he had seen what he kept calling\r\n\r\n      the black phantom. It came into the park at the stroke of midnight and\r\n\r\n      glided stealthily through the trees; it appeared to him to pass through\r\n\r\n      the trunks of the trees. Twice he had seen it from his window, by the\r\n\r\n      light of the moon and had risen and followed the strange apparition. The\r\n\r\n      night before last he had almost overtaken it; but it had vanished at the\r\n\r\n      corner of the donjon. Last night, however, he had not left the chateau,\r\n\r\n      his mind being disturbed by a presentiment that some new crime would be\r\n\r\n      attempted. Suddenly he saw the black phantom rush out from somewhere in\r\n\r\n      the middle of the court. He followed it to the lake and to the high road\r\n\r\n      to Epinay, where the phantom suddenly disappeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Did you see his face?\u2019 demanded Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No!\u2014I saw nothing but black veils.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Did you go out after what passed on the gallery?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I could not!\u2014I was terrified.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Daddy Jacques,\u2019 I said, in a threatening voice, \u2018you did not follow it;\r\n\r\n      you and the phantom walked to Epinay together\u2014arm in arm!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No!\u2019 he cried, turning his eyes away, \u2018I did not. It came on to pour,\r\n\r\n      and\u2014I turned back. I don\u2019t know what became of the black phantom.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe left him, and when we were outside I turned to Larsan, looking him\r\n\r\n      full in the face, and put my question suddenly to take him off his guard:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018An accomplice?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018How can I tell?\u2019 he replied, shrugging his shoulders. \u2018You can\u2019t be sure\r\n\r\n      of anything in a case like this. Twenty-four hours ago I would have sworn\r\n\r\n      that there was no accomplice!\u2019 He left me saying he was off to Epinay.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, what do you make of it?\u201d I asked Rouletabille, after he had ended\r\n\r\n      his recital. \u201cPersonally I am utterly in the dark. I can\u2019t make anything\r\n\r\n      out of it. What do you gather?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything! Everything!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cBut,\u201d he said abruptly, \u201clet\u2019s\r\n\r\n      find out more about Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXIV. Rouletabille Knows the Two Halves of the Murderer\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had been almost murdered for the second time.\r\n\r\n      Unfortunately, she was in too weak a state to bear the severer injuries of\r\n\r\n      this second attack as well as she had those of the first. She had received\r\n\r\n      three wounds in the breast from the murderer\u2019s knife, and she lay long\r\n\r\n      between life and death. Her strong physique, however, saved her; but\r\n\r\n      though she recovered physically it was found that her mind had been\r\n\r\n      affected. The slightest allusion to the terrible incident sent her into\r\n\r\n      delirium, and the arrest of Robert Darzac which followed on the day\r\n\r\n      following the tragic death of the keeper seemed to sink her fine\r\n\r\n      intelligence into complete melancholia.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac arrived at the chateau towards half-past nine. I saw him\r\n\r\n      hurrying through the park, his hair and clothes in disorder and his face a\r\n\r\n      deadly white. Rouletabille and I were looking out of a window in the\r\n\r\n      gallery. He saw us, and gave a despairing cry: \u201cI\u2019m too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille answered: \u201cShe lives!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A minute later Darzac had gone into Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room and,\r\n\r\n      through the door, we could hear his heart-rending sobs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s a fate about this place!\u201d groaned Rouletabille. \u201cSome infernal\r\n\r\n      gods must be watching over the misfortunes of this family!\u2014If I had\r\n\r\n      not been drugged, I should have saved Mademoiselle Stangerson. I should\r\n\r\n      have silenced him forever. And the keeper would not have been killed!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac came in to speak with us. His distress was terrible.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille told him everything: his preparations for Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s safety; his plans for either capturing or for disposing of\r\n\r\n      the assailant for ever; and how he would have succeeded had it not been\r\n\r\n      for the drugging.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf only you had trusted me!\u201d said the young man, in a low tone. \u201cIf you\r\n\r\n      had but begged Mademoiselle Stangerson to confide in me!\u2014But, then,\r\n\r\n      everybody here distrusts everybody else, the daughter distrusts her\r\n\r\n      father, and even her lover. While you ask me to protect her she is doing\r\n\r\n      all she can to frustrate me. That was why I came on the scene too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s request Rouletabille described the whole\r\n\r\n      scene. Leaning on the wall, to prevent himself from falling, he had made\r\n\r\n      his way to Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room, while we were running after the\r\n\r\n      supposed murderer. The ante-room door was open and when he entered he\r\n\r\n      found Mademoiselle Stangerson lying partly thrown over the desk. Her\r\n\r\n      dressing-gown was dyed with the blood flowing from her bosom. Still under\r\n\r\n      the influence of the drug, he felt he was walking in a horrible nightmare.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He went back to the gallery automatically, opened a window, shouted his\r\n\r\n      order to fire, and then returned to the room. He crossed the deserted\r\n\r\n      boudoir, entered the drawing-room, and tried to rouse Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n      who was lying on a sofa. Monsieur Stangerson rose stupidly and let himself\r\n\r\n      be drawn by Rouletabille into the room where, on seeing his daughter\u2019s\r\n\r\n      body, he uttered a heart-rending cry. Both united their feeble strength\r\n\r\n      and carried her to her bed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On his way to join us Rouletabille passed by the desk. On the floor, near\r\n\r\n      it, he saw a large packet. He knelt down and, finding the wrapper loose,\r\n\r\n      he examined it, and made out an enormous quantity of papers and\r\n\r\n      photographs. On one of the papers he read: \u201cNew differential electroscopic\r\n\r\n      condenser. Fundamental properties of substance intermediary between\r\n\r\n      ponderable matter and imponderable ether.\u201d Strange irony of fate that the\r\n\r\n      professor\u2019s precious papers should be restored to him at the very time\r\n\r\n      when an attempt was being made to deprive him of his daughter\u2019s life! What\r\n\r\n      are papers worth to him now?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The morning following that awful night saw Monsieur de Marquet once more\r\n\r\n      at the chateau, with his Registrar and gendarmes. Of course we were all\r\n\r\n      questioned. Rouletabille and I had already agreed on what to say. I kept\r\n\r\n      back any information as to my being in the dark closet and said nothing\r\n\r\n      about the drugging. We did not wish to suggest in any way that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had been expecting her nocturnal visitor. The poor\r\n\r\n      woman might, perhaps, never recover, and it was none of our business to\r\n\r\n      lift the veil of a secret the preservation of which she had paid for so\r\n\r\n      dearly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Arthur Rance told everybody, in a manner so natural that it astonished me,\r\n\r\n      that he had last seen the keeper towards eleven o\u2019clock of that fatal\r\n\r\n      night. He had come for his valise, he said, which he was to take for him\r\n\r\n      early next morning to the Saint-Michel station, and had been kept out late\r\n\r\n      running after poachers. Arthur Rance had, indeed, intended to leave the\r\n\r\n      chateau and, according to his habit, to walk to the station.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson confirmed what Rance had said, adding that he had not\r\n\r\n      asked Rance to dine with him because his friend had taken his final leave\r\n\r\n      of them both earlier in the evening. Monsieur Rance had had tea served him\r\n\r\n      in his room, because he had complained of a slight indisposition.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Bernier testified, instructed by Rouletabille, that the keeper had ordered\r\n\r\n      him to meet at a spot near the oak grove, for the purpose of looking out\r\n\r\n      for poachers. Finding that the keeper did not keep his appointment, he,\r\n\r\n      Bernier, had gone in search of him. He had almost arrived at the donjon,\r\n\r\n      when he saw a figure running swiftly in a direction opposite to him,\r\n\r\n      towards the right wing of the chateau. He heard revolver shots from behind\r\n\r\n      the figure and saw Rouletabille at one of the gallery windows. He heard\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille call out to him to fire, and he had fired. He believed he had\r\n\r\n      killed the man until he learned, after Rouletabille had uncovered the\r\n\r\n      body, that the man had died from a knife thrust. Who had given it he could\r\n\r\n      not imagine. \u201cNobody could have been near the spot without my seeing him.\u201d\r\n\r\n       When the examining magistrate reminded him that the spot where the body\r\n\r\n      was found was very dark and that he himself had not been able to recognise\r\n\r\n      the keeper before firing, Daddy Bernier replied that neither had they seen\r\n\r\n      the other body; nor had they found it. In the narrow court where five\r\n\r\n      people were standing it would have been strange if the other body, had it\r\n\r\n      been there, could have escaped. The only door that opened into the court\r\n\r\n      was that of the keeper\u2019s room, and that door was closed, and the key of it\r\n\r\n      was found in the keeper\u2019s pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      However that might be, the examining magistrate did not pursue his inquiry\r\n\r\n      further in this direction. He was evidently convinced that we had missed\r\n\r\n      the man we were chasing and we had come upon the keeper\u2019s body in our\r\n\r\n      chase. This matter of the keeper was another matter entirely. He wanted to\r\n\r\n      satisfy himself about that without any further delay. Probably it fitted\r\n\r\n      in with the conclusions he had already arrived at as to the keeper and his\r\n\r\n      intrigues with the wife of Mathieu, the landlord of the Donjon Inn. This\r\n\r\n      Mathieu, later in the afternoon, was arrested and taken to Corbeil in\r\n\r\n      spite of his rheumatism. He had been heard to threaten the keeper, and\r\n\r\n      though no evidence against him had been found at his inn, the evidence of\r\n\r\n      carters who had heard the threats was enough to justify his retention.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The examination had proceeded thus far when, to our surprise, Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan returned to the chateau. He was accompanied by one of the employeees\r\n\r\n      of the railway. At that moment Rance and I were in the vestibule\r\n\r\n      discussing Mathieu\u2019s guilt or innocence, while Rouletabille stood apart\r\n\r\n      buried, apparently, in thought. The examining magistrate and his Registrar\r\n\r\n      were in the little green drawing-room, while Darzac was with the doctor\r\n\r\n      and Stangerson in the lady\u2019s chamber. As Frederic Larsan entered the\r\n\r\n      vestibule with the railway employee, Rouletabille and I at once recognised\r\n\r\n      him by the small blond beard. We exchanged meaningful glances. Larsan had\r\n\r\n      himself announced to the examining magistrate by the gendarme and entered\r\n\r\n      with the railway servant as Daddy Jacques came out. Some ten minutes went\r\n\r\n      by during which Rouletabille appeared extremely impatient. The door of the\r\n\r\n      drawing-room was then opened and we heard the magistrate calling to the\r\n\r\n      gendarme who entered. Presently he came out, mounted the stairs and,\r\n\r\n      coming back shortly, went in to the magistrate and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u2014Monsieur Robert Darzac will not come!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! Not come!\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe says he cannot leave Mademoiselle Stangerson in her present state.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet; \u201cthen we\u2019ll go to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet and the gendarme mounted the stairs. He made a sign to\r\n\r\n      Larsan and the railroad employee to follow. Rouletabille and I went along\r\n\r\n      too.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On reaching the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber, Monsieur de\r\n\r\n      Marquet knocked. A chambermaid appeared. It was Sylvia, with her hair all\r\n\r\n      in disorder and consternation showing on her face.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs Monsieur Stangerson within?\u201d asked the magistrate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTell him that I wish to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Stangerson came out. His appearance was wretched in the extreme.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he demanded of the magistrate. \u201cMay I not be left in\r\n\r\n      peace, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the magistrate, \u201cit is absolutely necessary that I should\r\n\r\n      see Monsieur Darzac at once. If you cannot induce him to come, I shall be\r\n\r\n      compelled to use the help of the law.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The professor made no reply. He looked at us all like a man being led to\r\n\r\n      execution, and then went back into the room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Almost immediately after Monsieur Robert Darzac came out. He was very\r\n\r\n      pale. He looked at us and, his eyes falling on the railway servant, his\r\n\r\n      features stiffened and he could hardly repress a groan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were all much moved by the appearance of the man. We felt that what was\r\n\r\n      about to happen would decide the fate of Monsieur Robert Darzac. Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan\u2019s face alone was radiant, showing a joy as of a dog that had at\r\n\r\n      last got its prey.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Pointing to the railway servant, Monsieur de Marquet said to Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Darzac:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you recognise this man, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac, in a tone which he vainly tried to make\r\n\r\n      firm. \u201cHe is an employee at the station at Epinay-sur-Orge.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis young man,\u201d went on Monsieur de Marquet, \u201caffirms that he saw you\r\n\r\n      get off the train at Epinay-sur-Orge\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat night,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac, interrupting, \u201cat half-past ten\u2014it\r\n\r\n      is quite true.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      An interval of silence followed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac,\u201d the magistrate went on in a tone of deep emotion,\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac, what were you doing that night, at Epinay-sur-Orge\u2014at\r\n\r\n      that time?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac remained silent, simply closing his eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac,\u201d insisted Monsieur de Marquet, \u201ccan you tell me how you\r\n\r\n      employeed your time, that night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac opened his eyes. He seemed to have recovered his\r\n\r\n      self-control.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThink, Monsieur! For, if you persist in your strange refusal, I shall be\r\n\r\n      under the painful necessity of keeping you at my disposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI refuse.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac!\u2014in the name of the law, I arrest you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The magistrate had no sooner pronounced the words than I saw Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      move quickly towards Monsieur Darzac. He would certainly have spoken to\r\n\r\n      him, but Darzac, by a gesture, held him off. As the gendarme approached\r\n\r\n      his prisoner, a despairing cry rang through the room:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRobert!\u2014Robert!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We recognised the voice of Mademoiselle Stangerson. We all shuddered.\r\n\r\n      Larsan himself turned pale. Monsieur Darzac, in response to the cry, had\r\n\r\n      flown back into the room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The magistrate, the gendarme, and Larsan followed closely after.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and I remained on the threshold. It was a heart-breaking\r\n\r\n      sight that met our eyes. Mademoiselle Stangerson, with a face of deathly\r\n\r\n      pallor, had risen on her bed, in spite of the restraining efforts of two\r\n\r\n      doctors and her father. She was holding out her trembling arms towards\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac, on whom Larsan and the gendarme had laid hands. Her\r\n\r\n      distended eyes saw\u2014she understood\u2014her lips seemed to form a\r\n\r\n      word, but nobody made it out; and she fell back insensible.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac was hurried out of the room and placed in the vestibule to\r\n\r\n      wait for the vehicle Larsan had gone to fetch. We were all overcome by\r\n\r\n      emotion and even Monsieur de Marquet had tears in his eyes. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      took advantage of the opportunity to say to Monsieur Darzac:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you going to put in any defense?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo!\u201d replied the prisoner.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well, then I will, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou cannot do it,\u201d said the unhappy man with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can\u2014and I will.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s voice had in it a strange strength and confidence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can do it, Monsieur Robert Darzac, because I know more than you do!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome! Come!\u201d murmured Darzac, almost angrily.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave no fear! I shall know only what will benefit you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou must know nothing, young man, if you want me to be grateful.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille shook his head, going close up to Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen to what I am about to say,\u201d he said in a low tone, \u201cand let it\r\n\r\n      give you confidence. You do not know the name of the murderer.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson knows it; but only half of it; but I know his two\r\n\r\n      halves; I know the whole man!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac opened his eyes, with a look that showed he had not\r\n\r\n      understood a word of what Rouletabille had said to him. At that moment the\r\n\r\n      conveyance arrived, driven by Frederic Larsan. Darzac and the gendarme\r\n\r\n      entered it, Larsan remaining on the driver\u2019s seat. The prisoner was taken\r\n\r\n      to Corbeil.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXV. Rouletabille Goes on a Journey\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      That same evening Rouletabille and I left the Glandier. We were very glad\r\n\r\n      to get away and there was nothing more to keep us there. I declared my\r\n\r\n      intention to give up the whole matter. It had been too much for me.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, with a friendly tap on my shoulder, confessed that he had\r\n\r\n      nothing more to learn at the Glandier; he had learned there all it had to\r\n\r\n      tell him. We reached Paris about eight o\u2019clock, dined, and then, tired\r\n\r\n      out, we separated, agreeing to meet the next morning at my rooms.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille arrived next day at the hour agreed on. He was dressed in a\r\n\r\n      suit of English tweed, with an ulster on his arm, and a valise in his\r\n\r\n      hand. Evidently he had prepared himself for a journey.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow long shall you be away?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA month or two,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all depends.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I asked him no more questions.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you know,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat the word was that Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      tried to say before she fainted?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo\u2014nobody heard it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI heard it!\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cShe said \u2018Speak!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think Darzac will speak?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was about to make some further observations, but he wrung my hand warmly\r\n\r\n      and wished me good-bye. I had only time to ask him one question before he\r\n\r\n      left.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you not afraid that other attempts may be made while you\u2019re away?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo! Not now that Darzac is in prison,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With this strange remark he left. I was not to see him again until the day\r\n\r\n      of Darzac\u2019s trial at the court when he appeared to explain the\r\n\r\n      inexplicable.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXVI. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Is Awaited with Impatience\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the 15th of January, that is to say, two months and a half after the\r\n\r\n      tragic events I have narrated, the \u201cEpoque\u201d printed, as the first column\r\n\r\n      of the front page, the following sensational article: \u201cThe Seine-et-Oise\r\n\r\n      jury is summoned to-day to give its verdict on one of the most mysterious\r\n\r\n      affairs in the annals of crime. There never has been a case with so many\r\n\r\n      obscure, incomprehensible, and inexplicable points. And yet the\r\n\r\n      prosecution has not hesitated to put into the prisoner\u2019s dock a man who is\r\n\r\n      respected, esteemed, and loved by all who knew him\u2014a young savant,\r\n\r\n      the hope of French science, whose whole life has been devoted to knowledge\r\n\r\n      and truth. When Paris heard of Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s arrest a unanimous\r\n\r\n      cry of protest arose from all sides. The whole Sorbonne, disgraced by this\r\n\r\n      act of the examining magistrate, asserted its belief in the innocence of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance. Monsieur Stangerson was loud in his\r\n\r\n      denunciation of this miscarriage of justice. There is no doubt in the mind\r\n\r\n      of anybody that could the victim speak she would claim from the jurors of\r\n\r\n      Seine-et-Oise the man she wishes to make her husband and whom the\r\n\r\n      prosecution would send to the scaffold. It is to be hoped that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson will shortly recover her reason, which has been\r\n\r\n      temporarily unhinged by the horrible mystery at the Glandier. The question\r\n\r\n      before the jury is the one we propose to deal with this very day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have decided not to permit twelve worthy men to commit a disgraceful\r\n\r\n      miscarriage of justice. We confess that the remarkable coincidences, the\r\n\r\n      many convicting evidences, and the inexplicable silence on the part of the\r\n\r\n      accused, as well as a total absence of any evidence for an alibi, were\r\n\r\n      enough to warrant the bench of judges in assuming that in this man alone\r\n\r\n      was centered the truth of the affair. The evidences are, in appearance, so\r\n\r\n      overwhelming against Monsieur Robert Darzac that a detective so well\r\n\r\n      informed, so intelligent, and generally so successful, as Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan, may be excused for having been misled by them. Up to now\r\n\r\n      everything has gone against Monsieur Robert Darzac in the magisterial\r\n\r\n      inquiry. To-day, however, we are going to defend him before the jury, and\r\n\r\n      we are going to bring to the witness stand a light that will illumine the\r\n\r\n      whole mystery of the Glandier. For we possess the truth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we have not spoken sooner, it is because the interests of certain\r\n\r\n      parties in the case demand that we should take that course. Our readers\r\n\r\n      may remember the unsigned reports we published relating to the \u2018Left foot\r\n\r\n      of the Rue Oberkampf,\u2019 at the time of the famous robbery of the Credit\r\n\r\n      Universel, and the famous case of the \u2018Gold Ingots of the Mint.\u2019 In both\r\n\r\n      those cases we were able to discover the truth long before even the\r\n\r\n      excellent ingenuity of Frederic Larsan had been able to unravel it. These\r\n\r\n      reports were written by our youngest reporter, Joseph Rouletabille, a\r\n\r\n      youth of eighteen, whose fame to-morrow will be world-wide. When attention\r\n\r\n      was first drawn to the Glandier case, our youthful reporter was on the\r\n\r\n      spot and installed in the chateau, when every other representative of the\r\n\r\n      press had been denied admission. He worked side by side with Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan. He was amazed and terrified at the grave mistake the celebrated\r\n\r\n      detective was about to make, and tried to divert him from the false scent\r\n\r\n      he was following; but the great Fred refused to receive instructions from\r\n\r\n      this young journalist. We know now where it brought Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut now, France must know\u2014the whole world must know, that, on the\r\n\r\n      very evening on which Monsieur Darzac was arrested, young Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      entered our editorial office and informed us that he was about to go away\r\n\r\n      on a journey. \u2018How long I shall be away,\u2019 he said, \u2018I cannot say; perhaps\r\n\r\n      a month\u2014perhaps two\u2014perhaps three\u2014perhaps I may never return.\r\n\r\n      Here is a letter. If I am not back on the day on which Monsieur Darzac is\r\n\r\n      to appear before the Assize Court, have this letter opened and read to the\r\n\r\n      court, after all the witnesses have been heard. Arrange it with Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Darzac\u2019s counsel. Monsieur Darzac is innocent. In this letter is written\r\n\r\n      the name of the murderer; and\u2014that is all I have to say. I am\r\n\r\n      leaving to get my proofs\u2014for the irrefutable evidence of the\r\n\r\n      murderer\u2019s guilt.\u2019 Our reporter departed. For a long time we were without\r\n\r\n      news from him; but, a week ago, a stranger called upon our manager and\r\n\r\n      said: \u2018Act in accordance with the instructions of Joseph Rouletabille, if\r\n\r\n      it becomes necessary to do so. The letter left by him holds the truth.\u2019\r\n\r\n      The gentleman who brought us this message would not give us his name.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo-day, the 15th of January, is the day of the trial. Joseph Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      has not returned. It may be we shall never see him again. The press also\r\n\r\n      counts its heroes, its martyrs to duty. It may be he is no longer living.\r\n\r\n      We shall know how to avenge him. Our manager will, this afternoon, be at\r\n\r\n      the Court of Assize at Versailles, with the letter\u2014the letter\r\n\r\n      containing the name of the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Those Parisians who flocked to the Assize Court at Versailles, to be\r\n\r\n      present at the trial of what was known as the \u201cMystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room,\u201d will certainly remember the terrible crush at the Saint-Lazare\r\n\r\n      station. The ordinary trains were so full that special trains had to be\r\n\r\n      made up. The article in the \u201cEpoque\u201d had so excited the populace that\r\n\r\n      discussion was rife everywhere even to the verge of blows. Partisans of\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille fought with the supporters of Frederic Larsan. Curiously\r\n\r\n      enough the excitement was due less to the fact that an innocent man was in\r\n\r\n      danger of a wrongful conviction than to the interest taken in their own\r\n\r\n      ideas as to the Mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. Each had his explanation to\r\n\r\n      which each held fast. Those who explained the crime on Frederic Larsan\u2019s\r\n\r\n      theory would not admit that there could be any doubt as to the\r\n\r\n      perspicacity of the popular detective. Others who had arrived at a\r\n\r\n      different solution, naturally insisted that this was Rouletabille\u2019s\r\n\r\n      explanation, though they did not as yet know what that was.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With the day\u2019s \u201cEpoque\u201d in their hands, the \u201cLarsans\u201d and the\r\n\r\n      \u201cRouletabilles\u201d fought and shoved each other on the steps of the Palais de\r\n\r\n      Justice, right into the court itself. Those who could not get in remained\r\n\r\n      in the neighbourhood until evening and were, with great difficulty, kept\r\n\r\n      back by the soldiery and the police. They became hungry for news,\r\n\r\n      welcoming the most absurd rumours. At one time the rumour spread that\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson himself had been arrested in the court and had\r\n\r\n      confessed to being the murderer. This goes to show to what a pitch of\r\n\r\n      madness nervous excitement may carry people. Rouletabille was still\r\n\r\n      expected. Some pretended to know him; and when a young man with a \u201cpass\u201d\r\n\r\n       crossed the open space which separated the crowd from the Court House, a\r\n\r\n      scuffle took place. Cries were raised of \u201cRouletabille!\u2014there\u2019s\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille!\u201d The arrival of the manager of the paper was the signal for\r\n\r\n      a great demonstration. Some applauded, others hissed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The trial itself was presided over by Monsieur de Rocouz, a judge filled\r\n\r\n      with the prejudice of his class, but a man honest at heart. The witnesses\r\n\r\n      had been called. I was there, of course, as were all who had, in any way,\r\n\r\n      been in touch with the mysteries of the Glandier. Monsieur Stangerson\u2014looking\r\n\r\n      many years older and almost unrecognisable\u2014Larsan, Arthur Rance,\r\n\r\n      with his face ruddy as ever, Daddy Jacques, Daddy Mathieu, who was brought\r\n\r\n      into court handcuffed between two gendarmes, Madame Mathieu, in tears, the\r\n\r\n      two Berniers, the two nurses, the steward, all the domestics of the\r\n\r\n      chateau, the employee of the Paris Post Office, the railway employee from\r\n\r\n      Epinay, some friends of Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson, and all\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac\u2019s witnesses. I was lucky enough to be called early in the\r\n\r\n      trial, so that I was then able to watch and be present at almost the whole\r\n\r\n      of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The court was so crowded that many lawyers were compelled to find seats on\r\n\r\n      the steps. Behind the bench of justices were representatives from other\r\n\r\n      benches. Monsieur Robert Darzac stood in the prisoner\u2019s dock between\r\n\r\n      policemen, tall, handsome, and calm. A murmur of admiration rather than of\r\n\r\n      compassion greeted his appearance. He leaned forward towards his counsel,\r\n\r\n      Maitre Henri Robert, who, assisted by his chief secretary, Maitre Andre\r\n\r\n      Hesse, was busily turning over the folios of his brief.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Many expected that Monsieur Stangerson, after giving his evidence, would\r\n\r\n      have gone over to the prisoner and shaken hands with him; but he left the\r\n\r\n      court without another word. It was remarked that the jurors appeared to be\r\n\r\n      deeply interested in a rapid conversation which the manager of the\r\n\r\n      \u201cEpoque\u201d was having with Maitre Henri Robert. The manager, later, sat down\r\n\r\n      in the front row of the public seats. Some were surprised that he was not\r\n\r\n      asked to remain with the other witnesses in the room reserved for them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reading of the indictment was got through, as it always is, without\r\n\r\n      any incident. I shall not here report the long examination to which\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac was subjected. He answered all the questions quickly and\r\n\r\n      easily. His silence as to the important matters of which we know was dead\r\n\r\n      against him. It would seem as if this reticence would be fatal for him. He\r\n\r\n      resented the President\u2019s reprimands. He was told that his silence might\r\n\r\n      mean death.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d he said; \u201cI will submit to it; but I am innocent.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      With that splendid ability which has made his fame, Maitre Robert took\r\n\r\n      advantage of the incident, and tried to show that it brought out in noble\r\n\r\n      relief his client\u2019s character; for only heroic natures could remain silent\r\n\r\n      for moral reasons in face of such a danger. The eminent advocate however,\r\n\r\n      only succeeded in assuring those who were already assured of Darzac\u2019s\r\n\r\n      innocence. At the adjournment Rouletabille had not yet arrived. Every time\r\n\r\n      a door opened, all eyes there turned towards it and back to the manager of\r\n\r\n      the \u201cEpoque,\u201d who sat impassive in his place. When he once was feeling in\r\n\r\n      his pocket a loud murmur of expectation followed. The letter!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It is not, however, my intention to report in detail the course of the\r\n\r\n      trial. My readers are sufficiently acquainted with the mysteries\r\n\r\n      surrounding the Glandier case to enable me to go on to the really dramatic\r\n\r\n      denouement of this ever-memorable day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When the trial was resumed, Maitre Henri Robert questioned Daddy Mathieu\r\n\r\n      as to his complicity in the death of the keeper. His wife was also brought\r\n\r\n      in and was confronted by her husband. She burst into tears and confessed\r\n\r\n      that she had been the keeper\u2019s mistress, and that her husband had\r\n\r\n      suspected it. She again, however, affirmed that he had had nothing to do\r\n\r\n      with the murder of her lover. Maitre Henri Robert thereupon asked the\r\n\r\n      court to hear Frederic Larsan on this point.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn a short conversation which I have had with Frederic Larsan, during the\r\n\r\n      adjournment,\u201d declared the advocate, \u201che has made me understand that the\r\n\r\n      death of the keeper may have been brought about otherwise than by the hand\r\n\r\n      of Mathieu. It will be interesting to hear Frederic Larsan\u2019s theory.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan was brought in. His explanation was quite clear.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI see no necessity,\u201d he said, \u201cfor bringing Mathieu in this. I have told\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet that the man\u2019s threats had biassed the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate against him. To me the attempt to murder Mademoiselle and the\r\n\r\n      death of the keeper are the work of one and the same person. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s murderer, flying through the court, was fired on; it was\r\n\r\n      thought he was struck, perhaps killed. As a matter of fact, he only\r\n\r\n      stumbled at the moment of his disappearance behind the corner of the right\r\n\r\n      wing of the chateau. There he encountered the keeper who, no doubt, tried\r\n\r\n      to seize him. The murderer had in his hand the knife with which he had\r\n\r\n      stabbed Mademoiselle Stangerson and with this he killed the keeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      This very simple explanation appeared at once plausible and satisfying. A\r\n\r\n      murmur of approbation was heard.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the murderer? What became of him?\u201d asked the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe was evidently hidden in an obscure corner at the end of the court.\r\n\r\n      After the people had left the court carrying with them the body of the\r\n\r\n      keeper, the murderer quietly made his escape.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The words had scarcely left Larsan\u2019s mouth when from the back of the court\r\n\r\n      came a youthful voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI agree with Frederic Larsan as to the death of the keeper; but I do not\r\n\r\n      agree with him as to the way the murderer escaped!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Everybody turned round, astonished. The clerks of the court sprang towards\r\n\r\n      the speaker, calling out silence, and the President angrily ordered the\r\n\r\n      intruder to be immediately expelled. The same clear voice, however, was\r\n\r\n      again heard:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is I, Monsieur President\u2014Joseph Rouletabille!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXVII. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears in All His Glory\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The excitement was extreme. Cries from fainting women were to be heard\r\n\r\n      amid the extraordinary bustle and stir. The \u201cmajesty of the law\u201d was\r\n\r\n      utterly forgotten. The President tried in vain to make himself heard.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille made his way forward with difficulty, but by dint of much\r\n\r\n      elbowing reached his manager and greeted him cordially. The letter was\r\n\r\n      passed to him and pocketing it he turned to the witness-box. He was\r\n\r\n      dressed exactly as on the day he left me even to the ulster over his arm.\r\n\r\n      Turning to the President, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI beg your pardon, Monsieur President, but I have only just arrived from\r\n\r\n      America. The steamer was late. My name is Joseph Rouletabille!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The silence which followed his stepping into the witness-box was broken by\r\n\r\n      laughter when his words were heard. Everybody seemed relieved and glad to\r\n\r\n      find him there, as if in the expectation of hearing the truth at last.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the President was extremely incensed:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo, you are Joseph Rouletabille,\u201d he replied; \u201cwell, young man, I\u2019ll\r\n\r\n      teach you what comes of making a farce of justice. By virtue of my\r\n\r\n      discretionary power, I hold you at the court\u2019s disposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI ask nothing better, Monsieur President. I have come here for that\r\n\r\n      purpose. I humbly beg the court\u2019s pardon for the disturbance of which I\r\n\r\n      have been the innocent cause. I beg you to believe that nobody has a\r\n\r\n      greater respect for the court than I have. I came in as I could.\u201d He\r\n\r\n      smiled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTake him away!\u201d ordered the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Maitre Henri Robert intervened. He began by apologising for the young man,\r\n\r\n      who, he said, was moved only by the best intentions. He made the President\r\n\r\n      understand that the evidence of a witness who had slept at the Glandier\r\n\r\n      during the whole of that eventful week could not be omitted, and the\r\n\r\n      present witness, moreover, had come to name the real murderer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you going to tell us who the murderer was?\u201d asked the President,\r\n\r\n      somewhat convinced though still sceptical.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have come for that purpose, Monsieur President!\u201d replied Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      An attempt at applause was silenced by the usher.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJoseph Rouletabille,\u201d said Maitre Henri Robert, \u201chas not been regularly\r\n\r\n      subpoenaed as a witness, but I hope, Monsieur President, you will examine\r\n\r\n      him in virtue of your discretionary powers.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well!\u201d said the President, \u201cwe will question him. But we must\r\n\r\n      proceed in order.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Advocate-General rose:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt would, perhaps, be better,\u201d he said, \u201cif the young man were to tell us\r\n\r\n      now whom he suspects.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President nodded ironically:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf the Advocate-General attaches importance to the deposition of Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Joseph Rouletabille, I see no reason why this witness should not give us\r\n\r\n      the name of the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A pin drop could have been heard. Rouletabille stood silent looking\r\n\r\n      sympathetically at Darzac, who, for the first time since the opening of\r\n\r\n      the trial, showed himself agitated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d cried the President, \u201cwe wait for the name of the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n       Rouletabille, feeling in his waistcoat pocket, drew his watch and, looking\r\n\r\n      at it, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur President, I cannot name the murderer before half-past six\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Loud murmurs of disappointment filled the room. Some of the lawyers were\r\n\r\n      heard to say: \u201cHe\u2019s making fun of us!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President in a stern voice, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis joke has gone far enough. You may retire, Monsieur, into the\r\n\r\n      witnesses\u2019 room. I hold you at our disposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille protested.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI assure you, Monsieur President,\u201d he cried in his sharp, clear voice,\r\n\r\n      \u201cthat when I do name the murderer you will understand why I could not\r\n\r\n      speak before half-past six. I assert this on my honour. I can, however,\r\n\r\n      give you now some explanation of the murder of the keeper. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan, who has seen me at work at the Glandier, can tell you\r\n\r\n      with what care I studied this case. I found myself compelled to differ\r\n\r\n      with him in arresting Monsieur Robert Darzac, who is innocent. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Larsan knows of my good faith and knows that some importance may be\r\n\r\n      attached to my discoveries, which have often corroborated his own.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur President, it will be interesting to hear Monsieur Joseph\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, especially as he differs from me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A murmur of approbation greeted the detective\u2019s speech. He was a good\r\n\r\n      sportsman and accepted the challenge. The struggle between the two\r\n\r\n      promised to be exciting.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As the President remained silent, Frederic Larsan continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe agree that the murderer of the keeper was the assailant of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson; but as we are not agreed as to how the murderer\r\n\r\n      escaped, I am curious to hear Monsieur Rouletabille\u2019s explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no doubt you are,\u201d said my friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      General laughter followed this remark. The President angrily declared that\r\n\r\n      if it was repeated, he would have the court cleared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, young man,\u201d said the President, \u201cyou have heard Monsieur Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan; how did the murderer get away from the court?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at Madame Mathieu, who smiled back at him sadly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince Madame Mathieu,\u201d he said, \u201chas freely admitted her intimacy with\r\n\r\n      the keeper\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, it\u2019s the boy!\u201d exclaimed Daddy Mathieu.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRemove that man!\u201d ordered the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mathieu was removed from the court. Rouletabille went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince she has made this confession, I am free to tell you that she often\r\n\r\n      met the keeper at night on the first floor of the donjon, in the room\r\n\r\n      which was once an oratory. These meetings became more frequent when her\r\n\r\n      husband was laid up by his rheumatism. She gave him morphine to ease his\r\n\r\n      pain and to give herself more time for the meetings. Madame Mathieu came\r\n\r\n      to the chateau that night, enveloped in a large black shawl which served\r\n\r\n      also as a disguise. This was the phantom that disturbed Daddy Jacques. She\r\n\r\n      knew how to imitate the mewing of Mother Angenoux\u2019 cat and she would make\r\n\r\n      the cries to advise the keeper of her presence. The recent repairs of the\r\n\r\n      donjon did not interfere with their meetings in the keeper\u2019s old room, in\r\n\r\n      the donjon, since the new room assigned to him at the end of the right\r\n\r\n      wing was separated from the steward\u2019s room by a partition only.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrevious to the tragedy in the courtyard Madame Mathieu and the keeper\r\n\r\n      left the donjon together. I learnt these facts from my examination of the\r\n\r\n      footmarks in the court the next morning. Bernier, the concierge, whom I\r\n\r\n      had stationed behind the donjon\u2014as he will explain himself\u2014could\r\n\r\n      not see what passed in the court. He did not reach the court until he\r\n\r\n      heard the revolver shots, and then he fired. When the woman parted from\r\n\r\n      the man she went towards the open gate of the court, while he returned to\r\n\r\n      his room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe had almost reached the door when the revolvers rang out. He had just\r\n\r\n      reached the corner when a shadow bounded by. Meanwhile, Madame Mathieu,\r\n\r\n      surprised by the revolver shots and by the entrance of people into the\r\n\r\n      court, crouched in the darkness. The court is a large one and, being near\r\n\r\n      the gate, she might easily have passed out unseen. But she remained and\r\n\r\n      saw the body being carried away. In great agony of mind she neared the\r\n\r\n      vestibule and saw the dead body of her lover on the stairs lit up by Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques\u2019 lantern. She then fled; and Daddy Jacques joined her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat same night, before the murder, Daddy Jacques had been awakened by\r\n\r\n      the cat\u2019s cry, and, looking through his window, had seen the black\r\n\r\n      phantom. Hastily dressing himself he went out and recognised her. He is an\r\n\r\n      old friend of Madame Mathieu, and when she saw him she had to tell him of\r\n\r\n      her relations with the keeper and begged his assistance. Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      took pity on her and accompanied her through the oak grove out of the\r\n\r\n      park, past the border of the lake to the road to Epinay. From there it was\r\n\r\n      but a very short distance to her home.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDaddy Jacques returned to the chateau, and, seeing how important it was\r\n\r\n      for Madame Mathieu\u2019s presence at the chateau to remain unknown, he did all\r\n\r\n      he could to hide it. I appeal to Monsieur Larsan, who saw me, next\r\n\r\n      morning, examine the two sets of footprints.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here Rouletabille turning towards Madame Mathieu, with a bow, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe footprints of Madame bear a strange resemblance to the neat\r\n\r\n      footprints of the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Mathieu trembled and looked at him with wide eyes as if in wonder\r\n\r\n      at what he would say next.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame has a shapely foot, long and rather large for a woman. The\r\n\r\n      imprint, with its pointed toe, is very like that of the murderer\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A movement in the court was repressed by Rouletabille. He held their\r\n\r\n      attention at once.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hasten to add,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat I attach no importance to this.\r\n\r\n      Outward signs like these are often liable to lead us into error, if we do\r\n\r\n      not reason rightly. Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s footprints are also like the\r\n\r\n      murderer\u2019s, and yet he is not the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President turning to Madame Mathieu asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs that in accordance with what you know occurred?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur President,\u201d she replied, \u201cit is as if Monsieur Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      had been behind us.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you see the murderer running towards the end of the right wing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, as clearly as I saw them afterwards carrying the keeper\u2019s body.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat became of the murderer?\u2014You were in the courtyard and could\r\n\r\n      easily have seen.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI saw nothing of him, Monsieur President. It became quite dark just\r\n\r\n      then.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d said the President, \u201cmust explain how the\r\n\r\n      murderer made his escape.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was impossible for the murderer to escape by the way he had entered\r\n\r\n      the court without our seeing him; or if we couldn\u2019t see him we must\r\n\r\n      certainly have felt him, since the court is a very narrow one enclosed in\r\n\r\n      high iron railings.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen if the man was hemmed in that narrow square, how is it you did not\r\n\r\n      find him?\u2014I have been asking you that for the last half hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur President,\u201d replied Rouletabille, \u201cI cannot answer that question\r\n\r\n      before half-past six!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      By this time the people in the court-room were beginning to believe in\r\n\r\n      this new witness. They were amused by his melodramatic action in thus\r\n\r\n      fixing the hour; but they seemed to have confidence in the outcome. As for\r\n\r\n      the President, it looked as if he also had made up his mind to take the\r\n\r\n      young man in the same way. He had certainly been impressed by\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s explanation of Madame Mathieu\u2019s part.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d he said, \u201cas you say; but don\u2019t let us see\r\n\r\n      any more of you before half-past six.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille bowed to the President, and made his way to the door of the\r\n\r\n      witnesses\u2019 room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I quietly made my way through the crowd and left the court almost at the\r\n\r\n      same time as Rouletabille. He greeted me heartily, and looked happy.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll not ask you, my dear fellow,\u201d I said, smiling, \u201cwhat you\u2019ve been\r\n\r\n      doing in America; because I\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019ll say you can\u2019t tell me until\r\n\r\n      after half-past six.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, my dear Sainclair, I\u2019ll tell you right now why I went to America. I\r\n\r\n      went in search of the name of the other half of the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe name of the other half?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. When we last left the Glandier I knew there were two halves to\r\n\r\n      the murderer and the name of only one of them. I went to America for the\r\n\r\n      name of the other half.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was too puzzled to answer. Just then we entered the witnesses\u2019 room, and\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was immediately surrounded. He showed himself very friendly\r\n\r\n      to all except Arthur Rance to whom he exhibited a marked coldness of\r\n\r\n      manner. Frederic Larsan came in also. Rouletabille went up and shook him\r\n\r\n      heartily by the hand. His manner toward the detective showed that he had\r\n\r\n      got the better of the policeman. Larsan smiled and asked him what he had\r\n\r\n      been doing in America, Rouletabille began by telling him some anecdotes of\r\n\r\n      his voyage. They then turned aside together apparently with the object of\r\n\r\n      speaking confidentially. I, therefore, discreetly left them and, being\r\n\r\n      curious to hear the evidence, returned to my seat in the court-room where\r\n\r\n      the public plainly showed its lack of interest in what was going on in\r\n\r\n      their impatience for Rouletabille\u2019s return at the appointed time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the stroke of half-past six Joseph Rouletabille was again brought in.\r\n\r\n      It is impossible for me to picture the tense excitement which appeared on\r\n\r\n      every face, as he made his way to the bar. Darzac rose to his feet,\r\n\r\n      frightfully pale.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President, addressing Rouletabille, said gravely:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will not ask you to take the oath, because you have not been regularly\r\n\r\n      summoned; but I trust there is no need to urge upon you the gravity of the\r\n\r\n      statement you are about to make.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked the President quite calmly and steadily in the face,\r\n\r\n      and replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt your last appearance here,\u201d said the President, \u201cwe had arrived at the\r\n\r\n      point where you were to tell us how the murderer escaped, and also his\r\n\r\n      name. Now, Monsieur Rouletabille, we await your explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well, Monsieur,\u201d began my friend amidst a profound silence. \u201cI had\r\n\r\n      explained how it was impossible for the murderer to get away without being\r\n\r\n      seen. And yet he was there with us in the courtyard.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you did not see him? At least that is what the prosecution declares.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo! We all of us saw him, Monsieur le President!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen why was he not arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause no one, besides myself, knew that he was the murderer. It would\r\n\r\n      have spoiled my plans to have had him arrested, and I had then no proof\r\n\r\n      other than my own reasoning. I was convinced we had the murderer before us\r\n\r\n      and that we were actually looking at him. I have now brought what I\r\n\r\n      consider the indisputable proof.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeak out, Monsieur! Tell us the murderer\u2019s name.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will find it on the list of names present in the court on the night\r\n\r\n      of the tragedy,\u201d replied Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The people present in the court-room began showing impatience. Some of\r\n\r\n      them even called for the name, and were silenced by the usher.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe list includes Daddy Jacques, Bernier the concierge, and Mr. Arthur\r\n\r\n      Rance,\u201d said the President. \u201cDo you accuse any of these?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen I do not understand what you are driving at. There was no other\r\n\r\n      person at the end of the court.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur, there was, not at the end, but above the court, who was\r\n\r\n      leaning out of the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you mean Frederic Larsan!\u201d exclaimed the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes! Frederic Larsan!\u201d replied Rouletabille in a ringing tone. \u201cFrederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan is the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The court-room became immediately filled with loud and indignant protests.\r\n\r\n      So astonished was he that the President did not attempt to quiet it. The\r\n\r\n      quick silence which followed was broken by the distinctly whispered words\r\n\r\n      from the lips of Robert Darzac:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s impossible! He\u2019s mad!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou dare to accuse Frederic Larsan, Monsieur?\u201d asked the President. \u201cIf\r\n\r\n      you are not mad, what are your proofs?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cProofs, Monsieur?\u2014Do you want proofs? Well, here is one,\u201d cried\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille shrilly. \u201cLet Frederic Larsan be called!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cUsher, call Frederic Larsan.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The usher hurried to the side door, opened it, and disappeared. The door\r\n\r\n      remained open, while all eyes turned expectantly towards it. The clerk\r\n\r\n      re-appeared and, stepping forward, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur President, Frederic Larsan is not here. He left at about four\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock and has not been seen since.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is my proof!\u201d cried Rouletabille, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExplain yourself?\u201d demanded the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy proof is Larsan\u2019s flight,\u201d said the young reporter. \u201cHe will not come\r\n\r\n      back. You will see no more of Frederic Larsan.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cUnless you are playing with the court, Monsieur, why did you not accuse\r\n\r\n      him when he was present? He would then have answered you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe could give no other answer than the one he has now given by his\r\n\r\n      flight.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe cannot believe that Larsan has fled. There was no reason for his doing\r\n\r\n      so. Did he know you\u2019d make this charge?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe did. I told him I would.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you mean to say that knowing Larsan was the murderer you gave him the\r\n\r\n      opportunity to escape?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur President, I did,\u201d replied Rouletabille, proudly. \u201cI am not\r\n\r\n      a policeman, I am a journalist; and my business is not to arrest people.\r\n\r\n      My business is in the service of truth, and is not that of an executioner.\r\n\r\n      If you are just, Monsieur, you will see that I am right. You can now\r\n\r\n      understand why I refrained until this hour to divulge the name. I gave\r\n\r\n      Larsan time to catch the 4:17 train for Paris, where he would know where\r\n\r\n      to hide himself, and leave no traces. You will not find Frederic Larsan,\u201d\r\n\r\n       declared Rouletabille, fixing his eyes on Monsieur Robert Darzac. \u201cHe is\r\n\r\n      too cunning. He is a man who has always escaped you and whom you have long\r\n\r\n      searched for in vain. If he did not succeed in outwitting me, he can yet\r\n\r\n      easily outwit any police. This man who, four years ago, introduced himself\r\n\r\n      to the Surete, and became celebrated as Frederic Larsan, is notorious\r\n\r\n      under another name\u2014a name well known to crime. Frederic Larsan,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur President, is Ballmeyer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBallmeyer!\u201d cried the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBallmeyer!\u201d exclaimed Robert Darzac, springing to his feet. \u201cBallmeyer!\u2014It\r\n\r\n      was true, then!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! Monsieur Darzac; you don\u2019t think I am mad, now!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ballmeyer! Ballmeyer! No other word could be heard in the courtroom. The\r\n\r\n      President adjourned the hearing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Those of my readers who may not have heard of Ballmeyer will wonder at the\r\n\r\n      excitement the name caused. And yet the doings of this remarkable criminal\r\n\r\n      form the subject-matter of the most dramatic narratives of the newspapers\r\n\r\n      and criminal records of the past twenty years. It had been reported that\r\n\r\n      he was dead, and thus had eluded the police as he had eluded them\r\n\r\n      throughout the whole of his career.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ballmeyer was the best specimen of the high-class \u201cgentleman swindler.\u201d He\r\n\r\n      was adept at sleight of hand tricks, and no bolder or more ruthless crook\r\n\r\n      ever lived. He was received in the best society, and was a member of some\r\n\r\n      of the most exclusive clubs. On many of his depredatory expeditions he had\r\n\r\n      not hesitated to use the knife and the mutton-bone. No difficulty stopped\r\n\r\n      him and no \u201coperation\u201d was too dangerous. He had been caught, but escaped\r\n\r\n      on the very morning of his trial, by throwing pepper into the eyes of the\r\n\r\n      guards who were conducting him to Court. It was known later that, in spite\r\n\r\n      of the keen hunt after him by the most expert of detectives, he had sat\r\n\r\n      that same evening at a first performance in the Theatre Francais, without\r\n\r\n      the slightest disguise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He left France, later, to \u201cwork\u201d America. The police there succeeded in\r\n\r\n      capturing him once, but the extraordinary man escaped the next day. It\r\n\r\n      would need a volume to recount the adventures of this master-criminal. And\r\n\r\n      yet this was the man Rouletabille had allowed to get away! Knowing all\r\n\r\n      about him and who he was, he afforded the criminal an opportunity for\r\n\r\n      another laugh at the society he had defied! I could not help admiring the\r\n\r\n      bold stroke of the young journalist, because I felt certain his motive had\r\n\r\n      been to protect both Mademoiselle Stangerson and rid Darzac of an enemy at\r\n\r\n      the same time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The crowd had barely recovered from the effect of the astonishing\r\n\r\n      revelation when the hearing was resumed. The question in everybody\u2019s mind\r\n\r\n      was: Admitting that Larsan was the murderer, how did he get out of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was immediately called to the bar and his examination\r\n\r\n      continued.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have told us,\u201d said the President, \u201cthat it was impossible to escape\r\n\r\n      from the end of the court. Since Larsan was leaning out of his window, he\r\n\r\n      had left the court. How did he do that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe escaped by a most unusual way. He climbed the wall, sprang onto the\r\n\r\n      terrace, and, while we were engaged with the keeper\u2019s body, reached the\r\n\r\n      gallery by the window. He then had little else to do than to open the\r\n\r\n      window, get in and call out to us, as if he had just come from his own\r\n\r\n      room. To a man of Ballmeyer\u2019s strength all that was mere child\u2019s play. And\r\n\r\n      here, Monsieur, is the proof of what I say.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille drew from his pocket a small packet, from which he produced a\r\n\r\n      strong iron peg.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis, Monsieur,\u201d he said, \u201cis a spike which perfectly fits a hole still\r\n\r\n      to be seen in the cornice supporting the terrace. Larsan, who thought and\r\n\r\n      prepared for everything in case of any emergency, had fixed this spike\r\n\r\n      into the cornice. All he had to do to make his escape good was to plant\r\n\r\n      one foot on a stone which is placed at the corner of the chateau, another\r\n\r\n      on this support, one hand on the cornice of the keeper\u2019s door and the\r\n\r\n      other on the terrace, and Larsan was clear of the ground. The rest was\r\n\r\n      easy. His acting after dinner as if he had been drugged was make believe.\r\n\r\n      He was not drugged; but he did drug me. Of course he had to make it appear\r\n\r\n      as if he also had been drugged so that no suspicion should fall on him for\r\n\r\n      my condition. Had I not been thus overpowered, Larsan would never have\r\n\r\n      entered Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber that night, and the attack on\r\n\r\n      her would not have taken place.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A groan came from Darzac, who appeared to be unable to control his\r\n\r\n      suffering.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou can understand,\u201d added Rouletabille, \u201cthat Larsan would feel himself\r\n\r\n      hampered from the fact that my room was so close to his, and from a\r\n\r\n      suspicion that I would be on the watch that night. Naturally, he could not\r\n\r\n      for a moment believe that I suspected him! But I might see him leaving his\r\n\r\n      room when he was about to go to Mademoiselle Stangerson. He waited till I\r\n\r\n      was asleep, and my friend Sainclair was busy trying to rouse me. Ten\r\n\r\n      minutes after that Mademoiselle was calling out, \u201cMurder!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow did you come to suspect Larsan?\u201d asked the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy pure reason pointed to him. That was why I watched him. But I did not\r\n\r\n      foresee the drugging. He is very cunning. Yes, my pure reason pointed to\r\n\r\n      him; but I required tangible proof so that my eyes could see him as my\r\n\r\n      pure reason saw him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean by your pure reason?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat power of one\u2019s mind which admits of no disturbing elements to a\r\n\r\n      conclusion. The day following the incident of \u2018the inexplicable gallery,\u2019\r\n\r\n      I felt myself losing control of it. I had allowed myself to be diverted by\r\n\r\n      fallacious evidence; but I recovered and again took hold of the right end.\r\n\r\n      I satisfied myself that the murderer could not have left the gallery,\r\n\r\n      either naturally or supernaturally. I narrowed the field of consideration\r\n\r\n      to that small circle, so to speak. The murderer could not be outside that\r\n\r\n      circle. Now who was in it? There was, first, the murderer. Then there were\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques, Monsieur Stangerson, Frederic Larsan, and myself. Five\r\n\r\n      persons in all, counting in the murderer. And yet, in the gallery, there\r\n\r\n      were but four. Now since it had been demonstrated to me that the fifth\r\n\r\n      could not have escaped, it was evident that one of the four present in the\r\n\r\n      gallery must be a double\u2014he must be himself and the murderer also.\r\n\r\n      Why had I not seen this before? Simply because the phenomenon of the\r\n\r\n      double personality had not occurred before in this inquiry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow who of the four persons in the gallery was both that person and the\r\n\r\n      assassin? I went over in my mind what I had seen. I had seen at one and\r\n\r\n      the same time, Monsieur Stangerson and the murderer, Daddy Jacques and the\r\n\r\n      murderer, myself and the murderer; so that the murderer, then, could not\r\n\r\n      be either Monsieur Stangerson, Daddy Jacques, or myself. Had I seen\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan and the murderer at the same time?\u2014No!\u2014Two\r\n\r\n      seconds had passed, during which I lost sight of the murderer; for, as I\r\n\r\n      have noted in my papers, he arrived two seconds before Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, Daddy Jacques, and myself at the meeting-point of the two\r\n\r\n      galleries. That would have given Larsan time to go through the\r\n\r\n      \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, snatch off his false beard, return, and hurry with\r\n\r\n      us as if, like us, in pursuit of the murderer. I was sure now I had got\r\n\r\n      hold of the right end in my reasoning. With Frederic Larsan was now always\r\n\r\n      associated, in my mind, the personality of the unknown of whom I was in\r\n\r\n      pursuit\u2014the murderer, in other words.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat revelation staggered me. I tried to regain my balance by going over\r\n\r\n      the evidences previously traced, but which had diverted my mind and led me\r\n\r\n      away from Frederic Larsan. What were these evidences?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c1st. I had seen the unknown in Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber. On\r\n\r\n      going to Frederic Larsan\u2019s room, I had found Larsan sound asleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c2nd. The ladder.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c3rd. I had placed Frederic Larsan at the end of the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery\r\n\r\n      and had told him that I would rush into Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room to\r\n\r\n      try to capture the murderer. Then I returned to Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber where I had seen the unknown.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe first evidence did not disturb me much. It is likely that, when I\r\n\r\n      descended from my ladder, after having seen the unknown in Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s chamber, Larsan had already finished what he was doing there.\r\n\r\n      Then, while I was re-entering the chateau, Larsan went back to his own\r\n\r\n      room and, undressing himself, went to sleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNor did the second evidence trouble me. If Larsan were the murderer, he\r\n\r\n      could have no use for a ladder; but the ladder might have been placed\r\n\r\n      there to give an appearance to the murderer\u2019s entrance from without the\r\n\r\n      chateau; especially as Larsan had accused Darzac and Darzac was not in the\r\n\r\n      chateau that night. Further, the ladder might have been placed there to\r\n\r\n      facilitate Larsan\u2019s flight in case of absolute necessity.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the third evidence puzzled me altogether. Having placed Larsan at the\r\n\r\n      end of the \u2018off-turning gallery,\u2019 I could not explain how he had taken\r\n\r\n      advantage of the moment when I had gone to the left wing of the chateau to\r\n\r\n      find Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques, to return to Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s room. It was a very dangerous thing to do. He risked being\r\n\r\n      captured,\u2014and he knew it. And he was very nearly captured. He had\r\n\r\n      not had time to regain his post, as he had certainly hoped to do. He had\r\n\r\n      then a very strong reason for returning to his room. As for myself, when I\r\n\r\n      sent Daddy Jacques to the end of the \u2018right gallery,\u2019 I naturally thought\r\n\r\n      that Larsan was still at his post. Daddy Jacques, in going to his post,\r\n\r\n      had not looked, when he passed, to see whether Larsan was at his post or\r\n\r\n      not.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat, then, was the urgent reason which had compelled Larsan to go to the\r\n\r\n      room a second time? I guessed it to be some evidence of his presence\r\n\r\n      there. He had left something very important in that room. What was it? And\r\n\r\n      had he recovered it? I begged Madame Bernier who was accustomed to clean\r\n\r\n      the room to look, and she found a pair of eye-glasses\u2014this pair,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur President!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Rouletabille drew the eye-glasses, of which we know, from his pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I saw these eye-glasses,\u201d he continued, \u201cI was utterly nonplussed. I\r\n\r\n      had never seen Larsan wear eye-glasses. What did they mean? Suddenly I\r\n\r\n      exclaimed to myself: \u2018I wonder if he is long-sighted?\u2019 I had never seen\r\n\r\n      Larsan write. He might, then, be long-sighted. They would certainly know\r\n\r\n      at the Surete, and also know if the glasses were his. Such evidence would\r\n\r\n      be damning. That explained Larsan\u2019s return. I know now that Larsan, or\r\n\r\n      Ballmeyer, is long-sighted and that these glasses belonged to him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI now made one mistake. I was not satisfied with the evidence I had\r\n\r\n      obtained. I wished to see the man\u2019s face. Had I refrained from this, the\r\n\r\n      second terrible attack would not have occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut,\u201d asked the President, \u201cwhy should Larsan go to Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s room, at all? Why should he twice attempt to murder her?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause he loves her, Monsieur President.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is certainly a reason, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is the only reason. He was madly in love, and because of that, and\u2014other\r\n\r\n      things, he was capable of committing any crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid Mademoiselle Stangerson know this?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur; but she was ignorant of the fact that the man who was\r\n\r\n      pursuing her was Frederic Larsan, otherwise, of course, he would not have\r\n\r\n      been allowed to be at the chateau. I noticed, when he was in her room\r\n\r\n      after the incident in the gallery, that he kept himself in the shadow, and\r\n\r\n      that he kept his head bent down. He was looking for the lost eye-glasses.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson knew Larsan under another name.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac,\u201d asked the President, \u201cdid Mademoiselle Stangerson in\r\n\r\n      any way confide in you on this matter? How is it that she has never spoken\r\n\r\n      about it to anyone? If you are innocent, she would have wished to spare\r\n\r\n      you the pain of being accused.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson told me nothing,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoes what this young man says appear probable to you?\u201d the President\r\n\r\n      asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson has told me nothing,\u201d he replied stolidly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you explain that, on the night of the murder of the keeper,\u201d the\r\n\r\n      President asked, turning to Rouletabille, \u201cthe murderer brought back the\r\n\r\n      papers stolen from Monsieur Stangerson?\u2014How do you explain how the\r\n\r\n      murderer gained entrance into Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s locked room?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe last question is easily answered. A man like Larsan, or Ballmeyer,\r\n\r\n      could have had made duplicate keys. As to the documents, I think Larsan\r\n\r\n      had not intended to steal them, at first. Closely watching Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      with the purpose of preventing her marriage with Monsieur Robert Darzac,\r\n\r\n      he one day followed her and Monsieur into the Grands Magasins de la\r\n\r\n      Louvre. There he got possession of the reticule which she lost, or left\r\n\r\n      behind. In that reticule was a key with a brass head. He did not know\r\n\r\n      there was any value attached to the key till the advertisement in the\r\n\r\n      newspapers revealed it. He then wrote to Mademoiselle, as the\r\n\r\n      advertisement requested. No doubt he asked for a meeting, making known to\r\n\r\n      her that he was also the person who had for some time pursued her with his\r\n\r\n      love. He received no answer. He went to the Post Office and ascertained\r\n\r\n      that his letter was no longer there. He had already taken complete stock\r\n\r\n      of Monsieur Darzac, and, having decided to go to any lengths to gain\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had planned that, whatever might happen,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac, his hated rival, should be the man to be suspected.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not think that Larsan had as yet thought of murdering Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson; but whatever he might do, he made sure that Monsieur Darzac\r\n\r\n      should suffer for it. He was very nearly of the same height as Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Darzac and had almost the same sized feet. It would not be difficult, to\r\n\r\n      take an impression of Monsieur Darzac\u2019s footprints, and have similar boots\r\n\r\n      made for himself. Such tricks were mere child\u2019s play for Larsan, or\r\n\r\n      Ballmeyer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cReceiving no reply to his letter, he determined, since Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson would not come to him, that he would go to her. His plan had\r\n\r\n      long been formed. He had made himself master of the plans of the chateau\r\n\r\n      and the pavilion. So that, one afternoon, while Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson were out for a walk, and while Daddy Jacques was away, he\r\n\r\n      entered the latter by the vestibule window. He was alone, and, being in no\r\n\r\n      hurry, he began examining the furniture. One of the pieces, resembling a\r\n\r\n      safe, had a very small keyhole. That interested him! He had with him the\r\n\r\n      little key with the brass head, and, associating one with the other, he\r\n\r\n      tried the key in the lock. The door opened. He saw nothing but papers.\r\n\r\n      They must be very valuable to have been put away in a safe, and the key to\r\n\r\n      which to be of so much importance. Perhaps a thought of blackmail occurred\r\n\r\n      to him as a useful possibility in helping him in his designs on\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson. He quickly made a parcel of the papers and took\r\n\r\n      it to the lavatory in the vestibule. Between the time of his first\r\n\r\n      examination of the pavilion and the night of the murder of the keeper,\r\n\r\n      Larsan had had time to find out what those papers contained. He could do\r\n\r\n      nothing with them, and they were rather compromising. That night he took\r\n\r\n      them back to the chateau. Perhaps he hoped that, by returning the papers\r\n\r\n      he might obtain some gratitude from Mademoiselle Stangerson. But whatever\r\n\r\n      may have been his reasons, he took the papers back and so rid himself of\r\n\r\n      an encumbrance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille coughed. It was evident to me that he was embarrassed. He had\r\n\r\n      arrived at a point where he had to keep back his knowledge of Larsan\u2019s\r\n\r\n      true motive. The explanation he had given had evidently been\r\n\r\n      unsatisfactory. Rouletabille was quick enough to note the bad impression\r\n\r\n      he had made, for, turning to the President, he said: \u201cAnd now we come to\r\n\r\n      the explanation of the Mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A movement of chairs in the court with a rustling of dresses and an\r\n\r\n      energetic whispering of \u201cHush!\u201d showed the curiosity that had been\r\n\r\n      aroused.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems to me,\u201d said the President, \u201cthat the Mystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room, Monsieur Rouletabille, is wholly explained by your hypothesis.\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan is the explanation. We have merely to substitute him for\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac. Evidently the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was open at\r\n\r\n      the time Monsieur Stangerson was alone, and that he allowed the man who\r\n\r\n      was coming out of his daughter\u2019s chamber to pass without arresting him\u2014perhaps\r\n\r\n      at her entreaty to avoid all scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur President,\u201d protested the young man. \u201cYou forget that,\r\n\r\n      stunned by the attack made on her, Mademoiselle Stangerson was not in a\r\n\r\n      condition to have made such an appeal. Nor could she have locked and\r\n\r\n      bolted herself in her room. You must also remember that Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson has sworn that the door was not open.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, however, is the only way in which it can be explained. The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room was as closely shut as an iron safe. To use your own expression, it\r\n\r\n      was impossible for the murderer to make his escape either naturally or\r\n\r\n      supernaturally. When the room was broken into he was not there! He must,\r\n\r\n      therefore, have escaped.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat does not follow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was no need for him to escape\u2014if he was not there!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot there!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently, not. He could not have been there, if he were not found\r\n\r\n      there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, what about the evidences of his presence?\u201d asked the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, Monsieur President, is where we have taken hold of the wrong end.\r\n\r\n      From the time Mademoiselle Stangerson shut herself in the room to the time\r\n\r\n      her door was burst open, it was impossible for the murderer to escape. He\r\n\r\n      was not found because he was not there during that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the evidences?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have led us astray. In reasoning on this mystery we must not take\r\n\r\n      them to mean what they apparently mean. Why do we conclude the murderer\r\n\r\n      was there?\u2014Because he left his tracks in the room? Good! But may he\r\n\r\n      not have been there before the room was locked. Nay, he must have been\r\n\r\n      there before! Let us look into the matter of these traces and see if they\r\n\r\n      do not point to my conclusion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter the publication of the article in the \u2018Matin\u2019 and my conversation\r\n\r\n      with the examining magistrate on the journey from Paris to Epinaysur-Orge,\r\n\r\n      I was certain that \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d had been hermetically sealed, so to\r\n\r\n      speak, and that consequently the murderer had escaped before Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had gone into her chamber at midnight.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt the time I was much puzzled. Mademoiselle Stangerson could not have\r\n\r\n      been her own murderer, since the evidences pointed to some other person.\r\n\r\n      The assassin, then, had come before. If that were so, how was it that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle had been attacked after? or rather, that she appeared to have\r\n\r\n      been attacked after? It was necessary for me to reconstruct the occurrence\r\n\r\n      and make of it two phases\u2014each separated from the other, in time, by\r\n\r\n      the space of several hours. One phase in which Mademoiselle Stangerson had\r\n\r\n      really been attacked\u2014the other phase in which those who heard her\r\n\r\n      cries thought she was being attacked. I had not then examined The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room. What were the marks on Mademoiselle Stangerson? There were marks of\r\n\r\n      strangulation and the wound from a hard blow on the temple. The marks of\r\n\r\n      strangulation did not interest me much; they might have been made before,\r\n\r\n      and Mademoiselle Stangerson could have concealed them by a collarette, or\r\n\r\n      any similar article of apparel. I had to suppose this the moment I was\r\n\r\n      compelled to reconstruct the occurrence by two phases. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had, no doubt, her own reasons for so doing, since she had told\r\n\r\n      her father nothing of it, and had made it understood to the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate that the attack had taken place in the night, during the second\r\n\r\n      phase. She was forced to say that, otherwise her father would have\r\n\r\n      questioned her as to her reason for having said nothing about it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I could not explain the blow on the temple. I understood it even less\r\n\r\n      when I learned that the mutton-bone had been found in her room. She could\r\n\r\n      not hide the fact that she had been struck on the head, and yet that wound\r\n\r\n      appeared evidently to have been inflicted during the first phase, since it\r\n\r\n      required the presence of the murderer! I thought Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      had hidden the wound by arranging her hair in bands on her forehead.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs to the mark of the hand on the wall, that had evidently been made\r\n\r\n      during the first phase\u2014when the murderer was really there. All the\r\n\r\n      traces of his presence had naturally been left during the first phase; the\r\n\r\n      mutton-bone, the black footprints, the Basque cap, the handkerchief, the\r\n\r\n      blood on the wall, on the door, and on the floor. If those traces were\r\n\r\n      still all there, they showed that Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014who\r\n\r\n      desired that nothing should be known\u2014had not yet had time to clear\r\n\r\n      them away. This led me to the conclusion that the two phases had taken\r\n\r\n      place one shortly after the other. She had not had the opportunity, after\r\n\r\n      leaving her room and going back to the laboratory to her father, to get\r\n\r\n      back again to her room and put it in order. Her father was all the time\r\n\r\n      with her, working. So that after the first phase she did not re-enter her\r\n\r\n      chamber till midnight. Daddy Jacques was there at ten o\u2019clock, as he was\r\n\r\n      every night; but he went in merely to close the blinds and light the\r\n\r\n      night-light. Owing to her disturbed state of mind she had forgotten that\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques would go into her room and had begged him not to trouble\r\n\r\n      himself. All this was set forth in the article in the \u2018Matin.\u2019 Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques did go, however, and, in the dim light of the room, saw nothing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson must have lived some anxious moments while Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques was absent; but I think she was not aware that so many evidences\r\n\r\n      had been left. After she had been attacked she had only time to hide the\r\n\r\n      traces of the man\u2019s fingers on her neck and to hurry to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n      Had she known of the bone, the cap, and the handkerchief, she would have\r\n\r\n      made away with them after she had gone back to her chamber at midnight.\r\n\r\n      She did not see them, and undressed by the uncertain glimmer of the night\r\n\r\n      light. She went to bed, worn-out by anxiety and fear\u2014a fear that had\r\n\r\n      made her remain in the laboratory as late as possible.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy reasoning had thus brought me to the second phase of the tragedy, when\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson was alone in the room. I had now to explain the\r\n\r\n      revolver shots fired during the second phase. Cries of \u2018Help!\u2014Murder!\u2019\r\n\r\n      had been heard. How to explain these? As to the cries, I was in no\r\n\r\n      difficulty; since she was alone in her room these could result from\r\n\r\n      nightmare only. My explanation of the struggle and noise that were heard\r\n\r\n      is simply that in her nightmare she was haunted by the terrible experience\r\n\r\n      she had passed through in the afternoon. In her dream she sees the\r\n\r\n      murderer about to spring upon her and she cries, \u2018Help! Murder!\u2019 Her hand\r\n\r\n      wildly seeks the revolver she had placed within her reach on the\r\n\r\n      night-table by the side of her bed, but her hand, striking the table,\r\n\r\n      overturns it, and the revolver, falling to the floor, discharges itself,\r\n\r\n      the bullet lodging in the ceiling. I knew from the first that the bullet\r\n\r\n      in the ceiling must have resulted from an accident. Its very position\r\n\r\n      suggested an accident to my mind, and so fell in with my theory of a\r\n\r\n      nightmare. I no longer doubted that the attack had taken place before\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle had retired for the night. After wakening from her frightful\r\n\r\n      dream and crying aloud for help, she had fainted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy theory, based on the evidence of the shots that were heard at\r\n\r\n      midnight, demanded two shots\u2014one which wounded the murderer at the\r\n\r\n      time of his attack, and one fired at the time of the nightmare. The\r\n\r\n      evidence given by the Berniers before the examining magistrate was to the\r\n\r\n      effect that only one shot had been heard. Monsieur Stangerson testified to\r\n\r\n      hearing a dull sound first followed by a sharp ringing sound. The dull\r\n\r\n      sound I explained by the falling of the marble-topped table; the ringing\r\n\r\n      sound was the shot from the revolver. I was now convinced I was right. The\r\n\r\n      shot that had wounded the hand of the murderer and had caused it to bleed\r\n\r\n      so that he left the bloody imprint on the wall was fired by Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      in self-defence, before the second phase, when she had been really\r\n\r\n      attacked. The shot in the ceiling which the Berniers heard was the\r\n\r\n      accidental shot during the nightmare.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI had now to explain the wound on the temple. It was not severe enough to\r\n\r\n      have been made by means of the mutton-bone, and Mademoiselle had not\r\n\r\n      attempted to hide it. It must have been made during the second phase. It\r\n\r\n      was to find this out that I went to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, and I obtained my\r\n\r\n      answer there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille drew a piece of white folded paper from his pocket, and drew\r\n\r\n      out of it an almost invisible object which he held between his thumb and\r\n\r\n      forefinger.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis, Monsieur President,\u201d he said, \u201cis a hair\u2014a blond hair stained\r\n\r\n      with blood;\u2014it is a hair from the head of Mademoiselle Stangerson. I\r\n\r\n      found it sticking to one of the corners of the overturned table. The\r\n\r\n      corner of the table was itself stained with blood\u2014a tiny stain\u2014hardly\r\n\r\n      visible; but it told me that, on rising from her bed, Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had fallen heavily and had struck her head on the corner of its\r\n\r\n      marble top.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI still had to learn, in addition to the name of the assassin, which I\r\n\r\n      did later, the time of the original attack. I learned this from the\r\n\r\n      examination of Mademoiselle Stangerson and her father, though the answers\r\n\r\n      given by the former were well calculated to deceive the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate\u2014Mademoiselle Stangerson had stated very minutely how she\r\n\r\n      had spent the whole of her time that day. We established the fact that the\r\n\r\n      murderer had introduced himself into the pavilion between five and six\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock. At a quarter past six the professor and his daughter had resumed\r\n\r\n      their work. At five the professor had been with his daughter, and since\r\n\r\n      the attack took place in the professor\u2019s absence from his daughter, I had\r\n\r\n      to find out just when he left her. The professor had stated that at the\r\n\r\n      time when he and his daughter were about to re-enter the laboratory he was\r\n\r\n      met by the keeper and held in conversation about the cutting of some wood\r\n\r\n      and the poachers. Mademoiselle Stangerson was not with him then since the\r\n\r\n      professor said: \u2018I left the keeper and rejoined my daughter who was at\r\n\r\n      work in the laboratory.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was during that short interval of time that the tragedy took place.\r\n\r\n      That is certain. In my mind\u2019s eye I saw Mademoiselle Stangerson re-enter\r\n\r\n      the pavilion, go to her room to take off her hat, and find herself faced\r\n\r\n      by the murderer. He had been in the pavilion for some time waiting for\r\n\r\n      her. He had arranged to pass the whole night there. He had taken off Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques\u2019s boots; he had removed the papers from the cabinet; and had then\r\n\r\n      slipped under the bed. Finding the time long, he had risen, gone again\r\n\r\n      into the laboratory, then into the vestibule, looked into the garden, and\r\n\r\n      had seen, coming towards the pavilion, Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014alone.\r\n\r\n      He would never have dared to attack her at that hour, if he had not found\r\n\r\n      her alone. His mind was made up. He would be more at ease alone with\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson in the pavilion, than he would have been in the\r\n\r\n      middle of the night, with Daddy Jacques sleeping in the attic. So he shut\r\n\r\n      the vestibule window. That explains why neither Monsieur Stangerson, nor\r\n\r\n      the keeper, who were at some distance from the pavilion, had heard the\r\n\r\n      revolver shot.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen he went back to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. Mademoiselle Stangerson came in.\r\n\r\n      What passed must have taken place very quickly. Mademoiselle tried to call\r\n\r\n      for help; but the man had seized her by the throat. Her hand had sought\r\n\r\n      and grasped the revolver which she had been keeping in the drawer of her\r\n\r\n      night-table, since she had come to fear the threats of her pursuer. The\r\n\r\n      murderer was about to strike her on the head with the mutton-bone\u2014a\r\n\r\n      terrible weapon in the hands of a Larsan or Ballmeyer; but she fired in\r\n\r\n      time, and the shot wounded the hand that held the weapon. The bone fell to\r\n\r\n      the floor covered with the blood of the murderer, who staggered, clutched\r\n\r\n      at the wall for support\u2014imprinting on it the red marks\u2014and,\r\n\r\n      fearing another bullet, fled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe saw him pass through the laboratory, and listened. He was long at the\r\n\r\n      window. At length he jumped from it. She flew to it and shut it. The\r\n\r\n      danger past, all her thoughts were of her father. Had he either seen or\r\n\r\n      heard? At any cost to herself she must keep this from him. Thus when\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson returned, he found the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d closed,\r\n\r\n      and his daughter in the laboratory, bending over her desk, at work!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Turning towards Monsieur Darzac, Rouletabille cried: \u201cYou know the truth!\r\n\r\n      Tell us, then, if that is not how things happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI admire you for your silence,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cbut if Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson knew of your danger, she would release you from your oath. She\r\n\r\n      would beg of you to tell all she has confided to you. She would be here to\r\n\r\n      defend you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac made no movement, nor uttered a word. He looked at\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille sadly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHowever,\u201d said the young reporter, \u201csince Mademoiselle is not here, I\r\n\r\n      must do it myself. But, believe me, Monsieur Darzac, the only means to\r\n\r\n      save Mademoiselle Stangerson and restore her to her reason, is to secure\r\n\r\n      your acquittal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is this secret motive that compels Mademoiselle Stangerson to hide\r\n\r\n      her knowledge from her father?\u201d asked the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, Monsieur, I do not know,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cIt is no business of\r\n\r\n      mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President, turning to Monsieur Darzac, endeavoured to induce him to\r\n\r\n      tell what he knew.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you still refuse, Monsieur, to tell us how you employeed your time\r\n\r\n      during the attempts on the life of Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI cannot tell you anything, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President turned to Rouletabille as if appealing for an explanation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must assume, Monsieur President, that Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s\r\n\r\n      absences are closely connected with Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s secret, and\r\n\r\n      that Monsieur Darzac feels himself in honour bound to remain silent. It\r\n\r\n      may be that Larsan, who, since his three attempts, has had everything in\r\n\r\n      training to cast suspicion on Monsieur Darzac, had fixed on just those\r\n\r\n      occasions for a meeting with Monsieur Darzac at a spot most compromising.\r\n\r\n      Larsan is cunning enough to have done that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President seemed partly convinced, but still curious, he asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what is this secret of Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat I cannot tell you,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cI think, however, you know\r\n\r\n      enough now to acquit Monsieur Robert Darzac! Unless Larsan should return,\r\n\r\n      and I don\u2019t think he will,\u201d he added, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOne question more,\u201d said the President. \u201cAdmitting your explanation, we\r\n\r\n      know that Larsan wished to turn suspicion on Monsieur Robert Darzac, but\r\n\r\n      why should he throw suspicion on Daddy Jacques also?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere came in the professional detective, Monsieur, who proves himself an\r\n\r\n      unraveller of mysteries, by annihilating the very proofs he had\r\n\r\n      accumulated. He\u2019s a very cunning man, and a similar trick had often\r\n\r\n      enabled him to turn suspicion from himself. He proved the innocence of one\r\n\r\n      before accusing the other. You can easily believe, Monsieur, that so\r\n\r\n      complicated a scheme as this must have been long and carefully thought out\r\n\r\n      in advance by Larsan. I can tell you that he had long been engaged on its\r\n\r\n      elaboration. If you care to learn how he had gathered information, you\r\n\r\n      will find that he had, on one occasion, disguised himself as the\r\n\r\n      commissionaire between the \u2018Laboratory of the Surete\u2019 and Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, of whom \u2018experiments\u2019 were demanded. In this way he had been\r\n\r\n      able before the crime, on two occasions to take stock of the pavilion. He\r\n\r\n      had \u2018made up\u2019 so that Daddy Jacques had not recognised him. And yet Larsan\r\n\r\n      had found the opportunity to rob the old man of a pair of old boots and a\r\n\r\n      cast-off Basque cap, which the servant had tied up in a handkerchief, with\r\n\r\n      the intention of carrying them to a friend, a charcoal-burner on the road\r\n\r\n      to Epinay. When the crime was discovered, Daddy Jacques had immediately\r\n\r\n      recognised these objects as his. They were extremely compromising, which\r\n\r\n      explains his distress at the time when we spoke to him about them. Larsan\r\n\r\n      confessed it all to me. He is an artist at the game. He did a similar\r\n\r\n      thing in the affair of the \u2018Credit Universel,\u2019 and in that of the \u2018Gold\r\n\r\n      Ingots of the Mint.\u2019 Both these cases should be revised. Since Ballmeyer\r\n\r\n      or Larsan has been in the Surete a number of innocent persons have been\r\n\r\n      sent to prison.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXVIII. In Which It Is Proved That One Does Not Always Think of\r\n\r\n      Everything\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Great excitement prevailed when Rouletabille had finished. The court-room\r\n\r\n      became agitated with the murmurings of suppressed applause. Maitre Henri\r\n\r\n      Robert called for an adjournment of the trial and was supported in his\r\n\r\n      motion by the public prosecutor himself. The case was adjourned. The next\r\n\r\n      day Monsieur Robert Darzac was released on bail, while Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      received the immediate benefit of a \u201cno cause for action.\u201d Search was\r\n\r\n      everywhere made for Frederic Larsan, but in vain. Monsieur Darzac finally\r\n\r\n      escaped the awful calamity which, at one time, had threatened him. After a\r\n\r\n      visit to Mademoiselle Stangerson, he was led to hope that she might, by\r\n\r\n      careful nursing, one day recover her reason.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, naturally, became the \u201cman of the hour.\u201d On leaving the\r\n\r\n      Palais de Justice, the crowd bore him aloft in triumph. The press of the\r\n\r\n      whole world published his exploits and his photograph. He, who had\r\n\r\n      interviewed so many illustrious personages, had himself become illustrious\r\n\r\n      and was interviewed in his turn. I am glad to say that the enormous\r\n\r\n      success in no way turned his head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We left Versailles together, after having dined at \u201cThe Dog That Smokes.\u201d\r\n\r\n       In the train I put a number of questions to him which, during our meal,\r\n\r\n      had been on the tip of my tongue, but which I had refrained from uttering,\r\n\r\n      knowing he did not like to talk \u201cshop\u201d while eating.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy friend,\u201d I said, \u201cthat Larsan case is wonderful. It is worthy of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He begged me to say no more, and humorously pretended an anxiety for me\r\n\r\n      should I give way to silly praise of him because of a personal admiration\r\n\r\n      for his ability.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll come to the point, then,\u201d I said, not a little nettled. \u201cI am still\r\n\r\n      in the dark as to your reason for going to America. When you left the\r\n\r\n      Glandier you had found out, if I rightly understand, all about Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan; you had discovered the exact way he had attempted the murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite so. And you,\u201d he said, turning the conversation, \u201cdid you suspect\r\n\r\n      nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s incredible!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t see how I could have suspected anything. You took great pains to\r\n\r\n      conceal your thoughts from me. Had you already suspected Larsan when you\r\n\r\n      sent for me to bring the revolvers?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes! I had come to that conclusion through the incident of the\r\n\r\n      \u2018inexplicable gallery.\u2019 Larsan\u2019s return to Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room,\r\n\r\n      however, had not then been cleared up by the eye-glasses. My suspicions\r\n\r\n      were the outcome of my reasoning only; and the idea of Larsan being the\r\n\r\n      murderer seemed so extraordinary that I resolved to wait for actual\r\n\r\n      evidence before venturing to act. Nevertheless, the suspicion worried me,\r\n\r\n      and I sometimes spoke to the detective in a way that ought to have opened\r\n\r\n      your eyes. I spoke disparagingly of his methods. But until I found the\r\n\r\n      eye-glasses I could but look upon my suspicion of him in the light of an\r\n\r\n      absurd hypothesis only. You can imagine my elation after I had explained\r\n\r\n      Larsan\u2019s movements. I remember well rushing into my room like a mad-man\r\n\r\n      and crying to you: \u2018I\u2019ll get the better of the great Fred. I\u2019ll get the\r\n\r\n      better of him in a way that will make a sensation!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was then thinking of Larsan, the murderer. It was that same evening\r\n\r\n      that Darzac begged me to watch over Mademoiselle Stangerson. I made no\r\n\r\n      efforts until after we had dined with Larsan, until ten o\u2019clock. He was\r\n\r\n      right there before me, and I could afford to wait. You ought to have\r\n\r\n      suspected, because when we were talking of the murderer\u2019s arrival, I said\r\n\r\n      to you: \u2018I am quite sure Larsan will be here to-night.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut one important point escaped us both. It was one which ought to have\r\n\r\n      opened our eyes to Larsan. Do you remember the bamboo cane? I was\r\n\r\n      surprised to find Larsan had made no use of that evidence against Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac. Had it not been purchased by a man whose description tallied\r\n\r\n      exactly with that of Darzac? Well, just before I saw him off at the train,\r\n\r\n      after the recess during the trial, I asked him why he hadn\u2019t used the cane\r\n\r\n      evidence. He told me he had never had any intention of doing so; that our\r\n\r\n      discovery of it in the little inn at Epinay had much embarrassed him. If\r\n\r\n      you will remember, he told us then that the cane had been given him in\r\n\r\n      London. Why did we not immediately say to ourselves: \u2018Fred is lying. He\r\n\r\n      could not have had this cane in London. He was not in London. He bought it\r\n\r\n      in Paris\u2019? Then you found out, on inquiry at Cassette\u2019s, that the cane had\r\n\r\n      been bought by a person dressed very like Robert Darzac, though, as we\r\n\r\n      learned later, from Darzac himself, it was not he who had made the\r\n\r\n      purchase. Couple this with the fact we already knew, from the letter at\r\n\r\n      the poste restante, that there was actually a man in Paris who was passing\r\n\r\n      as Robert Darzac, why did we not immediately fix on Fred himself?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf course, his position at the Surete was against us; but when we saw the\r\n\r\n      evident eagerness on his part to find convicting evidence against Darzac,\r\n\r\n      nay, even the passion he displayed in his pursuit of the man, the lie\r\n\r\n      about the cane should have had a new meaning for us. If you ask why Larsan\r\n\r\n      bought the cane, if he had no intention of manufacturing evidence against\r\n\r\n      Darzac by means of it, the answer is quite simple. He had been wounded in\r\n\r\n      the hand by Mademoiselle Stangerson, so that the cane was useful to enable\r\n\r\n      him to close his hand in carrying it. You remember I noticed that he\r\n\r\n      always carried it?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll these details came back to my mind when I had once fixed on Larsan as\r\n\r\n      the criminal. But they were too late then to be of any use to me. On the\r\n\r\n      evening when he pretended to be drugged I looked at his hand and saw a\r\n\r\n      thin silk bandage covering the signs of a slight healing wound. Had we\r\n\r\n      taken a quicker initiative at the time Larsan told us that lie about the\r\n\r\n      cane, I am certain he would have gone off, to avoid suspicion. All the\r\n\r\n      same, we worried Larsan or Ballmeyer without our knowing it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cif Larsan had no intention of using the cane as\r\n\r\n      evidence against Darzac, why had he made himself up to look like the man\r\n\r\n      when he went in to buy it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe had not specially \u2018made up\u2019 as Darzac to buy the cane; he had come\r\n\r\n      straight to Cassette\u2019s immediately after he had attacked Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. His wound was troubling him and, as he was passing along the\r\n\r\n      Avenue de l\u2019Opera, the idea of the cane came to his mind and he acted on\r\n\r\n      it. It was then eight o\u2019clock. And I, who had hit upon the very hour of\r\n\r\n      the occurrence of the tragedy, almost convinced that Darzac was not the\r\n\r\n      criminal, and knowing of the cane, I still never suspected Larsan. There\r\n\r\n      are times...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are times,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen the greatest intellects\u2014...\u201d\r\n\r\n       Rouletabille shut my mouth. I still continued to chide him, but, finding\r\n\r\n      he did not reply, I saw he was no longer paying any attention to what I\r\n\r\n      was saying. I found he was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXIX. The Mystery of Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      During the days that followed I had several opportunities to question him\r\n\r\n      as to his reason for his voyage to America, but I obtained no more precise\r\n\r\n      answers than he had given me on the evening of the adjournment of the\r\n\r\n      trial, when we were on the train for Paris. One day, however, on my still\r\n\r\n      pressing him, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan\u2019t you understand that I had to know Larsan\u2019s true personality?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt,\u201d I said, \u201cbut why did you go to America to find that out?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He sat smoking his pipe, and made no further reply. I began to see that I\r\n\r\n      was touching on the secret that concerned Mademoiselle Stangerson.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille evidently had found it necessary to go to America to find out\r\n\r\n      what the mysterious tie was that bound her to Larsan by so strange and\r\n\r\n      terrible a bond. In America he had learned who Larsan was and had obtained\r\n\r\n      information which closed his mouth. He had been to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And now, what was this mystery which held Mademoiselle Stangerson and\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac in so inexplicable a silence? After so many years\r\n\r\n      and the publicity given the case by a curious and shameless press; now\r\n\r\n      that Monsieur Stangerson knows all and has forgiven all, all may be told.\r\n\r\n      In every phase of this remarkable story Mademoiselle Stangerson had always\r\n\r\n      been the sufferer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The beginning dates from the time when, as a young girl, she was living\r\n\r\n      with her father in Philadelphia. A visitor at the house, a Frenchman, had\r\n\r\n      succeeded by his wit, grace and persistent attention, in gaining her\r\n\r\n      affections. He was said to be rich and had asked her of her father.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson, on making inquiries as to Monsieur Jean Roussel,\r\n\r\n      found that the man was a swindler and an adventurer. Jean Roussel was but\r\n\r\n      another of the many names under which the notorious Ballmeyer, a fugitive\r\n\r\n      from France, tried to hide himself. Monsieur Stangerson did not know of\r\n\r\n      his identity with Ballmeyer; he learned that the man was simply\r\n\r\n      undesirable for his daughter. He not only refused to give his consent to\r\n\r\n      the marriage but denied him admission into the house. Mathilde Stangerson,\r\n\r\n      however, had fallen in love. To her Jean Roussel was everything that her\r\n\r\n      love painted him. She was indignant at her father\u2019s attitude, and did not\r\n\r\n      conceal her feelings. Her father sent her to stay with an aunt in\r\n\r\n      Cincinnati. There she was joined by Jean Roussel and, in spite of the\r\n\r\n      reverence she felt for her father, ran away with him to get married.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They went to Louisville and lived there for some time. One morning,\r\n\r\n      however, a knock came at the door of the house in which they were and the\r\n\r\n      police entered to arrest Jean Roussel. It was then that Mathilde\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, or Roussel, learned that her husband was no other than the\r\n\r\n      notorious Ballmeyer!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The young woman in her despair tried to commit suicide. She failed in\r\n\r\n      this, and was forced to rejoin her aunt in Cincinnati, The old lady was\r\n\r\n      overjoyed to see her again. She had been anxiously searching for her and\r\n\r\n      had not dared to tell Monsieur Stangerson of her disappearance. Mathilde\r\n\r\n      swore her to secrecy, so that her father should not know she had been\r\n\r\n      away. A month later, Mademoiselle Stangerson returned to her father,\r\n\r\n      repentant, her heart dead within her, hoping only one thing: that she\r\n\r\n      would never again see her husband, the horrible Ballmeyer. A report was\r\n\r\n      spread, a few weeks later, that he was dead, and she now determined to\r\n\r\n      atone for her disobedience by a life of labour and devotion for her\r\n\r\n      father. And she kept her word.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      All this she had confessed to Robert Darzac, and, believing Ballmeyer\r\n\r\n      dead, had given herself to the joy of a union with him. But fate had\r\n\r\n      resuscitated Jean Roussel\u2014the Ballmeyer of her youth. He had taken\r\n\r\n      steps to let her know that he would never allow her to marry Darzac\u2014that\r\n\r\n      he still loved her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson never for one moment hesitated to confide in\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac. She showed him the letter in which Jean Roussel asked her\r\n\r\n      to recall the first hours of their union in their beautiful and charming\r\n\r\n      Louisville home. \u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the\r\n\r\n      garden its brightness,\u201d he had written. The scoundrel pretended to be rich\r\n\r\n      and claimed the right of taking her back to Louisville. She had told\r\n\r\n      Darzac that if her father should know of her dishonour, she would kill\r\n\r\n      herself. Monsieur Darzac had sworn to silence her persecutor, even if he\r\n\r\n      had to kill him. He was outwitted and would have succumbed had it not been\r\n\r\n      for the genius of Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson was herself helpless in the hands of such a\r\n\r\n      villain. She had tried to kill him when he had first threatened and then\r\n\r\n      attacked her in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. She had, unfortunately, failed, and felt\r\n\r\n      herself condemned to be for ever at the mercy of this unscrupulous wretch\r\n\r\n      who was continually demanding her presence at clandestine interviews. When\r\n\r\n      he sent her the letter through the Post Office, asking her to meet him,\r\n\r\n      she had refused. The result of her refusal was the tragedy of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room. The second time he wrote asking for a meeting, the letter reaching\r\n\r\n      her in her sick chamber, she had avoided him by sleeping with her\r\n\r\n      servants. In that letter the scoundrel had warned her that, since she was\r\n\r\n      too ill to come to him, he would come to her, and that he would be in her\r\n\r\n      chamber at a particular hour on a particular night. Knowing that she had\r\n\r\n      everything to fear from Ballmeyer, she had left her chamber on that night.\r\n\r\n      It was then that the incident of the \u201cinexplicable gallery\u201d occurred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The third time she had determined to keep the appointment. He asked for it\r\n\r\n      in the letter he had written in her own room, on the night of the incident\r\n\r\n      in the gallery, which he left on her desk. In that letter he threatened to\r\n\r\n      burn her father\u2019s papers if she did not meet him. It was to rescue these\r\n\r\n      papers that she made up her mind to see him. She did not for one moment\r\n\r\n      doubt that the wretch would carry out his threat if she persisted in\r\n\r\n      avoiding him, and in that case the labours of her father\u2019s lifetime would\r\n\r\n      be for ever lost. Since the meeting was thus inevitable, she resolved to\r\n\r\n      see her husband and appeal to his better nature. It was for this interview\r\n\r\n      that she had prepared herself on the night the keeper was killed. They did\r\n\r\n      meet, and what passed between them may be imagined. He insisted that she\r\n\r\n      renounce Darzac. She, on her part, affirmed her love for him. He stabbed\r\n\r\n      her in his anger, determined to convict Darzac of the crime. As Larsan he\r\n\r\n      could do it, and had so managed things that Darzac could never explain how\r\n\r\n      he had employeed the time of his absence from the chateau. Ballmeyer\u2019s\r\n\r\n      precautions were most cunningly taken.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Larsan had threatened Darzac as he had threatened Mathilde\u2014with the\r\n\r\n      same weapon, and the same threats. He wrote Darzac urgent letters,\r\n\r\n      declaring himself ready to deliver up the letters that had passed between\r\n\r\n      him and his wife, and to leave them for ever, if he would pay him his\r\n\r\n      price. He asked Darzac to meet him for the purpose of arranging the\r\n\r\n      matter, appointing the time when Larsan would be with Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. When Darzac went to Epinay, expecting to find Ballmeyer or\r\n\r\n      Larsan there, he was met by an accomplice of Larsan\u2019s, and kept waiting\r\n\r\n      until such time as the \u201ccoincidence\u201d could be established.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was all done with Machiavellian cunning; but Ballmeyer had reckoned\r\n\r\n      without Joseph Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Now that the Mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d has been cleared up, this is not\r\n\r\n      the time to tell of Rouletabille\u2019s adventures in America. Knowing the\r\n\r\n      young reporter as we do, we can understand with what acumen he had traced,\r\n\r\n      step by step, the story of Mathilde Stangerson and Jean Roussel. At\r\n\r\n      Philadelphia he had quickly informed himself as to Arthur William Rance.\r\n\r\n      There he learned of Rance\u2019s act of devotion and the reward he thought\r\n\r\n      himself entitled to for it. A rumour of his marriage with Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had once found its way into the drawing-rooms of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n      He also learned of Rance\u2019s continued attentions to her and his\r\n\r\n      importunities for her hand. He had taken to drink, he had said, to drown\r\n\r\n      his grief at his unrequited love. It can now be understood why\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had shown so marked a coolness of demeanour towards Rance\r\n\r\n      when they met in the witnesses\u2019 room, on the day of the trial.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The strange Roussel-Stangerson mystery had now been laid bare. Who was\r\n\r\n      this Jean Roussel? Rouletabille had traced him from Philadelphia to\r\n\r\n      Cincinnati. In Cincinnati he became acquainted with the old aunt, and had\r\n\r\n      found means to open her mouth. The story of Ballmeyer\u2019s arrest threw the\r\n\r\n      right light on the whole story. He visited the \u201cpresbytery\u201d\u2014a small\r\n\r\n      and pretty dwelling in the old colonial style\u2014which had, indeed,\r\n\r\n      \u201clost nothing of its charm.\u201d Then, abandoning his pursuit of traces of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, he took up those of Ballmeyer. He followed them\r\n\r\n      from prison to prison, from crime to crime. Finally, as he was about\r\n\r\n      leaving for Europe, he learned in New York that Ballmeyer had, five years\r\n\r\n      before, embarked for France with some valuable papers belonging to a\r\n\r\n      merchant of New Orleans whom he had murdered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And yet the whole of this mystery has not been revealed. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had a child, by her husband,\u2014a son. The infant was born\r\n\r\n      in the old aunt\u2019s house. No one knew of it, so well had the aunt managed\r\n\r\n      to conceal the event.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      What became of that son?\u2014That is another story which, so far, I am\r\n\r\n      not permitted to relate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      About two months after these events, I came upon Rouletabille sitting on a\r\n\r\n      bench in the Palais de Justice, looking very depressed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, old man?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou are looking very downcast.\r\n\r\n      How are your friends getting on?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cApart from you,\u201d he said, \u201cI have no friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope that Monsieur Darzac\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014How is she?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBetter\u2014much better.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you ought not to be sad.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sad,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I am thinking of the perfume of the lady in\r\n\r\n      black\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe perfume of the lady in black!\u2014I have heard you often refer to\r\n\r\n      it. Tell me why it troubles you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps\u2014some day; some day,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he heaved a profound sigh.

GAYETY AND DYNAMITE\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBARINIA, the young stranger has arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, he is waiting at the lodge.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI told you to show him to Natacha\u2019s sitting-room. Didn\u2019t you understand\r\n\r\n      me, Ermolai?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon, Barinia, but the young stranger, when I asked to search him, as\r\n\r\n      you directed, flatly refused to let me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you explain to him that everybody is searched before being allowed to\r\n\r\n      enter, that it is the order, and that even my mother herself has submitted\r\n\r\n      to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI told him all that, Barinia; and I told him about madame your mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat did he say to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat he was not madame your mother. He acted angry.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, let him come in without being searched.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Chief of Police won\u2019t like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo as I say.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai bowed and returned to the garden. The \u201cbarinia\u201d left the veranda,\r\n\r\n      where she had come for this conversation with the old servant of General\r\n\r\n      Trebassof, her husband, and returned to the dining-room in the datcha des\r\n\r\n      Iles, where the gay Councilor Ivan Petrovitch was regaling his amused\r\n\r\n      associates with his latest exploit at Cubat\u2019s resort. They were a noisy\r\n\r\n      company, and certainly the quietest among them was not the general, who\r\n\r\n      nursed on a sofa the leg which still held him captive after the recent\r\n\r\n      attack, that to his old coachman and his two piebald horses had proved\r\n\r\n      fatal. The story of the always-amiable Ivan Petrovitch (a lively, little,\r\n\r\n      elderly man with his head bald as an egg) was about the evening before.\r\n\r\n      After having, as he said, \u201crecure la bouche\u201d for these gentlemen spoke\r\n\r\n      French like their own language and used it among themselves to keep their\r\n\r\n      servants from understanding\u2014after having wet his whistle with a\r\n\r\n      large glass of sparkling rosy French wine, he cried:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou would have laughed, Feodor Feodorovitch. We had sung songs on the\r\n\r\n      Barque* and then the Bohemians left with their music and we went out onto\r\n\r\n      the river-bank to stretch our legs and cool our faces in the freshness of\r\n\r\n      the dawn, when a company of Cossacks of the Guard came along. I knew the\r\n\r\n      officer in command and invited him to come along with us and drink the\r\n\r\n      Emperor\u2019s health at Cubat\u2019s place. That officer, Feodor Feodorovitch, is a\r\n\r\n      man who knows vintages and boasts that he has never swallowed a glass of\r\n\r\n      anything so common as Crimean wine. When I named champagne he cried, \u2018Vive\r\n\r\n      l\u2019Empereur!\u2019 A true patriot. So we started, merry as school-children. The\r\n\r\n      entire company followed, then all the diners playing little whistles, and\r\n\r\n      all the servants besides, single file. At Cubat\u2019s I hated to leave the\r\n\r\n      companion-officers of my friend at the door, so I invited them in, too.\r\n\r\n      They accepted, naturally. But the subalterns were thirsty as well. I\r\n\r\n      understand discipline. You know, Feodor Feodorovitch, that I am a stickler\r\n\r\n      for discipline. Just because one is gay of a spring morning, discipline\r\n\r\n      should not be forgotten. I invited the officers to drink in a private\r\n\r\n      room, and sent the subalterns into the main hall of the restaurant. Then\r\n\r\n      the soldiers were thirsty, too, and I had drinks served to them out in the\r\n\r\n      courtyard. Then, my word, there was a perplexing business, for now the\r\n\r\n      horses whinnied. The brave horses, Feodor Feodorovitch, who also wished to\r\n\r\n      drink the health of the Emperor. I was bothered about the discipline.\r\n\r\n      Hall, court, all were full. And I could not put the horses in private\r\n\r\n      rooms. Well, I made them carry out champagne in pails and then came the\r\n\r\n      perplexing business I had tried so hard to avoid, a grand mixture of boots\r\n\r\n      and horse-shoes that was certainly the liveliest thing I have ever seen in\r\n\r\n      my life. But the horses were the most joyous, and danced as if a torch was\r\n\r\n      held under their nostrils, and all of them, my word! were ready to throw\r\n\r\n      their riders because the men were not of the same mind with them as to the\r\n\r\n      route to follow! From our window we laughed fit to kill at such a mixture\r\n\r\n      of sprawling boots and dancing hoofs. But the troopers finally got all\r\n\r\n      their horses to barracks, with patience, for the Emperor\u2019s cavalry are the\r\n\r\n      best riders in the world, Feodor Feodorovitch. And we certainly had a\r\n\r\n      great laugh!\u2014Your health, Matrena Petrovna.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      These last graceful words were addressed to Madame Trebassof, who shrugged\r\n\r\n      her shoulders at the undesired gallantry of the gay Councilor. She did not\r\n\r\n      join in the conversation, excepting to calm the general, who wished to\r\n\r\n      send the whole regiment to the guard-house, men and horses. And while the\r\n\r\n      roisterers laughed over the adventure she said to her husband in the\r\n\r\n      advisory voice of the helpful wife:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFeodor, you must not attach importance to what that old fool Ivan tells\r\n\r\n      you. He is the most imaginative man in the capital when he has had\r\n\r\n      champagne.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIvan, you certainly have not had horses served with champagne in pails,\u201d\r\n\r\n       the old boaster, Athanase Georgevitch, protested jealously. He was an\r\n\r\n      advocate, well-known for his table-feats, who claimed the hardest drinking\r\n\r\n      reputation of any man in the capital, and he regretted not to have\r\n\r\n      invented that tale.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn my word! And the best brands! I had won four thousand roubles. I left\r\n\r\n      the little fete with fifteen kopecks.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna was listening to Ermolai, the faithful country servant\r\n\r\n      who wore always, even here in the city, his habit of fresh nankeen, his\r\n\r\n      black leather belt, his large blue pantaloons and his boots glistening\r\n\r\n      like ice, his country costume in his master\u2019s city home. Madame Matrena\r\n\r\n      rose, after lightly stroking the hair of her step-daughter Natacha, whose\r\n\r\n      eyes followed her to the door, indifferent apparently to the tender\r\n\r\n      manifestations of her father\u2019s orderly, the soldier-poet, Boris Mourazoff,\r\n\r\n      who had written beautiful verses on the death of the Moscow students,\r\n\r\n      after having shot them, in the way of duty, on their barricades.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai conducted his mistress to the drawing-room and pointed across to a\r\n\r\n      door that he had left open, which led to the sitting-room before Natacha\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is there,\u201d said Ermolai in a low voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai need have said nothing, for that matter, since Madame Matrena was\r\n\r\n      aware of a stranger\u2019s presence in the sitting-room by the extraordinary\r\n\r\n      attitude of an individual in a maroon frock-coat bordered with false\r\n\r\n      astrakhan, such as is on the coats of all the Russian police agents and\r\n\r\n      makes the secret agents recognizable at first glance. This policeman was\r\n\r\n      on his knees in the drawing-room watching what passed in the next room\r\n\r\n      through the narrow space of light in the hinge-way of the door. In this\r\n\r\n      manner, or some other, all persons who wished to approach General\r\n\r\n      Trebassof were kept under observation without their knowing it, after\r\n\r\n      having been first searched at the lodge, a measure adopted since the\r\n\r\n      latest attack.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Matrena touched the policeman\u2019s shoulder with that heroic hand\r\n\r\n      which had saved her husband\u2019s life and which still bore traces of the\r\n\r\n      terrible explosion in the last attack, when she had seized the infernal\r\n\r\n      machine intended for the general with her bare hand. The policeman rose\r\n\r\n      and silently left the room, reached the veranda and lounged there on a\r\n\r\n      sofa, pretending to be asleep, but in reality watching the garden paths.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna took his place at the hinge-vent. This was her rule; she\r\n\r\n      always took the final glance at everything and everybody. She roved at all\r\n\r\n      hours of the day and night round about the general, like a watch-dog,\r\n\r\n      ready to bite, to throw itself before the danger, to receive the blows, to\r\n\r\n      perish for its master. This had commenced at Moscow after the terrible\r\n\r\n      repression, the massacre of revolutionaries under the walls of Presnia,\r\n\r\n      when the surviving Nihilists left behind them a placard condemning the\r\n\r\n      victorious General Trebassof to death. Matrena Petrovna lived only for the\r\n\r\n      general. She had vowed that she would not survive him. So she had double\r\n\r\n      reason to guard him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But she had lost all confidence even within the walls of her own home.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Things had happened even there that defied her caution, her instinct, her\r\n\r\n      love. She had not spoken of these things save to the Chief of Police,\r\n\r\n      Koupriane, who had reported them to the Emperor. And here now was the man\r\n\r\n      whom the Emperor had sent, as the supreme resource, this young stranger\u2014Joseph\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut he is a mere boy!\u201d she exclaimed, without at all understanding the\r\n\r\n      matter, this youthful figure, with soft, rounded cheeks, eyes clear and,\r\n\r\n      at first view, extraordinarily naive, the eyes of an infant. True, at the\r\n\r\n      moment Rouletabille\u2019s expression hardly suggested any superhuman\r\n\r\n      profundity of thought, for, left in view of a table, spread with\r\n\r\n      hors-d\u2019oeuvres, the young man appeared solely occupied in digging out with\r\n\r\n      a spoon all the caviare that remained in the jars. Matrena noted the rosy\r\n\r\n      freshness of his cheeks, the absence of down on his lip and not a hint of\r\n\r\n      beard, the thick hair, with the curl over the forehead. Ah, that forehead\u2014the\r\n\r\n      forehead was curious, with great over-hanging cranial lumps which moved\r\n\r\n      above the deep arcade of the eye-sockets while the mouth was busy\u2014well,\r\n\r\n      one would have said that Rouletabille had not eaten for a week. He was\r\n\r\n      demolishing a great slice of Volgan sturgeon, contemplating at the same\r\n\r\n      time with immense interest a salad of creamed cucumbers, when Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna appeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He wished to excuse himself at once and spoke with his mouth full.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI beg your pardon, madame, but the Czar forgot to invite me to\r\n\r\n      breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Matrena smiled and gave him a hearty handshake as she urged him to\r\n\r\n      be seated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have seen His Majesty?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI come from him, madame. It is to Madame Trebassof that I have the honor\r\n\r\n      of speaking?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. And you are Monsieur\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJoseph Rouletabille, madame. I do not add, \u2018At your service\u2014because\r\n\r\n      I do not know about that yet. That is what I said just now to His\r\n\r\n      Majesty.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen?\u201d asked Madame Matrena, rather amused by the tone the conversation\r\n\r\n      had taken and the slightly flurried air of Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, then, I am a reporter, you see. That is what I said at once to my\r\n\r\n      editor in Paris, \u2018I am not going to take part in revolutionary affairs\r\n\r\n      that do not concern my country,\u2019 to which my editor replied, \u2018You do not\r\n\r\n      have to take part. You must go to Russia to make an inquiry into the\r\n\r\n      present status of the different parties. You will commence by interviewing\r\n\r\n      the Emperor.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, then, here goes,\u2019 and took the train.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you have interviewed the Emperor?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, yes, that has not been difficult. I expected to arrive direct at St.\r\n\r\n      Petersburg, but at Krasnoie-Coelo the train stopped and the grand-marshal\r\n\r\n      of the court came to me and asked me to follow him. It was very\r\n\r\n      flattering. Twenty minutes later I was before His Majesty. He awaited me!\r\n\r\n      I understood at once that this was obviously for something out of the\r\n\r\n      ordinary.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what did he say to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is a man of genuine majesty. He reassured me at once when I explained\r\n\r\n      my scruples to him. He said there was no occasion for me to take part in\r\n\r\n      the politics of the matter, but to save his most faithful servant, who was\r\n\r\n      on the point of becoming the victim of the strangest family drama ever\r\n\r\n      conceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Matrena, white as a sheet, rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u201d she said simply.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Rouletabille, whom nothing escaped, saw her hand tremble on the back\r\n\r\n      of the chair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He went on, not appearing to have noticed her emotion:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis Majesty added these exact words: \u2018It is I who ask it of you; I and\r\n\r\n      Madame Trebassof. Go, monsieur, she awaits you.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He ceased and waited for Madame Trebassof to speak.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She made up her mind after brief reflection.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you seen Koupriane?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Chief of Police? Yes. The grand-marshal accompanied me back to the\r\n\r\n      station at Krasnoie-Coelo, and the Chief of Police accompanied me to St.\r\n\r\n      Petersburg station. One could not have been better received.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Rouletabille,\u201d said Matrena, who visibly strove to regain her\r\n\r\n      self-control, \u201cI am not of Koupriane\u2019s opinion and I am not\u201d\u2014here\r\n\r\n      she lowered her trembling voice\u2014\u201cof the opinion His Majesty holds.\r\n\r\n      It is better for me to tell you at once, so that you may not regret\r\n\r\n      intervening in an affair where there are\u2014where there are\u2014risks\u2014terrible\r\n\r\n      risks to run. No, this is not a family drama. The family is small, very\r\n\r\n      small: the general, his daughter Natacha (by his former marriage), and\r\n\r\n      myself. There could not be a family drama among us three. It is simply\r\n\r\n      about my husband, monsieur, who did his duty as a soldier in defending the\r\n\r\n      throne of his sovereign, my husband whom they mean to assassinate! There\r\n\r\n      is nothing else, no other situation, my dear little guest.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      To hide her distress she started to carve a slice of jellied veal and\r\n\r\n      carrot.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have not eaten, you are hungry. It is dreadful, my dear young man.\r\n\r\n      See, you must dine with us, and then\u2014you will say adieu. Yes, you\r\n\r\n      will leave me all alone. I will undertake to save him all alone.\r\n\r\n      Certainly, I will undertake it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A tear fell on the slice she was cutting. Rouletabille, who felt the brave\r\n\r\n      woman\u2019s emotion affecting him also, braced himself to keep from showing\r\n\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am able to help you a little all the same,\u201d he said. \u201cMonsieur\r\n\r\n      Koupriane has told me that there is a deep mystery. It is my vocation to\r\n\r\n      get to the bottom of mysteries.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know what Koupriane thinks,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cBut if I\r\n\r\n      could bring myself to think that for a single day I would rather be dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The good Matrena Petrovna lifted her beautiful eyes to Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      brimming with the tears she held back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She added quickly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut eat now, my dear guest; eat. My dear child, you must forget what\r\n\r\n      Koupriane has said to you, when you are back in France.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI promise you that, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is the Emperor who has caused you this long journey. For me, I did not\r\n\r\n      wish it. Has he, indeed, so much confidence in you?\u201d she asked naively,\r\n\r\n      gazing at him fixedly through her tears.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, I was just about to tell you. I have been active in some\r\n\r\n      important matters that have been reported to him, and then sometimes your\r\n\r\n      Emperor is allowed to see the papers. He has heard talk, too (for\r\n\r\n      everybody talked of them, madame), about the Mystery of the Yellow Room\r\n\r\n      and the Perfume of the Lady in Black.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here Rouletabille watched Madame Trebassof and was much mortified at the\r\n\r\n      undoubted ignorance that showed in her frank face of either the yellow\r\n\r\n      room or the black perfume.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy young friend,\u201d said she, in a voice more and more hesitant, \u201cyou must\r\n\r\n      excuse me, but it is a long time since I have had good eyes for reading.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Tears, at last, ran down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille could not restrain himself any further. He saw in one flash\r\n\r\n      all this heroic woman had suffered in her combat day by day with the death\r\n\r\n      which hovered. He took her little fat hands, whose fingers were overloaded\r\n\r\n      with rings, tremulously into his own:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, do not weep. They wish to kill your husband. Well then, we will\r\n\r\n      be two at least to defend him, I swear to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEven against the Nihilists!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAye, madame, against all the world. I have eaten all your caviare. I am\r\n\r\n      your guest. I am your friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As he said this he was so excited, so sincere and so droll that Madame\r\n\r\n      Trebassof could not help smiling through her tears. She made him sit down\r\n\r\n      beside her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Chief of Police has talked of you a great deal. He came here abruptly\r\n\r\n      after the last attack and a mysterious happening that I will tell you\r\n\r\n      about. He cried, \u2018Ah, we need Rouletabille to unravel this!\u2019 The next day\r\n\r\n      he came here again. He had gone to the Court. There, everybody, it\r\n\r\n      appears, was talking of you. The Emperor wished to know you. That is why\r\n\r\n      steps were taken through the ambassador at Paris.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes. And naturally all the world has learned of it. That makes it so\r\n\r\n      lively. The Nihilists warned me immediately that I would not reach Russia\r\n\r\n      alive. That, finally, was what decided me on coming. I am naturally very\r\n\r\n      contrary.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd how did you get through the journey?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot badly. I discovered at once in the train a young Slav assigned to\r\n\r\n      kill me, and I reached an understanding with him. He was a charming youth,\r\n\r\n      so it was easily arranged.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was eating away now at strange viands that it would have been\r\n\r\n      difficult for him to name. Matrena Petrovna laid her fat little hand on\r\n\r\n      his arm:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou speak seriously?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery seriously.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA small glass of vodka?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo alcohol.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Matrena emptied her little glass at a draught.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd how did you discover him? How did you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFirst, he wore glasses. All Nihilists wear glasses when traveling. And\r\n\r\n      then I had a good clew. A minute before the departure from Paris I had a\r\n\r\n      friend go into the corridor of the sleeping-car, a reporter who would do\r\n\r\n      anything I said without even wanting to know why. I said, \u2018You call out\r\n\r\n      suddenly and very loud, \u201cHello, here is Rouletabille.\u201d\u2019 So he called,\r\n\r\n      \u2018Hello, here is Rouletabille,\u2019 and all those who were in the corridor\r\n\r\n      turned and all those who were already in the compartments came out,\r\n\r\n      excepting the man with the glasses. Then I was sure about him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Trebassof looked at Rouletabille, who turned as red as the comb of a\r\n\r\n      rooster and was rather embarrassed at his fatuity.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat deserves a rebuff, I know, madame, but from the moment the Emperor\r\n\r\n      of all the Russias had desired to see me I could not admit that any mere\r\n\r\n      man with glasses had not the curiosity to see what I looked like. It was\r\n\r\n      not natural. As soon as the train was off I sat down by this man and told\r\n\r\n      him who I thought he was. I was right. He removed his glasses and, looking\r\n\r\n      me straight in the eyes, said he was glad to have a little talk with me\r\n\r\n      before anything unfortunate happened. A half-hour later the\r\n\r\n      entente-cordiale was signed. I gave him to understand that I was coming\r\n\r\n      here simply on business as a reporter and that there was always time to\r\n\r\n      check me if I should be indiscreet. At the German frontier he left me to\r\n\r\n      go on, and returned tranquilly to his nitro-glycerine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are a marked man also, my poor boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, they have not got us yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna coughed. That us overwhelmed her. With what\r\n\r\n      calmness this boy that she had not known an hour proposed to share the\r\n\r\n      dangers of a situation that excited general pity but from which the\r\n\r\n      bravest kept aloof either from prudence or dismay.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, my friend, a little of this fine smoked Hamburg beef?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the young man was already pouring out fresh yellow beer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere,\u201d said he. \u201cNow, madame, I am listening. Tell me first about the\r\n\r\n      earliest attack.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow,\u201d said Matrena, \u201cwe must go to dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at her wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, madame, what have I just been doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Matrena smiled. All these strangers were alike. Because they had\r\n\r\n      eaten some hors-d\u2019oeuvres, some zakouskis, they imagined their host would\r\n\r\n      be satisfied. They did not know how to eat.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe will go to the dining-room. The general is expecting you. They are at\r\n\r\n      table.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI understand I am supposed to know him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, you have met in Paris. It is entirely natural that in passing\r\n\r\n      through St. Petersburg you should make him a visit. You know him very well\r\n\r\n      indeed, so well that he opens his home to you. Ah, yes, my step-daughter\r\n\r\n      also\u201d\u2014she flushed a little\u2014\u201cNatacha believes that her father\r\n\r\n      knows you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She opened the door of the drawing-room, which they had to cross in order\r\n\r\n      to reach the dining-room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      From his present position Rouletabille could see all the corners of the\r\n\r\n      drawing-room, the veranda, the garden and the entrance lodge at the gate.\r\n\r\n      In the veranda the man in the maroon frock-coat trimmed with false\r\n\r\n      astrakhan seemed still to be asleep on the sofa; in one of the corners of\r\n\r\n      the drawing-room another individual, silent and motionless as a statue,\r\n\r\n      dressed exactly the same, in a maroon frock-coat with false astrakhan,\r\n\r\n      stood with his hands behind his back seemingly struck with general\r\n\r\n      paralysis at the sight of a flaring sunset which illumined as with a torch\r\n\r\n      the golden spires of Saints Peter and Paul. And in the garden and before\r\n\r\n      the lodge three others dressed in maroon roved like souls in pain over the\r\n\r\n      lawn or back and forth at the entrance. Rouletabille motioned to Madame\r\n\r\n      Matrena, stepped back into the sitting-room and closed the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPolice?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna nodded her head and put her finger to her mouth in a\r\n\r\n      naive way, as one would caution a child to silence. Rouletabille smiled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow many are there?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTen, relieved every six hours.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat makes forty unknown men around your house each day.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot unknown,\u201d she replied. \u201cPolice.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYet, in spite of them, you have had the affair of the bouquet in the\r\n\r\n      general\u2019s chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, there were only three then. It is since the affair of the bouquet\r\n\r\n      that there have been ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt hardly matters. It is since these ten that you have had...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded anxiously.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know well\u2014the flooring.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSh-h-h.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She glanced at the door, watching the policeman statuesque before the\r\n\r\n      setting sun.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo one knows that\u2014not even my husband.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo M. Koupriane told me. Then it is you who have arranged for these ten\r\n\r\n      police-agents?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, we will commence now by sending all these police away.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna grasped his hand, astounded.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSurely you don\u2019t think of doing such a thing as that!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. We must know where the blow is coming from. You have four different\r\n\r\n      groups of people around here\u2014the police, the domestics, your\r\n\r\n      friends, your family. Get rid of the police first. They must not be\r\n\r\n      permitted to cross your threshold. They have not been able to protect you.\r\n\r\n      You have nothing to regret. And if, after they are gone, something new\r\n\r\n      turns up, we can leave M. Koupriane to conduct the inquiries without his\r\n\r\n      being preoccupied here at the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut you do not know the admirable police of Koupriane. These brave men\r\n\r\n      have given proof of their devotion.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, if I were face to face with a Nihilist the first thing I would\r\n\r\n      ask myself about him would be, \u2018Is he one of the police?\u2019 The first thing\r\n\r\n      I ask in the presence of an agent of your police is, \u2018Is he not a\r\n\r\n      Nihilist?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut they will not wish to go.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo any of them speak French?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, their sergeant, who is out there in the salon.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPray call him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Trebassof walked into the salon and signaled. The man appeared.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille handed him a paper, which the other read.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will gather your men together and quit the villa,\u201d ordered\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille. \u201cYou will return to the police Headguarters. Say to M.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane that I have commanded this and that I require all police service\r\n\r\n      around the villa to be suspended until further orders.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The man bowed, appeared not to understand, looked at Madame Trebassof and\r\n\r\n      said to the young man:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt your service.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He went out.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWait here a moment,\u201d urged Madame Trebassof, who did not know how to take\r\n\r\n      this abrupt action and whose anxiety was really painful to see.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She disappeared after the man of the false astrakhan. A few moments\r\n\r\n      afterwards she returned. She appeared even more agitated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut I cannot let them go like this.\r\n\r\n      They are much chagrined. They have insisted on knowing where they have\r\n\r\n      failed in their service. I have appeased them with money.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, and tell me the whole truth, madame. You have directed them not to\r\n\r\n      go far away, but to remain near the villa so as to watch it as closely as\r\n\r\n      possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She reddened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is true. But they have gone, nevertheless. They had to obey you. What\r\n\r\n      can that paper be you have shown them?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille drew out again the billet covered with seals and signs and\r\n\r\n      cabalistics that he did not understand. Madame Trebassof translated it\r\n\r\n      aloud: \u201cOrder to all officials in surveillance of the Villa Trebassof to\r\n\r\n      obey the bearer absolutely. Signed: Koupriane.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it possible!\u201d murmured Matrena Petrovna. \u201cBut Koupriane would never\r\n\r\n      have given you this paper if he had imagined that you would use it to\r\n\r\n      dismiss his agents.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently. I have not asked him his advice, madame, you may be sure. But\r\n\r\n      I will see him to-morrow and he will understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMeanwhile, who is going to watch over him?\u201d cried she.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille took her hands again. He saw her suffering, a prey to anguish\r\n\r\n      almost prostrating. He pitied her. He wished to give her immediate\r\n\r\n      confidence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe will,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She saw his young, clear eyes, so deep, so intelligent, the well-formed\r\n\r\n      young head, the willing face, all his young ardency for her, and it\r\n\r\n      reassured her. Rouletabille waited for what she might say. She said\r\n\r\n      nothing. She took him in her arms and embraced him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      II. NATACHA\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      In the dining-room it was Thaddeus Tchnichnikoff\u2019s turn to tell hunting\r\n\r\n      stories. He was the greatest timber-merchant in Lithuania. He owned\r\n\r\n      immense forests and he loved Feodor Feodorovitch* as a brother, for they\r\n\r\n      had played together all through their childhood, and once he had saved him\r\n\r\n      from a bear that was just about to crush his skull as one might knock off\r\n\r\n      a hat. General Trebassof\u2019s father was governor of Courlande at that time,\r\n\r\n      by the grace of God and the Little Father. Thaddeus, who was just thirteen\r\n\r\n      years old, killed the bear with a single stroke of his boar-spear, and\r\n\r\n      just in time. Close ties were knit between the two families by this\r\n\r\n      occurrence, and though Thaddeus was neither noble-born nor a soldier,\r\n\r\n      Feodor considered him his brother and felt toward him as such. Now\r\n\r\n      Thaddeus had become the greatest timber-merchant of the western provinces,\r\n\r\n      with his own forests and also with his massive body, his fat, oily face,\r\n\r\n      his bull-neck and his ample paunch. He quitted everything at once\u2014all\r\n\r\n      his affairs, his family\u2014as soon as he learned of the first attack,\r\n\r\n      to come and remain by the side of his dear comrade Feodor. He had done\r\n\r\n      this after each attack, without forgetting one. He was a faithful friend.\r\n\r\n      But he fretted because they might not go bear-hunting as in their youth.\r\n\r\n      \u2018Where, he would ask, are there any bears remaining in Courlande, or trees\r\n\r\n      for that matter, what you could call trees, growing since the days of the\r\n\r\n      grand-dukes of Lithuania, giant trees that threw their shade right up to\r\n\r\n      the very edge of the towns? Where were such things nowadays? Thaddeus was\r\n\r\n      very amusing, for it was he, certainly, who had cut them away tranquilly\r\n\r\n      enough and watched them vanish in locomotive smoke. It was what was called\r\n\r\n      Progress. Ah, hunting lost its national character assuredly with tiny\r\n\r\n      new-growth trees which had not had time to grow. And, besides, one\r\n\r\n      nowadays had not time for hunting. All the big game was so far away. Lucky\r\n\r\n      enough if one seized the time to bring down a brace of woodcock early in\r\n\r\n      the morning. At this point in Thaddeus\u2019s conversation there was a babble\r\n\r\n      of talk among the convivial gentlemen, for they had all the time in the\r\n\r\n      world at their disposal and could not see why he should be so concerned\r\n\r\n      about snatching a little while at morning or evening, or at midday for\r\n\r\n      that matter. Champagne was flowing like a river when Rouletabille was\r\n\r\n      brought in by Matrena Petrovna. The general, whose eyes had been on the\r\n\r\n      door for some time, cried at once, as though responding to a cue:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, my dear Rouletabille! I have been looking for you. Our friends wrote\r\n\r\n      me you were coming to St. Petersburg.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille hurried over to him and they shook hands like friends who\r\n\r\n      meet after a long separation. The reporter was presented to the company as\r\n\r\n      a close young friend from Paris whom they had enjoyed so much during their\r\n\r\n      latest visit to the City of Light. Everybody inquired for the latest word\r\n\r\n      of Paris as of a dear acquaintance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow is everybody at Maxim\u2019s?\u201d urged the excellent Athanase Georgevitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thaddeus, too, had been once in Paris and he returned with an enthusiastic\r\n\r\n      liking for the French demoiselles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVos gogottes, monsieur,\u201d he said, appearing very amiable and leaning on\r\n\r\n      each word, with a guttural emphasis such as is common in the western\r\n\r\n      provinces, \u201cah, vos gogottes!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Perovna tried to silence him, but Thaddeus insisted on his right\r\n\r\n      to appreciate the fair sex away from home. He had a turgid, sentimental\r\n\r\n      wife, always weeping and cramming her religious notions down his throat.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Of course someone asked Rouletabille what he thought of Russia, but he had\r\n\r\n      no more than opened his mouth to reply than Athanase Georgevitch closed it\r\n\r\n      by interrupting:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPermettez! Permettez! You others, of the young generation, what do you\r\n\r\n      know of it? You need to have lived a long time and in all its districts to\r\n\r\n      appreciate Russia at its true value. Russia, my young sir, is as yet a\r\n\r\n      closed book to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNaturally,\u201d Rouletabille answered, smiling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, well, here\u2019s your health! What I would point out to you first of\r\n\r\n      all is that it is a good buyer of champagne, eh?\u201d\u2014and he gave a huge\r\n\r\n      grin. \u201cBut the hardest drinker I ever knew was born on the banks of the\r\n\r\n      Seine. Did you know him, Feodor Feodorovitch? Poor Charles Dufour, who\r\n\r\n      died two years ago at fete of the officers of the Guard. He wagered at the\r\n\r\n      end of the banquet that he could drink a glassful of champagne to the\r\n\r\n      health of each man there. There were sixty when you came to count them. He\r\n\r\n      commenced the round of the table and the affair went splendidly up to the\r\n\r\n      fifty-eighth man. But at the fifty-ninth\u2014think of the misfortune!\u2014the\r\n\r\n      champagne ran out! That poor, that charming, that excellent Charles took\r\n\r\n      up a glass of vin dore which was in the glass of this fifty-ninth, wished\r\n\r\n      him long life, drained the glass at one draught, had just time to murmur,\r\n\r\n      \u2018Tokay, 1807,\u2019 and fell back dead! Ah, he knew the brands, my word! and he\r\n\r\n      proved it to his last breath! Peace to his ashes! They asked what he died\r\n\r\n      of. I knew he died because of the inappropriate blend of flavors. There\r\n\r\n      should be discipline in all things and not promiscuous mixing. One more\r\n\r\n      glass of champagne and he would have been drinking with us this evening.\r\n\r\n      Your health, Matrena Petrovna. Champagne, Feodor Feodorovitch! Vive la\r\n\r\n      France, monsieur! Natacha, my child, you must sing something. Boris will\r\n\r\n      accompany you on the guzla. Your father will enjoy it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      All eyes turned toward Natacha as she rose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was struck by her serene beauty. That was the first\r\n\r\n      enthralling impression, an impression so strong it astonished him, the\r\n\r\n      perfect serenity, the supreme calm, the tranquil harmony of her noble\r\n\r\n      features. Natacha was twenty. Heavy brown hair circled about er forehead\r\n\r\n      and was looped about her ears, which were half-concealed. Her profile was\r\n\r\n      clear-cut; her mouth was strong and revealed between red, firm lips the\r\n\r\n      even pearliness of her teeth. She was of medium height. In walking she had\r\n\r\n      the free, light step of the highborn maidens who, in primal times, pressed\r\n\r\n      the flowers as they passed without crushing them. But all her true grace\r\n\r\n      seemed to be concentrated in her eyes, which were deep and of a dark blue.\r\n\r\n      The impression she made upon a beholder was very complex. And it would\r\n\r\n      have been difficult to say whether the calm which pervaded every\r\n\r\n      manifestation of her beauty was the result of conscious control or the\r\n\r\n      most perfect ease.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She took down the guzla and handed it to Boris, who struck some plaintive\r\n\r\n      preliminary chords.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat shall I sing?\u201d she inquired, raising her father\u2019s hand from the back\r\n\r\n      of the sofa where he rested and kissing it with filial tenderness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cImprovise,\u201d said the general. \u201cImprovise in French, for the sake of our\r\n\r\n      guest.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, yes,\u201d cried Boris; \u201cimprovise as you did the other evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He immediately struck a minor chord.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha looked fondly at her father as she sang:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s voice was sweet, and the charm of it subtly pervasive. The words\r\n\r\n      as she uttered them seemed to have all the quality of a prayer and there\r\n\r\n      were tears in all eyes, excepting those of Michael Korsakoff, the second\r\n\r\n      orderly, whom Rouletabille appraised as a man with a rough heart not much\r\n\r\n      open to sentiment.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFeodor Feodorovitch,\u201d said this officer, when the young girl\u2019s voice had\r\n\r\n      faded away into the blending with the last note of the guzla, \u201cFeodor\r\n\r\n      Feodorovitch is a man and a glorious soldier who is able to sleep in\r\n\r\n      peace, because he has labored for his country and for his Czar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes. Labored well! A glorious soldier!\u201d repeated Athanase\r\n\r\n      Georgevitch and Ivan Petrovitch. \u201cWell may he sleep peacefully.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha sang like an angel,\u201d said Boris, the first orderly, in a\r\n\r\n      tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLike an angel, Boris Nikolaievitch. But why did she speak of his heart\r\n\r\n      oppressed? I don\u2019t see that General Trebassof has a heart oppressed, for\r\n\r\n      my part.\u201d Michael Korsakoff spoke roughly as he drained his glass.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, that\u2019s so, isn\u2019t it?\u201d agreed the others.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA young girl may wish her father a pleasant sleep, surely!\u201d said Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna, with a certain good sense. \u201cNatacha has affected us all, has she\r\n\r\n      not, Feodor?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, she made me weep,\u201d declared the general. \u201cBut let us have champagne\r\n\r\n      to cheer us up. Our young friend here will think we are chicken-hearted.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever think that,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cMademoiselle has touched me deeply\r\n\r\n      as well. She is an artist, really a great artist. And a poet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is from Paris; he knows,\u201d said the others.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And all drank.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then they talked about music, with great display of knowledge concerning\r\n\r\n      things operatic. First one, then another went to the piano and ran through\r\n\r\n      some motif that the rest hummed a little first, then shouted in a rousing\r\n\r\n      chorus. Then they drank more, amid a perfect fracas of talk and laughter.\r\n\r\n      Ivan Petrovitch and Athanase Georgevitch walked across and kissed the\r\n\r\n      general. Rouletabille saw all around him great children who amused\r\n\r\n      themselves with unbelievable naivete and who drank in a fashion more\r\n\r\n      unbelievable still. Matrena Petrovna smoked cigarettes of yellow tobacco\r\n\r\n      incessantly, rising almost continually to make a hurried round of the\r\n\r\n      rooms, and after having prompted the servants to greater watchfulness, sat\r\n\r\n      and looked long at Rouletabille, who did not stir, but caught every word,\r\n\r\n      every gesture of each one there. Finally, sighing, she sat down by Feodor\r\n\r\n      and asked how his leg felt. Michael and Natacha, in a corner, were deep in\r\n\r\n      conversation, and Boris watched them with obvious impatience, still\r\n\r\n      strumming the guzla. But the thing that struck Rouletabille\u2019s youthful\r\n\r\n      imagination beyond all else was the mild face of the general. He had not\r\n\r\n      imagined the terrible Trebassof with so paternal and sympathetic an\r\n\r\n      expression. The Paris papers had printed redoubtable pictures of him, more\r\n\r\n      or less authentic, but the arts of photography and engraving had cut\r\n\r\n      vigorous, rough features of an official\u2014who knew no pity. Such\r\n\r\n      pictures were in perfect accord with the idea one naturally had of the\r\n\r\n      dominating figure of the government at Moscow, the man who, during eight\r\n\r\n      days\u2014the Red Week\u2014had made so many corpses of students and\r\n\r\n      workmen that the halls of the University and the factories had opened\r\n\r\n      their doors since in vain. The dead would have had to arise for those\r\n\r\n      places to be peopled! Days of terrible battle where in one quarter or\r\n\r\n      another of the city there was naught but massacre or burnings, until\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna and her step-daughter, Natacha (all the papers told of\r\n\r\n      it), had fallen on their knees before the general and begged terms for the\r\n\r\n      last of the revolutionaries, at bay in the Presnia quarter, and had been\r\n\r\n      refused by him. \u201cWar is war,\u201d had been his answer, with irrefutable logic.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow can you ask mercy for these men who never give it?\u201d Be it said for\r\n\r\n      the young men of the barricades that they never surrendered, and equally\r\n\r\n      be it said for Trebassof that he necessarily shot them. \u201cIf I had only\r\n\r\n      myself to consider,\u201d the general had said to a Paris journalist, \u201cI could\r\n\r\n      have been gentle as a lamb with these unfortunates, and so I should not\r\n\r\n      now myself be condemned to death. After all, I fail to see what they\r\n\r\n      reproach me with. I have served my master as a brave and loyal subject, no\r\n\r\n      more, and, after the fighting, I have let others ferret out the children\r\n\r\n      that had hidden under their mothers\u2019 skirts. Everybody talks of the\r\n\r\n      repression of Moscow, but let us speak, my friend, of the Commune. There\r\n\r\n      was a piece of work I would not have done, to massacre within a court an\r\n\r\n      unresisting crowd of men, women and children. I am a rough and faithful\r\n\r\n      soldier of His Majesty, but I am not a monster, and I have the feelings of\r\n\r\n      a husband and father, my dear monsieur. Tell your readers that, if you\r\n\r\n      care to, and do not surmise further about whether I appear to regret being\r\n\r\n      condemned to death.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Certainly what stupefied Rouletabille now was this staunch figure of the\r\n\r\n      condemned man who appeared so tranquilly to enjoy his life. When the\r\n\r\n      general was not furthering the gayety of his friends he was talking with\r\n\r\n      his wife and daughter, who adored him and continually fondled him, and he\r\n\r\n      seemed perfectly happy. With his enormous grizzly mustache, his ruddy\r\n\r\n      color, his keen, piercing eyes, he looked the typical spoiled father.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter studied all these widely-different types and made his\r\n\r\n      observations while pretending to a ravenous appetite, which served,\r\n\r\n      moreover, to fix him in the good graces of his hosts of the datcha des\r\n\r\n      Iles. But, in reality, he passed the food to an enormous bull-dog under\r\n\r\n      the table, in whose good graces he was also thus firmly planting himself.\r\n\r\n      As Trebassof had prayed his companions to let his young friend satisfy his\r\n\r\n      ravening hunger in peace, they did not concern themselves to entertain\r\n\r\n      him. Then, too, the music served to distract attention from him, and at a\r\n\r\n      moment somewhat later, when Matrena Petrovna turned to speak to the young\r\n\r\n      man, she was frightened at not seeing him. Where had he gone? She went out\r\n\r\n      into the veranda and looked. She did not dare to call. She walked into the\r\n\r\n      grand-salon and saw the reporter just as he came out of the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere were you?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe sitting-room is certainly charming, and decorated exquisitely,\u201d\r\n\r\n       complimented Rouletabille. \u201cIt seems almost a boudoir.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt does serve as a boudoir for my step-daughter, whose bedroom opens\r\n\r\n      directly from it; you see the door there. It is simply for the present\r\n\r\n      that the luncheon table is set there, because for some time the police\r\n\r\n      have pre-empted the veranda.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs your dog a watch-dog, madame?\u201d asked Rouletabille, caressing the\r\n\r\n      beast, which had followed him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cKhor is faithful and had guarded us well hitherto.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe sleeps now, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. Koupriane has him shut in the lodge to keep him from barking nights.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane fears that if he is out he will devour one of the police who\r\n\r\n      watch in the garden at night. I wanted him to sleep in the house, or by\r\n\r\n      his master\u2019s door, or even at the foot of the bed, but Koupriane said,\r\n\r\n      \u2018No, no; no dog. Don\u2019t rely on the dog. Nothing is more dangerous than to\r\n\r\n      rely on the dog. \u2018Since then he has kept Khor locked up at night. But I do\r\n\r\n      not understand Koupriane\u2019s idea.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Koupriane is right,\u201d said the reporter. \u201cDogs are useful only\r\n\r\n      against strangers.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh,\u201d gasped the poor woman, dropping her eyes. \u201cKoupriane certainly knows\r\n\r\n      his business; he thinks of everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome,\u201d she added rapidly, as though to hide her disquiet, \u201cdo not go out\r\n\r\n      like that without letting me know. They want you in the dining-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI must have you tell me right now about this attempt.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the dining-room, in the dining-room. In spite of myself,\u201d she said in\r\n\r\n      a low voice, \u201cit is stronger than I am. I am not able to leave the general\r\n\r\n      by himself while he is on the ground-floor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She drew Rouletabille into the dining-room, where the gentlemen were now\r\n\r\n      telling odd stories of street robberies amid loud laughter. Natacha was\r\n\r\n      still talking with Michael Korsakoff; Boris, whose eyes never quitted\r\n\r\n      them, was as pale as the wax on his guzla, which he rattled violently from\r\n\r\n      time to time. Matrena made Rouletabille sit in a corner of the sofa, near\r\n\r\n      her, and, counting on her fingers like a careful housewife who does not\r\n\r\n      wish to overlook anything in her domestic calculations, she said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere have been three attempts; the first two in Moscow. The first\r\n\r\n      happened very simply. The general knew he had been condemned to death.\r\n\r\n      They had delivered to him at the palace in the afternoon the\r\n\r\n      revoluntionary poster which proclaimed his intended fate to the whole city\r\n\r\n      and country. So Feodor, who was just about to ride into the city,\r\n\r\n      dismissed his escort. He ordered horses put to a sleigh. I trembled and\r\n\r\n      asked what he was going to do. He said he was going to drive quietly\r\n\r\n      through all parts of the city, in order to show the Muscovites that a\r\n\r\n      governor appointed according to law by the Little Father and who had in\r\n\r\n      his conscience only the sense that he had done his full duty was not to be\r\n\r\n      intimidated. It was nearly four o\u2019clock, toward the end of a winter day\r\n\r\n      that had been clear and bright, but very cold. I wrapped myself in my furs\r\n\r\n      and took my seat beside him, and he said, \u2018This is fine, Matrena; this\r\n\r\n      will have a great effect on these imbeciles.\u2019 So we started. At first we\r\n\r\n      drove along the Naberjnaia. The sleigh glided like the wind. The general\r\n\r\n      hit the driver a heavy blow in the back, crying, \u2018Slower, fool; they will\r\n\r\n      think we are afraid,\u2019 and so the horses were almost walking when, passing\r\n\r\n      behind the Church of Protection and intercession, we reached the Place\r\n\r\n      Rouge. Until then the few passers-by had looked at us, and as they\r\n\r\n      recognized him, hurried along to keep him in view. At the Place Rouge\r\n\r\n      there was only a little knot of women kneeling before the Virgin. As soon\r\n\r\n      as these women saw us and recognized the equipage of the Governor, they\r\n\r\n      dispersed like a flock of crows, with frightened cries. Feodor laughed so\r\n\r\n      hard that as we passed under the vault of the Virgin his laugh seemed to\r\n\r\n      shake the stones. I felt reassured, monsieur. Our promenade continued\r\n\r\n      without any remarkable incident. The city was almost deserted. Everything\r\n\r\n      lay prostrated under the awful blow of that battle in the street. Feodor\r\n\r\n      said, \u2018Ah, they give me a wide berth; they do not know how much I love\r\n\r\n      them,\u201d and all through that promenade he said many more charming and\r\n\r\n      delicate things to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs we were talking pleasantly under our furs we came to la Place\r\n\r\n      Koudrinsky, la rue Koudrinsky, to be exact. It was just four o\u2019clock, and\r\n\r\n      a light mist had commenced to mix with the sifting snow, and the houses to\r\n\r\n      right and left were visible only as masses of shadow. We glided over the\r\n\r\n      snow like a boat along the river in foggy calm. Then, suddenly, we heard\r\n\r\n      piercing cries and saw shadows of soldiers rushing around, with movements\r\n\r\n      that looked larger than human through the mist; their short whips looked\r\n\r\n      enormous as they knocked some other shadows that we saw down like logs.\r\n\r\n      The general stopped the sleigh and got out to see what was going on. I got\r\n\r\n      out with him. They were soldiers of the famous Semenowsky regiment, who\r\n\r\n      had two prisoners, a young man and a child. The child was being beaten on\r\n\r\n      the nape of the neck. It writhed on the ground and cried in torment. It\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t have been more than nine years old. The other, the young man,\r\n\r\n      held himself up and marched along without a single cry as the thongs fell\r\n\r\n      brutally upon him. I was appalled. I did not give my husband time to open\r\n\r\n      his mouth before I called to the subaltern who commanded the detachment,\r\n\r\n      \u2018You should be ashamed to strike a child and a Christian like that, which\r\n\r\n      cannot defend itself.\u2019 The general told him the same thing. Then the\r\n\r\n      subaltern told us that the little child had just killed a lieutenant in\r\n\r\n      the street by firing a revolver, which he showed us, and it was the\r\n\r\n      biggest one I ever have seen, and must have been as heavy for that infant\r\n\r\n      to lift as a small cannon. It was unbelievable.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And the other,\u2019 demanded the general; \u2018what has he done?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He is a dangerous student,\u2019 replied the subaltern, \u2018who has delivered\r\n\r\n      himself up as a prisoner because he promised the landlord of the house\r\n\r\n      where he lives that he would do it to keep the house from being battered\r\n\r\n      down with cannon.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But that is right of him. Why do you beat him?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Because he has told us he is a dangerous student.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That is no reason,\u2019 Feodor told him. \u2018He will be shot if he deserves it,\r\n\r\n      and the child also, but I forbid you to beat him. You have not been\r\n\r\n      furnished with these whips in order to beat isolated prisoners, but to\r\n\r\n      charge the crowd when it does not obey the governor\u2019s orders. In such a\r\n\r\n      case you are ordered \u201cCharge,\u201d and you know what to do. You understand?\u2019 \r\n\r\n      Feodor said roughly. \u2018I am General Trebassof, your governor.\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFeodor was thoroughly human in saying this. Ah, well, he was badly\r\n\r\n      compensed for it, very badly, I tell you. The student was truly dangerous,\r\n\r\n      because he had no sooner heard my husband say, \u2018I am General Trebassof,\r\n\r\n      your governor,\u2019 than he cried, \u2018Ah, is it you, Trebassoff\u2019 and drew a\r\n\r\n      revolver from no one knows where and fired straight at the general, almost\r\n\r\n      against his breast. But the general was not hit, happily, nor I either,\r\n\r\n      who was by him and had thrown myself onto the student to disarm him and\r\n\r\n      then was tossed about at the feet of the soldiers in the battle they waged\r\n\r\n      around the student while the revolver was going off. Three soldiers were\r\n\r\n      killed. You can understand that the others were furious. They raised me\r\n\r\n      with many excuses and, all together, set to kicking the student in the\r\n\r\n      loins and striking at him as he lay on the ground. The subaltern struck\r\n\r\n      his face a blow that might have blinded him. Feodor hit the officer in the\r\n\r\n      head with his fist and called, \u2018Didn\u2019t you hear what I said?\u2019 The officer\r\n\r\n      fell under the blow and Feodor himself carried him to the sleigh and laid\r\n\r\n      him with the dead men. Then he took charge of the soldiers and led them to\r\n\r\n      the barracks. I followed, as a sort of after-guard. We returned to the\r\n\r\n      palace an hour later. It was quite dark by then, and almost at the\r\n\r\n      entrance to the palace we were shot at by a group of revolutionaries who\r\n\r\n      passed swiftly in two sleighs and disappeared in the darkness so fast that\r\n\r\n      they could not be overtaken. I had a ball in my toque. The general had not\r\n\r\n      been touched this time either, but our furs were ruined by the blood of\r\n\r\n      the dead soldiers which they had forgotten to clean out of the sleigh.\r\n\r\n      That was the first attempt, which meant little enough, after all, because\r\n\r\n      it was fighting in the open. It was some days later that they commenced to\r\n\r\n      try assassination.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At this moment Ermolai brought in four bottles of champagne and Thaddeus\r\n\r\n      struck lightly on the piano.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuickly, madame, the second attempt,\u201d said Rouletabille, who was aking\r\n\r\n      hasty notes on his cuff, never ceasing, meanwhile, to watch the convivial\r\n\r\n      group and listening with both ears wide open to Matrena.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe second happened still in Moscow. We had had a jolly dinner because we\r\n\r\n      thought that at last the good old days were back and good citizens could\r\n\r\n      live in peace; and Boris had tried out the guzla singing songs of the Orel\r\n\r\n      country to please me; he is so fine and sympathetic. Natacha had gone\r\n\r\n      somewhere or other. The sleigh was waiting at the door and we went out and\r\n\r\n      got in. Almost instantly there was a fearful noise, and we were thrown out\r\n\r\n      into the snow, both the general and me. There remained no trace of sleigh\r\n\r\n      or coachman; the two horses were disemboweled, two magnificent piebald\r\n\r\n      horses, my dear young monsieur, that the general was so attached to. As to\r\n\r\n      Feodor, he had that serious wound in his right leg; the calf was\r\n\r\n      shattered. I simply had my shoulder a little wrenched, practically\r\n\r\n      nothing. The bomb had been placed under the seat of the unhappy coachman,\r\n\r\n      whose hat alone we found, in a pool of blood. From that attack the general\r\n\r\n      lay two months in bed. In the second month they arrested two servants who\r\n\r\n      were caught one night on the landing leading to the upper floor, where\r\n\r\n      they had no business, and after that I sent at once for our old domestics\r\n\r\n      in Orel to come and serve us. It was discovered that these detected\r\n\r\n      servants were in touch with the revolutionaries, so they were hanged. The\r\n\r\n      Emperor appointed a provisional governor, and now that the general was\r\n\r\n      better we decided on a convalescence for him in the midi of France. We\r\n\r\n      took train for St. Petersburg, but the journey started high fever in my\r\n\r\n      husband and reopened the wound in his calf. The doctors ordered absolute\r\n\r\n      rest and so we settled here in the datcha des Iles. Since then, not a day\r\n\r\n      has passed without the general receiving an anonymous letter telling him\r\n\r\n      that nothing can save him from the revenge of the revolutionaries. He is\r\n\r\n      brave and only smiles over them, but for me, I know well that so long as\r\n\r\n      we are in Russia we have not a moment\u2019s security. So I watch him every\r\n\r\n      minute and let no one approach him except his intimate friends and us of\r\n\r\n      the family. I have brought an old gniagnia who watched me grow up,\r\n\r\n      Ermolai, and the Orel servants. In the meantime, two months later, the\r\n\r\n      third attempt suddenly occurred. It is certainly of them all the most\r\n\r\n      frightening, because it is so mysterious, a mystery that has not yet,\r\n\r\n      alas, been solved.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Athanase Georgevitch had told a \u201cgood story\u201d which raised so much\r\n\r\n      hubbub that nothing else could be heard. Feodor Feodorovitch was so amused\r\n\r\n      that he had tears in his eyes. Rouletabille said to himself as Matrena\r\n\r\n      talked, \u201cI never have seen men so gay, and yet they know perfectly they\r\n\r\n      are apt to be blown up all together any moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      General Trebassof, who had steadily watched Rouletabille, who, for that\r\n\r\n      matter, had been kept in eye by everyone there, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh, eh, monsieur le journaliste, you find us very gay?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI find you very brave,\u201d said Rouletabille quietly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow is that?\u201d said Feodor Feodorovitch, smiling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou must pardon me for thinking of the things that you seem to have\r\n\r\n      forgotten entirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He indicated the general\u2019s wounded leg.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe chances of war! the chances of war!\u201d said the general. \u201cA leg here,\r\n\r\n      an arm there. But, as you see, I am still here. They will end by growing\r\n\r\n      tired and leaving me in peace. Your health, my friend!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour health, general!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou understand,\u201d continued Feodor Feodorovitch, \u201cthere is no occasion to\r\n\r\n      excite ourselves. It is our business to defend the empire at the peril of\r\n\r\n      our lives. We find that quite natural, and there is no occasion to think\r\n\r\n      of it. I have had terrors enough in other directions, not to speak of the\r\n\r\n      terrors of love, that are more ferocious than you can yet imagine. Look at\r\n\r\n      what they did to my poor friend the Chief of the Surete, Boichlikoff. He\r\n\r\n      was commendable certainly. There was a brave man. Of an evening, when his\r\n\r\n      work was over, he always left the bureau of the prefecture and went to\r\n\r\n      join his wife and children in their apartment in the ruelle des Loups. Not\r\n\r\n      a soldier! No guard! The others had every chance. One evening a score of\r\n\r\n      revolutionaries, after having driven away the terrorized servants, mounted\r\n\r\n      to his apartments. He was dining with his family. They knocked and he\r\n\r\n      opened the door. He saw who they were, and tried to speak. They gave him\r\n\r\n      no time. Before his wife and children, mad with terror and on their knees\r\n\r\n      before the revolutionaries, they read him his death-sentence. A fine end\r\n\r\n      that to a dinner!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As he listened Rouletabille paled and he kept his eyes on the door as if\r\n\r\n      he expected to see it open of itself, giving access to ferocious Nihilists\r\n\r\n      of whom one, with a paper in his hand, would read the sentence of death to\r\n\r\n      Feodor Feodorovitch. Rouletabille\u2019s stomach was not yet seasoned to such\r\n\r\n      stories. He almost regretted, momentarily, having taken the terrible\r\n\r\n      responsibility of dismissing the police. After what Koupriane had confided\r\n\r\n      to him of things that had happened in this house, he had not hesitated to\r\n\r\n      risk everything on that audacious decision, but all the same, all the same\u2014these\r\n\r\n      stories of Nihilists who appear at the end of a meal, death-sentence in\r\n\r\n      hand, they haunted him, they upset him. Certainly it had been a piece of\r\n\r\n      foolhardiness to dismiss the police!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d he asked, conquering his misgivings and resuming, as always, his\r\n\r\n      confidence in himself, \u201cthen, what did they do then, after reading the\r\n\r\n      sentence?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Chief of the Surete knew he had no time to spare. He did not ask for\r\n\r\n      it. The revolutionaries ordered him to bid his family farewell. He raised\r\n\r\n      his wife, his children, clasped them, bade them be of good courage, then\r\n\r\n      said he was ready. They took him into the street. They stood him against a\r\n\r\n      wall. His wife and children watched from a window. A volley sounded. They\r\n\r\n      descended to secure the body, pierced with twenty-five bullets.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat was exactly the number of wounds that were made on the body of\r\n\r\n      little Jacques Zloriksky,\u201d came in the even tones of Natacha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, you, you always find an excuse,\u201d grumbled the general. \u201cPoor\r\n\r\n      Boichlikoff did his duty, as I did mine.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, papa, you acted like a soldier. That is what the revolutionaries\r\n\r\n      ought not to forget. But have no fears for us, papa; because if they kill\r\n\r\n      you we will all die with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd gayly too,\u201d declared Athanase Georgevitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey should come this evening. We are in form!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Upon which Athanase filled the glasses again.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone the less, permit me to say,\u201d ventured the timber-merchant, Thaddeus\r\n\r\n      Tchnitchnikof, timidly, \u201cpermit me to say that this Boichlikoff was very\r\n\r\n      imprudent.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, indeed, very gravely imprudent,\u201d agreed Rouletabille. \u201cWhen a man\r\n\r\n      has had twenty-five good bullets shot into the body of a child, he ought\r\n\r\n      certainly to keep his home well guarded if he wishes to dine in peace.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He stammered a little toward the end of this, because it occurred to him\r\n\r\n      that it was a little inconsistent to express such opinions, seeing what he\r\n\r\n      had done with the guard over the general.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u201d cried Athanase Georgevitch, in a stage-struck voice, \u201cAh, it was not\r\n\r\n      imprudence! It was contempt of death! Yes, it was contempt of death that\r\n\r\n      killed him! Even as the contempt of death keeps us, at this moment, in\r\n\r\n      perfect health. To you, ladies and gentlemen! Do you know anything\r\n\r\n      lovelier, grander, in the world than contempt of death? Gaze on Feodor\r\n\r\n      Feodorovitch and answer me. Superb! My word, superb! To you all! The\r\n\r\n      revolutionaries who are not of the police are of the same mind regarding\r\n\r\n      our heroes. They may curse the tchinownicks who execute the terrible\r\n\r\n      orders given them by those higher up, but those who are not of the police\r\n\r\n      (there are some, I believe)\u2014these surely recognize that men like the\r\n\r\n      Chief of the Surete our dead friend, are brave.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly,\u201d endorsed the general. \u201cCounting all things, they need more\r\n\r\n      heroism for a promenade in a salon than a soldier on a battle-field.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have met some of these men,\u201d continued Athanase in exalted vein. \u201cI\r\n\r\n      have found in all their homes the same\u2014imprudence, as our young\r\n\r\n      French friend calls it. A few days after the assassination of the Chief of\r\n\r\n      Police in Moscow I was received by his successor in the same place where\r\n\r\n      the assassination had occurred. He did not take the slightest precaution\r\n\r\n      with me, whom he did not know at all, nor with men of the middle class who\r\n\r\n      came to present their petitions, in spite of the fact that it was under\r\n\r\n      precisely identical conditions that his predecessor had been slain. Before\r\n\r\n      I left I looked over to where on the floor there had so recently occurred\r\n\r\n      such agony. They had placed a rug there and on the rug a table, and on\r\n\r\n      that table there was a book. Guess what book. \u2018Women\u2019s Stockings,\u2019 by\r\n\r\n      Willy! And\u2014and then\u2014Your health, Matrena Petrovna. What\u2019s the\r\n\r\n      odds!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou yourselves, my friends,\u201d declared the general, \u201cprove your great\r\n\r\n      courage by coming to share the hours that remain of my life with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot at all, not at all! It is war.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it is war.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, there\u2019s no occasion to pat us on the shoulder, Athanase,\u201d insisted\r\n\r\n      Thaddeus modestly. \u201cWhat risk do we run? We are well guarded.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are protected by the finger of God,\u201d declared Athanase, \u201cbecause the\r\n\r\n      police\u2014well, I haven\u2019t any confidence in the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Michael Korsakoff, who had been for a turn in the garden, entered during\r\n\r\n      the remark.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe happy, then, Athanase Georgevitch,\u201d said he, \u201cfor there are now no\r\n\r\n      police around the villa.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere are they?\u201d inquired the timber-merchant uneasily.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn order came from Koupriane to remove them,\u201d explained Matrena Petrovna,\r\n\r\n      who exerted herself to appear calm.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd are they not replaced?\u201d asked Michael.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo. It is incomprehensible. There must have been some confusion in the\r\n\r\n      orders given.\u201d And Matrena reddened, for she loathed a lie and it was in\r\n\r\n      tribulation of spirit that she used this fable under Rouletabille\u2019s\r\n\r\n      directions.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, well, all the better,\u201d said the general. \u201cIt will give me pleasure to\r\n\r\n      see my home ridded for a while of such people.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Athanase was naturally of the same mind as the general, and when Thaddeus\r\n\r\n      and Ivan Petrovitch and the orderlies offered to pass the night at the\r\n\r\n      villa and take the place of the absent police, Feodor Feodorovitch caught\r\n\r\n      a gesture from Rouletabille which disapproved the idea of this new guard.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no,\u201d cried the general emphatically. \u201cYou leave at the usual time. I\r\n\r\n      want now to get back into the ordinary run of things, my word! To live as\r\n\r\n      everyone else does. We shall be all right. Koupriane and I have arranged\r\n\r\n      the matter. Koupriane is less sure of his men, after all, than I am of my\r\n\r\n      servants. You understand me. I do not need to explain further. You will go\r\n\r\n      home to bed\u2014and we will all sleep. Those are the orders. Besides,\r\n\r\n      you must remember that the guard-post is only a step from here, at the\r\n\r\n      corner of the road, and we have only to give a signal to bring them all\r\n\r\n      here. But\u2014more secret agents or special police\u2014no, no!\r\n\r\n      Good-night. All of us to bed now!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They did not insist further. When Feodor had said, \u201cThose are the orders,\u201d\r\n\r\n       there was room for nothing more, not even in the way of polite insistence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But before going to their beds all went into the veranda, where liqueurs\r\n\r\n      were served by the brave Ermolai, as always. Matrena pushed the\r\n\r\n      wheel-chair of the general there, and he kept repeating, \u201cNo, no. No more\r\n\r\n      such people. No more police. They only bring trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFeodor! Feodor!\u201d sighed Matrena, whose anxiety deepened in spite of all\r\n\r\n      she could do, \u201cthey watched over your dear life.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLife is dear to me only because of you, Matrena Petrovna.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd not at all because of me, papa?\u201d said Natacha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, Natacha!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He took both her hands in his. It was an affecting glimpse of family\r\n\r\n      intimacy.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      From time to time, while Ermolai poured the liqueurs, Feodor struck his\r\n\r\n      band on the coverings over his leg.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt gets better,\u201d said he. \u201cIt gets better.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then melancholy showed in his rugged face, and he watched night deepen\r\n\r\n      over the isles, the golden night of St. Petersburg. It was not quite yet\r\n\r\n      the time of year for what they call the golden nights there, the \u201cwhite\r\n\r\n      nights,\u201d nights which never deepen to darkness, but they were already\r\n\r\n      beautiful in their soft clarity, caressed, here by the Gulf of Finland,\r\n\r\n      almost at the same time by the last and the first rays of the sun, by\r\n\r\n      twilight and dawn.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      From the height of the veranda one of the most beautiful bits of the isles\r\n\r\n      lay in view, and the hour was so lovely that its charm thrilled these\r\n\r\n      people, of whom several, as Thaddeus, were still close to nature. It was\r\n\r\n      he, first, who called to Natacha:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha! Natacha! Sing us your \u2018Soir des Iles.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s voice floated out upon the peace of the islands under the dim\r\n\r\n      arched sky, light and clear as a night rose, and the guzla of Boris\r\n\r\n      accompanied it. Natacha sang:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is the night of the Isles\u2014at the north of the world. The sky\r\n\r\n      presses in its stainless arms the bosom of earth, Night kisses the rose\r\n\r\n      that dawn gave to the twilight. And the night air is sweet and fresh from\r\n\r\n      across the shivering gulf, Like the breath of young girls from the world\r\n\r\n      still farther north. Beneath the two lighted horizons, sinking and rising\r\n\r\n      at once, The sun rolls rebounding from the gods at the north of the world.\r\n\r\n      In this moment, beloved, when in the clear shadows of this rose-stained\r\n\r\n      evening I am here alone with you, Respond, respond with a heart less timid\r\n\r\n      to the holy, accustomed cry of \u2018Good-evening.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ah, how Boris Nikolaievitch and Michael Korsakoff watched her as she sang!\r\n\r\n      Truly, no one ever can guess the anger or the love that broods in a Slavic\r\n\r\n      heart under a soldier\u2019s tunic, whether the soldier wisely plays at the\r\n\r\n      guzla, as the correct Boris, or merely lounges, twirling his mustache with\r\n\r\n      his manicured and perfumed fingers, like Michael, the indifferent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha ceased singing, but all seemed to be listening to her still\u2014the\r\n\r\n      convivial group on the terrace appeared to be held in charmed attention,\r\n\r\n      and the porcelain statuettes of men on the lawn, according to the mode of\r\n\r\n      the Iles, seemed to lift on their short legs the better to hear pass the\r\n\r\n      sighing harmony of Natacha in the rose nights at the north of the world.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile Matrena wandered through the house from cellar to attic,\r\n\r\n      watching over her husband like a dog on guard, ready to bite, to throw\r\n\r\n      itself in the way of danger, to receive the blows, to die for its master\u2014and\r\n\r\n      hunting for Rouletabille, who had disappeared again.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      III. THE WATCH\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She went out to caution the servants to a strict watch, armed to the\r\n\r\n      teeth, before the gate all night long, and she crossed the deserted\r\n\r\n      garden. Under the veranda the schwitzar was spreading a mattress for\r\n\r\n      Ermolai. She asked him if he had seen the young Frenchman anywhere, and\r\n\r\n      after the answer, could only say to herself, \u201cWhere is he, then?\u201d Where\r\n\r\n      had Rouletabille gone? The general, whom she had carried up to his room on\r\n\r\n      her back, without any help, and had helped into bed without assistance,\r\n\r\n      was disturbed by this singular disappearance. Had someone already carried\r\n\r\n      off \u201ctheir\u201d Rouletabille? Their friends were gone and the orderlies had\r\n\r\n      taken leave without being able to say where this boy of a journalist had\r\n\r\n      gone. But it would be foolish to worry about the disappearance of a\r\n\r\n      Journalist, they had said. That kind of man\u2014these journalists\u2014came,\r\n\r\n      went, arrived when one least expected them, and quitted their company\u2014even\r\n\r\n      the highest society\u2014without formality. It was what they called in\r\n\r\n      France \u201cleaving English fashion.\u201d However, it appeared it was not meant to\r\n\r\n      be impolite. Perhaps he had gone to telegraph. A journalist had to keep in\r\n\r\n      touch with the telegraph at all hours. Poor Matrena Petrovna roamed the\r\n\r\n      solitary garden in tumult of heart. There was the light in the general\u2019s\r\n\r\n      window on the first floor. There were lights in the basement from the\r\n\r\n      kitchens. There was a light on the ground-floor near the sitting-room,\r\n\r\n      from Natacha\u2019s chamber window. Ah, the night was hard to bear. And this\r\n\r\n      night the shadows weighed heavier than ever on the valiant breast of\r\n\r\n      Matrena. As she breathed she felt as though she lifted all the weight of\r\n\r\n      the threatening night. She examined everything\u2014everything. All was\r\n\r\n      shut tight, was perfectly secure, and there was no one within excepting\r\n\r\n      people she was absolutely sure of\u2014but whom, all the same, she did\r\n\r\n      not allow to go anywhere in the house excepting where their work called\r\n\r\n      them. Each in his place. That made things surer. She wished each one could\r\n\r\n      remain fixed like the porcelain statues of men out on the lawn. Even as\r\n\r\n      she thought it, here at her feet, right at her very feet, a shadow of one\r\n\r\n      of the porcelain men moved, stretched itself out, rose to its knees,\r\n\r\n      grasped her skirt and spoke in the voice of Rouletabille. Ah, good! it was\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille. \u201cHimself, dear madame; himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy is Ermolai in the veranda? Send him back to the kitchens and tell the\r\n\r\n      schwitzar to go to bed. The servants are enough for an ordinary guard\r\n\r\n      outside. Then you go in at once, shut the door, and don\u2019t concern yourself\r\n\r\n      about me, dear madame. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had resumed, in the shadows, among the other porcelain\r\n\r\n      figures, his pose of a porcelain man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna did as she was told, returned to the house, spoke to the\r\n\r\n      schwitzar, who removed to the lodge with Ermolai, and their mistress\r\n\r\n      closed the outside door. She had closed long before the door of the\r\n\r\n      kitchen stair which allowed the domestics to enter the villa from below.\r\n\r\n      Down there each night the devoted gniagnia and the faithful Ermolai\r\n\r\n      watched in turn.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Within the villa, now closed, there were on the ground-floor only Matrena\r\n\r\n      herself and her step-daughter Natacha, who slept in the chamber off the\r\n\r\n      sitting-room, and, above on the first floor, the general asleep, or who\r\n\r\n      ought to be asleep if he had taken his potion. Matrena remained in the\r\n\r\n      darkness of the drawing-room, her dark-lantern in her hand. All her nights\r\n\r\n      passed thus, gliding from door to door, from chamber to chamber, watching\r\n\r\n      over the watch of the police, not daring to stop her stealthy promenade\r\n\r\n      even to throw herself on the mattress that she had placed across the\r\n\r\n      doorway of her husband\u2019s chamber. Did she ever sleep? She herself could\r\n\r\n      hardly say. Who else could, then? A tag of sleep here and there, over the\r\n\r\n      arm of a chair, or leaning against the wall, waked always by some noise\r\n\r\n      that she heard or dreamed, some warning, perhaps, that she alone had\r\n\r\n      heard. And to-night, to-night there is Rouletabille\u2019s alert guard to help\r\n\r\n      her, and she feels a little less the aching terror of watchfulness, until\r\n\r\n      there surges back into her mind the recollection that the police are no\r\n\r\n      longer there. Was he right, this young man? Certainly she could not deny\r\n\r\n      that some way she feels more confidence now that the police are gone. She\r\n\r\n      does not have to spend her time watching their shadows in the shadows,\r\n\r\n      searching the darkness, the arm-chairs, the sofas, to rouse them, to\r\n\r\n      appeal in low tones to all they held binding, by their own name and the\r\n\r\n      name of their father, to promise them a bonus that would amount to\r\n\r\n      something if they watched well, to count them in order to know where they\r\n\r\n      all were, and, suddenly, to throw full in their face the ray of light from\r\n\r\n      her little dark-lantern in order to be sure, absolutely sure, that she was\r\n\r\n      face to face with them, one of the police, and not with some other, some\r\n\r\n      other with an infernal machine under his arm. Yes, she surely had less\r\n\r\n      work now that she had no longer to watch the police. And she had less\r\n\r\n      fear!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She thanked the young reporter for that. Where was he? Did he remain in\r\n\r\n      the pose of a porcelain statue all this time out there on the lawn? She\r\n\r\n      peered through the lattice of the veranda shutters and looked anxiously\r\n\r\n      out into the darkened garden. Where could he be? Was that he, down yonder,\r\n\r\n      that crouching black heap with an unlighted pipe in his mouth? No, no.\r\n\r\n      That, she knew well, was the dwarf she genuinely loved, her little\r\n\r\n      domovoi-doukh, the familiar spirit of the house, who watched with her over\r\n\r\n      the general\u2019s life and thanks to whom serious injury had not yet befallen\r\n\r\n      Feodor Feodorovitch\u2014one could not regard a mangled leg that\r\n\r\n      seriously. Ordinarily in her own country (she was from the Orel district)\r\n\r\n      one did not care to see the domovoi-doukh appear in flesh and blood. When\r\n\r\n      she was little she was always afraid that she would come upon him around a\r\n\r\n      turn of the path in her father\u2019s garden. She always thought of him as no\r\n\r\n      higher than that, seated back on his haunches and smoking his pipe. Then,\r\n\r\n      after she was married, she had suddenly run across him at a turning in the\r\n\r\n      bazaar at Moscow. He was just as she had imagined him, and she had\r\n\r\n      immediately bought him, carried him home herself and placed him, with many\r\n\r\n      precautions, for he was of very delicate porcelain, in the vestibule of\r\n\r\n      the palace. And in leaving Moscow she had been careful not to leave him\r\n\r\n      there. She had carried him herself in a case and had placed him herself on\r\n\r\n      the lawn of the datcha des Iles, that he might continue to watch over her\r\n\r\n      happiness and over the life of her Feodor. And in order that he should not\r\n\r\n      be bored, eternally smoking his pipe all alone, she had surrounded him\r\n\r\n      with a group of little porcelain genii, after the fashion of the Jardins\r\n\r\n      des Iles. Lord! how that young Frenchman had frightened her, rising\r\n\r\n      suddenly like that, without warning, on the lawn. She had believed for a\r\n\r\n      moment that it was the domovoi-doukh himself rising to stretch his legs.\r\n\r\n      Happily he had spoken at once and she had recognized his voice. And\r\n\r\n      besides, her domovoi surely would not speak French. Ah! Matrena Petrovna\r\n\r\n      breathed freely now. It seemed to her, this night, that there were two\r\n\r\n      little familiar genii watching over the house. And that was worth more\r\n\r\n      than all the police in the world, surely. How wily that little fellow was\r\n\r\n      to order all those men away. There was something it was necessary to know;\r\n\r\n      it was necessary therefore that nothing should be in the way of learning\r\n\r\n      it. As things were now, the mystery could operate without suspicion or\r\n\r\n      interference. Only one man watched it, and he had not the air of watching.\r\n\r\n      Certainly Rouletabille had not the air of constantly watching anything. He\r\n\r\n      had the manner, out in the night, of an easy little man in porcelain,\r\n\r\n      neither more nor less, yet he could see everything\u2014if anything were\r\n\r\n      there to see\u2014and he could hear everything\u2014if there were\r\n\r\n      anything to hear. One passed beside him without suspecting him, and men\r\n\r\n      might talk to each other without an idea that he heard them, and even talk\r\n\r\n      to themselves according to the habit people have sometimes when they think\r\n\r\n      themselves quite alone. All the guests had departed thus, passing close by\r\n\r\n      him, almost brushing him, had exchanged their \u201cAdieus,\u201d their \u201cAu\r\n\r\n      revoirs,\u201d and all their final, drawn-out farewells. That dear little\r\n\r\n      living domovoi certainly was a rogue! Oh, that dear little domovoi who had\r\n\r\n      been so affected by the tears of Matrena Petrovna! The good, fat,\r\n\r\n      sentimental, heroic woman longed to hear, just then, his reassuring voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is I. Here I am,\u201d said the voice of her little living familiar spirit\r\n\r\n      at that instant, and she felt her skirt grasped. She waited for what he\r\n\r\n      should say. She felt no fear. Yet she had supposed he was outside the\r\n\r\n      house. Still, after all, she was not too astonished that he was within. He\r\n\r\n      was so adroit! He had entered behind her, in the shadow of her skirts, on\r\n\r\n      all-fours, and had slipped away without anyone noticing him, while she was\r\n\r\n      speaking to her enormous, majestic schwitzar.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo you were here?\u201d she said, taking his hand and pressing it nervously in\r\n\r\n      hers.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes. I have watched you closing the house. It is a task well-done,\r\n\r\n      certainly. You have not forgotten anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut where were you, dear little demon? I have been into all the corners,\r\n\r\n      and my hands did not touch you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was under the table set with hors-d\u2019oeuvres in the sitting-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, under the table of zakouskis! I have forbidden them before now to\r\n\r\n      spread a long hanging cloth there, which obliges me to kick my foot\r\n\r\n      underneath casually in order to be sure there is no one beneath. It is\r\n\r\n      imprudent, very imprudent, such table-cloths. And under the table of\r\n\r\n      zakouskis have you been able to see or hear anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, do you think that anyone could possibly see or hear anything in\r\n\r\n      the villa when you are watching it alone, when the general is asleep and\r\n\r\n      your step-daughter is preparing for bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo. No. I do not believe so. I do not. No, oh, Christ!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They talked thus very low in the dark, both seated in a corner of the\r\n\r\n      sofa, Rouletabille\u2019s hand held tightly in the burning hands of Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She sighed anxiously. \u201cAnd in the garden\u2014have you heard anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI heard the officer Boris say to the officer Michael, in French, \u2018Shall\r\n\r\n      we return at once to the villa?\u2019 The other replied in Russian in a way I\r\n\r\n      could see was a refusal. Then they had a discussion in Russian which I,\r\n\r\n      naturally, could not understand. But from the way they talked I gathered\r\n\r\n      that they disagreed and that no love was lost between them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, they do not love each other. They both love Natacha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd she, which one of them does she love? It is necessary to tell me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe pretends that she loves Boris, and I believe she does, and yet she is\r\n\r\n      very friendly with Michael and often she goes into nooks and corners to\r\n\r\n      chat with him, which makes Boris mad with jealousy. She has forbidden\r\n\r\n      Boris to speak to her father about their marriage, on the pretext that she\r\n\r\n      does not wish to leave her father now, while each day, each minute the\r\n\r\n      general\u2019s life is in danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you, madame\u2014do you love your step-daughter?\u201d brutally inquired\r\n\r\n      the reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes\u2014sincerely,\u201d replied Matrena Petrovna, withdrawing her hand from\r\n\r\n      those of Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd she\u2014does she love you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe so, monsieur, I believe so sincerely. Yes, she loves me, and\r\n\r\n      there is not any reason why she should not love me. I believe\u2014understand\r\n\r\n      me thoroughly, because it comes from my heart\u2014that we all here in\r\n\r\n      this house love one another. Our friends are old proved friends. Boris has\r\n\r\n      been orderly to my husband for a very long time. We do not share any of\r\n\r\n      his too-modern ideas, and there were many discussions on the duty of\r\n\r\n      soldiers at the time of the massacres. I reproached him with being as\r\n\r\n      womanish as we were in going down on his knees to the general behind\r\n\r\n      Natacha and me, when it became necessary to kill all those poor moujiks of\r\n\r\n      Presnia. It was not his role. A soldier is a soldier. My husband raised\r\n\r\n      him roughly and ordered him, for his pains, to march at the head of the\r\n\r\n      troops. It was right. What else could he do? The general already had\r\n\r\n      enough to fight against, with the whole revolution, with his conscience,\r\n\r\n      with the natural pity in his heart of a brave man, and with the tears and\r\n\r\n      insupportable moanings, at such a moment, of his daughter and his wife.\r\n\r\n      Boris understood and obeyed him, but, after the death of the poor\r\n\r\n      students, he behaved again like a woman in composing those verses on the\r\n\r\n      heroes of the barricades; don\u2019t you think so? Verses that Natacha and he\r\n\r\n      learned by heart, working together, when they were surprised at it by the\r\n\r\n      general. There was a terrible scene. It was before the next-to-the-last\r\n\r\n      attack. The general then had the use of both legs. He stamped his feet and\r\n\r\n      fairly shook the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201ca propos of the attacks, you must tell me\r\n\r\n      about the third.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As he said this, leaning toward her, Matrena Petrovna ejaculated a\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen!\u201d that made him rigid in the night with ear alert. What had she\r\n\r\n      heard? For him, he had heard nothing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou hear nothing?\u201d she whispered to him with an effort. \u201cA tick-tack?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I hear nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know\u2014like the tick-tack of a clock. Listen.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow can you hear the tick-tack? I\u2019ve noticed that no clocks are running\r\n\r\n      here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? It is so that we shall be able to hear the\r\n\r\n      tick-tack better.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, yes, I understand. But I do not hear anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor myself, I think I hear the tick-tack all the time since the last\r\n\r\n      attempt. It haunts my ears, it is frightful, to say to one\u2019s self: There\r\n\r\n      is clockwork somewhere, just about to reach the death-tick\u2014and not\r\n\r\n      to know where, not to know where! When the police were here I made them\r\n\r\n      all listen, and I was not sure even when they had all listened and said\r\n\r\n      there was no tick-tack. It is terrible to hear it in my ear any moment\r\n\r\n      when I least expect it. Tick-tack! Tick-tack! It is the blood beating in\r\n\r\n      my ear, for instance, hard, as if it struck on a sounding-board. Why, here\r\n\r\n      are drops of perspiration on my hands! Listen!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, this time someone is talking\u2014is crying,\u201d said the young man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSh-h-h!\u201d And Rouletabille felt the rigid hand of Matrena Petrovna on his\r\n\r\n      arm. \u201cIt is the general. The general is dreaming!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She drew him into the dining-room, into a corner where they could no\r\n\r\n      longer hear the moanings. But all the doors that communicated with the\r\n\r\n      dining-room, the drawing-room and the sitting-room remained open behind\r\n\r\n      him, by the secret precaution of Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He waited while Matrena, whose breath he heard come hard, was a little\r\n\r\n      behind. In a moment, quite talkative, and as though she wished to distract\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s attention from the sounds above, the broken words and\r\n\r\n      sighs, she continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSee, you speak of clocks. My husband has a watch which strikes. Well, I\r\n\r\n      have stopped his watch because more than once I have been startled by\r\n\r\n      hearing the tick-tack of his watch in his waistcoat-pocket. Koupriane gave\r\n\r\n      me that advice one day when he was here and had pricked his ears at the\r\n\r\n      noise of the pendulums, to stop all my watches and clocks so that there\r\n\r\n      would be no chance of confusing them with the tick-tack that might come\r\n\r\n      from an infernal machine planted in some corner. He spoke from experience,\r\n\r\n      my dear little monsieur, and it was by his order that all the clocks at\r\n\r\n      the Ministry, on the Naberjnaia, were stopped, my dear little friend. The\r\n\r\n      Nihilists, he told me, often use clockworks to set off their machines at\r\n\r\n      the time they decide on. No one can guess all the inventions that they\r\n\r\n      have, those brigands. In the same way, Koupriane advised me to take away\r\n\r\n      all the draught-boards from the fireplaces. By that precaution they were\r\n\r\n      enabled to avoid a terrible disaster at the Ministry near the\r\n\r\n      Pont-des-chantres, you know, petit demovoi? They saw a bomb just as it was\r\n\r\n      being lowered into the fire-place of the minister\u2019s cabinet.* The\r\n\r\n      Nihilists held it by a cord and were up on the roof letting it down the\r\n\r\n      chimney. One of them was caught, taken to Schlusselbourg and hanged. Here\r\n\r\n      you can see that all the draught-boards of the fireplaces are cleared\r\n\r\n      away.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame,\u201d interrupted Rouletabille (Matrena Petrovna did not know that no\r\n\r\n      one ever succeeded in distracting Rouletabille\u2019s attention), \u201cmadame,\r\n\r\n      someone moans still, upstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, that is nothing, my little friend. It is the general, who has bad\r\n\r\n      nights. He cannot sleep without a narcotic, and that gives him a fever. I\r\n\r\n      am going to tell you now how the third attack came about. And then you\r\n\r\n      will understand, by the Virgin Mary, how it is I have yet, always have,\r\n\r\n      the tick-tack in my ears.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOne evening when the general had got to sleep and I was in my own room, I\r\n\r\n      heard distinctly the tick-tack of clockwork operating. All the clocks had\r\n\r\n      been stopped, as Koupriane advised, and I had made an excuse to send\r\n\r\n      Feodor\u2019s great watch to the repairer. You can understand how I felt when I\r\n\r\n      heard that tick-tack. I was frenzied. I turned my head in all directions,\r\n\r\n      and decided that the sound came from my husband\u2019s chamber. I ran there. He\r\n\r\n      still slept, man that he is! The tick-tack was there. But where? I turned\r\n\r\n      here and there like a fool. The chamber was in darkness and it seemed\r\n\r\n      absolutely impossible for me to light a lamp because I thought I could not\r\n\r\n      take the time for fear the infernal machine would go off in those few\r\n\r\n      seconds. I threw myself on the floor and listened under the bed. The noise\r\n\r\n      came from above. But where? I sprang to the fireplace, hoping that,\r\n\r\n      against my orders, someone had started the mantel-clock. No, it was not\r\n\r\n      that! It seemed to me now that the tick-tack came from the bed itself,\r\n\r\n      that the machine was in the bed. The general awaked just then and cried to\r\n\r\n      me, \u2018What is it, Matrena? What are you doing?\u2019 And he raised himself in\r\n\r\n      bed, while I cried, \u2018Listen! Hear the tick-tack. Don\u2019t you hear the\r\n\r\n      tick-tack?\u2019 I threw myself upon him and gathered him up in my arms to\r\n\r\n      carry him, but I trembled too much, was too weak from fear, and fell back\r\n\r\n      with him onto the bed, crying, \u2018Help!\u2019 He thrust me away and said roughly,\r\n\r\n      \u2018Listen.\u2019 The frightful tick-tack was behind us now, on the table. But\r\n\r\n      there was nothing on the table, only the night-light, the glass with the\r\n\r\n      potion in it, and a gold vase where I had placed with my own hands that\r\n\r\n      morning a cluster of grasses and wild flowers that Ermolai had brought\r\n\r\n      that morning on his return from the Orel country. With one bound I was on\r\n\r\n      the table and at the flowers. I struck my fingers among the grasses and\r\n\r\n      the flowers, and felt a resistance. The tick-tack was in the bouquet! I\r\n\r\n      took the bouquet in both hands, opened the window and threw it as far as I\r\n\r\n      could into the garden. At the same moment the bomb burst with a terrible\r\n\r\n      noise, giving me quite a deep wound in the hand. Truly, my dear little\r\n\r\n      domovoi, that day we had been very near death, but God and the Little\r\n\r\n      Father watched over us.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Matrena Petrovna made the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll the windows of the house were broken. In all, we escaped with the\r\n\r\n      fright and a visit from the glazier, my little friend, but I certainly\r\n\r\n      believed that all was over.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd Mademoiselle Natacha?\u201d inquired Rouletabille. \u201cShe must also have\r\n\r\n      been terribly frightened, because the whole house must have rocked.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSurely. But Natacha was not here that night. It was a Saturday. She had\r\n\r\n      been invited to the soiree du \u2018Michel\u2019 by the parents of Boris\r\n\r\n      Nikolaievitch, and she slept at their house, after supper at the Ours, as\r\n\r\n      had been planned. The next day, when she learned the danger the general\r\n\r\n      had escaped, she trembled in every limb. She threw herself in her father\u2019s\r\n\r\n      arms, weeping, which was natural enough, and declared that she never would\r\n\r\n      go away from him again. The general told her how I had managed. Then she\r\n\r\n      pressed me to her heart, saying that she never would forget such an\r\n\r\n      action, and that she loved me more than if I were truly her mother. It was\r\n\r\n      all in vain that during the days following we sought to understand how the\r\n\r\n      infernal machine had been placed in the bouquet of wild flowers. Only the\r\n\r\n      general\u2019s friends that you saw this evening, Natacha and I had entered the\r\n\r\n      general\u2019s chamber during the day or in the evening. No servant, no\r\n\r\n      chamber-maid, had been on that floor. In the day-time as well as all night\r\n\r\n      long that entire floor is closed and I have the keys. The door of the\r\n\r\n      servants\u2019 staircase which opens onto that floor, directly into the\r\n\r\n      general\u2019s chamber, is always locked and barred on the inside with iron.\r\n\r\n      Natacha and I do the chamber work. There is no way of taking greater\r\n\r\n      precautions. Three police agents watched over us night and day. The night\r\n\r\n      of the bouquet two had spent their time watching around the house, and the\r\n\r\n      third lay on the sofa in the veranda. Then, too, we found all the doors\r\n\r\n      and windows of the villa shut tight. In such circumstances you can judge\r\n\r\n      whether my anguish was not deeper than any I had known hitherto. Because\r\n\r\n      to whom, henceforth, could we trust ourselves? what and whom could we\r\n\r\n      believe? what and whom could we watch? From that day, no other person but\r\n\r\n      Natacha and me have the right to go to the first floor. The general\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber was forbidden to his friends. Anyway, the general improved, and\r\n\r\n      soon had the pleasure of receiving them himself at his table. I carry the\r\n\r\n      general down and take him to his room again on my back. I do not wish\r\n\r\n      anyone to help. I am strong enough for that. I feel that I could carry him\r\n\r\n      to the end of the world if that would save him. Instead of three police,\r\n\r\n      we had ten; five outside, five inside. The days went well enough, but the\r\n\r\n      nights were frightful, because the shadows of the police that I\r\n\r\n      encountered always made me fear that I was face to face with the\r\n\r\n      Nihilists. One night I almost strangled one with my hand. It was after\r\n\r\n      that incident that we arranged with Koupriane that the agents who watched\r\n\r\n      at night, inside, should stay placed in the veranda, after having, at the\r\n\r\n      end of the evening, made complete examination of everything. They were not\r\n\r\n      to leave the veranda unless they heard a suspicious noise or I called to\r\n\r\n      them. And it was after that arrangement that the incident of the floor\r\n\r\n      happened, that has puzzled so both Koupriane and me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon, madame,\u201d interrupted Rouletabille, \u201cbut the agents, during the\r\n\r\n      examination of everything, never went to the bedroom floor?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, my child, there is only myself and Natacha, I repeat, who, since the\r\n\r\n      bouquet, go there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, madame, it is necessary to take me there at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt once!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, into the general\u2019s chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut he is sleeping, my child. Let me tell you exactly how the affair of\r\n\r\n      the floor happened, and you will know as much of it as I and as\r\n\r\n      Koupriane.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo the general\u2019s chamber at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She took both his hands and pressed them nervously. \u201cLittle friend! Little\r\n\r\n      friend! One hears there sometimes things which are the secret of the\r\n\r\n      night! You understand me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo the general\u2019s chamber, at once, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Abruptly she decided to take him there, agitated, upset as she was by\r\n\r\n      ideas and sentiments which held her without respite between the wildest\r\n\r\n      inquietude and the most imprudent audacity.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      IV. \u201cTHE YOUTH OF MOSCOW IS DEAD\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille let himself be led by Matrena through the night, but he\r\n\r\n      stumbled and his awkward hands struck against various things. The ascent\r\n\r\n      to the first floor was accomplished in profound silence. Nothing broke it\r\n\r\n      except that restless moaning which had so affected the young man just\r\n\r\n      before.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The tepid warmth, the perfume of a woman\u2019s boudoir, then, beyond, through\r\n\r\n      two doors opening upon the dressing-room which lay between Matrena\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber and Feodor\u2019s, the dim luster of a night-lamp showed the bed where\r\n\r\n      was stretched the sleeping tyrant of Moscow. Ah, he was frightening to\r\n\r\n      see, with the play of faint yellow light and diffused shadows upon him.\r\n\r\n      Such heavy-arched eyebrows, such an aspect of pain and menace, the massive\r\n\r\n      jaw of a savage come from the plains of Tartary to be the Scourge of God,\r\n\r\n      the stiff, thick, spreading beard. This was a form akin to the gallery of\r\n\r\n      old nobles at Kasan, and young Rouletabille imagined him as none other\r\n\r\n      than Ivan the Terrible himself. Thus appeared as he slept the excellent\r\n\r\n      Feodor Feodorovitch, the easy, spoiled father of the family table, the\r\n\r\n      friend of the advocate celebrated for his feats with knife and fork and of\r\n\r\n      the bantering timber-merchant and amiable bear-hunter, the joyous Thaddeus\r\n\r\n      and Athanase; Feodor, the faithful spouse of Matrena Petrovna and the\r\n\r\n      adored papa of Natacha, a brave man who was so unfortunate as to have\r\n\r\n      nights of cruel sleeplessness or dreams more frightful still.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment a hoarse sigh heaved his huge chest in an uneven rhythm,\r\n\r\n      and Rouletabille, leaning in the doorway of the dressing-room, watched\u2014but\r\n\r\n      it was no longer the general that he watched, it was something else, lower\r\n\r\n      down, beside the wall, near the door, and it was that which set him\r\n\r\n      tiptoeing so lightly across the floor that it gave no sound. There was no\r\n\r\n      slightest sound in the chamber, except the heavy breathing lifting the\r\n\r\n      rough chest. Behind Rouletabille Matrena raised her arms, as though she\r\n\r\n      wished to hold him back, because she did not know where he was going. What\r\n\r\n      was he doing? Why did he stoop thus beside the door and why did he press\r\n\r\n      his thumb all along the floor at the doorway? He rose again and returned.\r\n\r\n      He passed again before the bed, where rumbled now, like the bellows of a\r\n\r\n      forge, the respiration of the sleeper. Matrena grasped Rouletabille by the\r\n\r\n      hand. And she had already hurried him into the dressing-room when a moan\r\n\r\n      stopped them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe youth of Moscow is dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was the sleeper speaking. The mouth which had given the stringent\r\n\r\n      orders moaned. And the lamentation was still a menace. In the haunted\r\n\r\n      sleep thrust upon that man by the inadequate narcotic the words Feodor\r\n\r\n      Feodorovitch spoke were words of mourning and pity. This perfect fiend of\r\n\r\n      a soldier, whom neither bullets nor bombs could intimidate, had a way of\r\n\r\n      saying words which transformed their meaning as they came from his\r\n\r\n      terrible mouth. The listeners could not but feel absorbed in the tones of\r\n\r\n      the brutal victor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna and Rouletabille had leant their two shadows, blended one\r\n\r\n      into the other, against the open doorway just beyond the gleam of the\r\n\r\n      night-lamp, and they heard with horror:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe youth of Moscow is dead! They have cleared away the corpses. There is\r\n\r\n      nothing but ruin left. The Kremlin itself has shut its gates\u2014that it\r\n\r\n      may not see. The youth of Moscow is dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Feodor Feodorovitch\u2019s fist shook above his bed; it seemed that he was\r\n\r\n      about to strike, to kill again, and Rouletabille felt Matrena trembling\r\n\r\n      against him, while he trembled as well before the fearful vision of the\r\n\r\n      killer in the Red Week!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Feodor heaved an immense sigh and his breast descended under the\r\n\r\n      bed-clothes, the fist relaxed and fell, the great head lay over on its\r\n\r\n      ear. There was silence. Had he repose at last? No, no. He sighed, he\r\n\r\n      choked anew, he tossed on his couch like the damned in torment, and the\r\n\r\n      words written by his daughter\u2014by his daughter\u2014blazed in his\r\n\r\n      eyes, which now were wide open\u2014words written on the wall, that he\r\n\r\n      read on the wall, written in blood.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But\u2014what? The voice of Feodor lost its threatening tone. His breath\r\n\r\n      came as from a weeping child. And it was with sobs in his throat that he\r\n\r\n      said the last verse, the verse written by his daughter in the album, in\r\n\r\n      red letters:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFeodor! Feodor!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She had caught him in her arms, holding him fast, comforting him while\r\n\r\n      still he raved, \u201cThe youth of Moscow is dead,\u201d and appeared to thrust away\r\n\r\n      with insensate gestures a crowd of phantoms. She crushed him to her\r\n\r\n      breast, she put her hands over his mouth to make him stop, but he, saying,\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you hear? Do you hear? What do they say? They say nothing, now. What a\r\n\r\n      tangle of bodies under the sleigh, Matrena! Look at those frozen legs of\r\n\r\n      those poor girls we pass, sticking out in all directions, like logs, from\r\n\r\n      under their icy, blooded skirts. Look, Matrena!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And then came further delirium uttered in Russian, which was all the more\r\n\r\n      terrible to Rouletabille because he could not comprehend it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, suddenly, Feodor became silent and thrust away Matrena Petrovna.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is that abominable narcotic,\u201d he said with an immense sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll\r\n\r\n      drink no more of it. I do not wish to drink it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      With one hand he pointed to a large glass on the table beside him, still\r\n\r\n      half full of a soporific mixture with which he moistened his lips each\r\n\r\n      time he woke; with the other hand he wiped the perspiration from his face.\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna stayed trembling near him, suddenly overpowered by the\r\n\r\n      idea that he might discover there was someone there behind the door, who\r\n\r\n      had seen and heard the sleep of General Trebassof! Ah, if he learned that,\r\n\r\n      everything was over. She might say her prayers; she should die.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Rouletabille was careful to give no sign. He barely breathed. What a\r\n\r\n      nightmare! He understood now the emotion of the general\u2019s friends when\r\n\r\n      Natacha had sung in her low, sweet voice, \u201cGood-night. May your eyes have\r\n\r\n      rest from tears and calm re-enter your heart oppressed.\u201d The friends had\r\n\r\n      certainly been made aware, by Matrena\u2019s anxious talking, of the general\u2019s\r\n\r\n      insomnia, and they could not repress their tears as they listened to the\r\n\r\n      poetic wish of charming Natacha. \u201cAll the same,\u201d thought Rouletabille, \u201cno\r\n\r\n      one could imagine what I have just seen. They are not dead for everyone in\r\n\r\n      the world, the youths of Moscow, and every night I know now a chamber\r\n\r\n      where in the glow of the night-lamp they rise\u2014they rise\u2014they\r\n\r\n      rise!\u201d and the young man frankly, naively regretted to have intruded where\r\n\r\n      he was; to have penetrated, however unintentionally, into an affair which,\r\n\r\n      after all, concerned only the many dead and the one living. Why had he\r\n\r\n      come to put himself between the dead and the living? It might be said to\r\n\r\n      him: \u201cThe living has done his whole heroic duty,\u201d but the dead, what else\r\n\r\n      was it that they had done?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ah, Rouletabille cursed his curiosity, for\u2014he saw it now\u2014it\r\n\r\n      was the desire to approach the mystery revealed by Koupriane and to\r\n\r\n      penetrate once more, through all the besetting dangers, an astounding and\r\n\r\n      perhaps monstrous enigma, that had brought him to the threshold of the\r\n\r\n      datcha des Iles, which had placed him in the trembling hands of Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna in promising her his help. He had shown pity, certainly, pity for\r\n\r\n      the delirious distress of that heroic woman. But there had been more\r\n\r\n      curiosity than pity in his motives. And now he must pay, because it was\r\n\r\n      too late now to withdraw, to say casually, \u201cI wash my hands of it.\u201d He had\r\n\r\n      sent away the police and he alone remained between the general and the\r\n\r\n      vengeance of the dead! He might desert, perhaps! That one idea brought him\r\n\r\n      to himself, roused all his spirit. Circumstances had brought him into a\r\n\r\n      camp that he must defend at any cost, unless he was afraid!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general slept now, or, at least, with eyelids closed simulated sleep,\r\n\r\n      doubtless in order to reassure poor Matrena who, on her knees beside his\r\n\r\n      pillow, had retained the hand of her terrible husband in her own. Shortly\r\n\r\n      she rose and rejoined Rouletabille in her chamber. She took him then to a\r\n\r\n      little guest-chamber where she urged him to get some sleep. He replied\r\n\r\n      that it was she who needed rest. But, agitated still by what had just\r\n\r\n      happened, she babbled:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no! after such a scene I would have nightmares myself as well. Ah, it\r\n\r\n      is dreadful! Appalling! Appalling! Dear little monsieur, it is the secret\r\n\r\n      of the night. The poor man! Poor unhappy man! He cannot tear his thoughts\r\n\r\n      away from it. It is his worst and unmerited punishment, this translation\r\n\r\n      that Natacha has made of Boris\u2019s abominable verses. He knows them by\r\n\r\n      heart, they are in his brain and on his tongue all night long, in spite of\r\n\r\n      narcotics, and he says over and over again all the time, \u2018It is my\r\n\r\n      daughter who has written that!\u2014my daughter!\u2014my daughter!\u2019 It\r\n\r\n      is enough to wring all the tears from one\u2019s body\u2014that an aide-de-camp\r\n\r\n      of a general, who himself has killed the youth of Moscow, is allowed to\r\n\r\n      write such verses and that Natacha should take it upon herself to\r\n\r\n      translate them into lovely poetic French for her album. It is hard to\r\n\r\n      account for what they do nowadays, to our misery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She ceased, for just then they heard the floor creak under a step\r\n\r\n      downstairs. Rouletabille stopped Matrena short and drew his revolver. He\r\n\r\n      wished to creep down alone, but he had not time. As the floor creaked a\r\n\r\n      second time, Matrena\u2019s anguished voice called down the staircase in\r\n\r\n      Russian, \u201cWho is there?\u201d and immediately the calm voice of Natacha\r\n\r\n      answered something in the same language. Then Matrena, trembling more and\r\n\r\n      more, and very much excited keeping steadily to the same place as though\r\n\r\n      she had been nailed to the step of the stairway, said in French, \u201cYes, all\r\n\r\n      is well; your father is resting. Good-night, Natacha.\u201d They heard\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s step cross the drawing-room and the sitting-room. Then the door\r\n\r\n      of her chamber closed. Matrena and Rouletabille descended, holding their\r\n\r\n      breath. They reached the dining-room and Matrena played her dark-lantern\r\n\r\n      on the sofa where the general always reclined. The sofa was in its usual\r\n\r\n      place on the carpet. She pushed it back and raised the carpet, laying the\r\n\r\n      floor bare. Then she got onto her knees and examined the floor minutely.\r\n\r\n      She rose, wiping the perspiration from her brow, put the carpet hack in\r\n\r\n      place, adjusted the sofa and dropped upon it with a great sigh.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d demanded Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing at all,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy did you call so openly?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause there was no doubt that it could only be my step-daughter on the\r\n\r\n      ground-floor at that hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd why this anxiety to examine the floor again?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI entreat you, my dear little child, do not see in my acts anything\r\n\r\n      mysterious, anything hard to explain. That anxiety you speak of never\r\n\r\n      leaves me. Whenever I have the chance I examine the flooring.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame,\u201d demanded the young man, \u201cwhat was your daughter doing in this\r\n\r\n      room?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe came for a glass of mineral water; the bottle is still on the table.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, it is necessary that you tell me precisely what Koupriane has\r\n\r\n      only hinted to me, unless I am entirely mistaken. The first time that you\r\n\r\n      thought to examine the floor, was it after you heard a noise on the\r\n\r\n      ground-floor such as has just happened?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. I will tell you all that is necessary. It was the night after the\r\n\r\n      attempt with the bouquet, my dear little monsieur, my dear little domovoi;\r\n\r\n      it seemed to me I heard a noise on the ground-floor. I hurried downstairs\r\n\r\n      and saw nothing suspicious at first. Everything was shut tight. I opened\r\n\r\n      the door of Natacha\u2019s chamber softly. I wished to ask her if she had heard\r\n\r\n      anything. But she was so fast asleep that I had not the heart to awaken\r\n\r\n      her. I opened the door of the veranda, and all the police\u2014all, you\r\n\r\n      understand\u2014slept soundly. I took another turn around the furniture,\r\n\r\n      and, with my lantern in my hand, I was just going out of the dining-room\r\n\r\n      when I noticed that the carpet on the floor was disarranged at one corner.\r\n\r\n      I got down and my hand struck a great fold of carpet near the general\u2019s\r\n\r\n      sofa. You would have said that the sofa had been rolled carelessly, trying\r\n\r\n      to replace it in the position it usually occupied. Prompted by a sinister\r\n\r\n      presentiment, I pushed away the sofa and I lifted the carpet. At first\r\n\r\n      glance I saw nothing, but when I examined things closer I saw that a strip\r\n\r\n      of wood did not lie well with the others on the floor. With a knife I was\r\n\r\n      able to lift that strip and I found that two nails which had fastened it\r\n\r\n      to the beam below had been freshly pulled out. It was just so I could\r\n\r\n      raise the end of the board a little without being able to slip my hand\r\n\r\n      under. To lift it any more it would be necessary to pull at least\r\n\r\n      half-a-dozen nails. What could it mean? Was I on the point of discovering\r\n\r\n      some new terrible and mysterious plan? I let the board fall back into\r\n\r\n      place. I spread the carpet back again carefully, put the sofa in its\r\n\r\n      place, and in the morning sent for Koupriane.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille interrupted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou had not, madame, spoken to anyone of this discovery?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo no one.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot even to your step-daughter?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said the husky voice of Matrena, \u201cnot even to my step-daughter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy?\u201d demanded Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause,\u201d replied Matrena, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, \u201cthere were\r\n\r\n      already enough frightening things about the house. I would not have spoken\r\n\r\n      to my daughter any more than I would have said a word to the general. Why\r\n\r\n      add to the disquiet they already suffered so much, in case nothing\r\n\r\n      developed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what did Koupriane say?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe examined the floor together, secretly. Koupriane slipped his hand\r\n\r\n      under more easily than I had done, and ascertained that under the board,\r\n\r\n      that is to say between the beam and the ceiling of the kitchen, there was\r\n\r\n      a hollow where any number of things might be placed. For the moment the\r\n\r\n      board was still too little released for any maneuver to be possible.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane, when he rose, said to me, \u2018You have happened, madame, to\r\n\r\n      interrupt the person in her operations. But we are prepared henceforth. We\r\n\r\n      know what she does and she is unaware that we know. Act as though you had\r\n\r\n      not noticed anything; do not speak of it to anyone whatever\u2014and\r\n\r\n      watch. Let the general continue to sit in his usual place and let no one\r\n\r\n      suspect that we have discovered the beginnings of this attempt. It is the\r\n\r\n      only way we can plan so that they will continue. All the same,\u2019 he added,\r\n\r\n      \u2018I will give my agents orders to patrol the ground-floor anew during the\r\n\r\n      night. I would be risking too much to let the person continue her work\r\n\r\n      each night. She might continue it so well that she would be able to\r\n\r\n      accomplish it\u2014you understand me? But by day you arrange that the\r\n\r\n      rooms on the ground-floor be free from time to time\u2014not for long,\r\n\r\n      but from time to time.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why, but what he said and the way he\r\n\r\n      said it frightened me more than ever. However, I carried out his program.\r\n\r\n      Then, three days later, about eight o\u2019clock, when the night watch was not\r\n\r\n      yet started, that is to say at the moment when the police were still all\r\n\r\n      out in the garden or walking around the house, outside, and when I had\r\n\r\n      left the the ground-floor perfectly free while I helped the general to\r\n\r\n      bed, I felt drawn even against myself suddenly to the dining-room. I\r\n\r\n      lifted the carpet and examined the floor. Three more nails had been drawn\r\n\r\n      from the board, which lifted more easily now, and under it, I could see\r\n\r\n      that the normal cavity had been made wider still!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      When she had said this, Matrena stopped, as if, overcome, she could not\r\n\r\n      tell more.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d insisted Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I replaced things as I found them and made rapid inquiries of the\r\n\r\n      police and their chief; no one had entered the ground-floor. You\r\n\r\n      understand me?\u2014no one at all. Neither had anyone come out from it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow could anyone come out if no one had entered?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI wish to say,\u201d said she with a sob, \u201cthat Natacha during this space of\r\n\r\n      time had been in her chamber, in her chamber on the ground-floor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou appear to be very disturbed, madame, at this recollection. Can you\r\n\r\n      tell me further, and precisely, why you are agitated?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou understand me, surely,\u201d she said, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I understand you correctly, I have to understand that from the\r\n\r\n      previous time you examined the floor until the time that you noted three\r\n\r\n      more nails drawn out, no other person could have entered the dining-room\r\n\r\n      but you and your step-daughter Natacha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena took Rouletabille\u2019s hand as though she had reached an important\r\n\r\n      decision.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy little friend,\u201d moaned she, \u201cthere are things I am not able to think\r\n\r\n      about and which I can no longer entertain when Natacha embraces me. It is\r\n\r\n      a mystery more frightful than all else. Koupriane tells me that he is\r\n\r\n      sure, absolutely sure, of the agents he kept here; my sole consolation, do\r\n\r\n      you see, my little friend can tell you frankly, now that you have sent\r\n\r\n      away those men\u2014my sole consolation since that day has been that\r\n\r\n      Koupriane is less sure of his men than I am of Natacha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She broke down and sobbed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When she was calmed, she looked for Rouletabille, and could not find him.\r\n\r\n      Then she wiped her eyes, picked up her dark-lantern, and, furtively, crept\r\n\r\n      to her post beside the general.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      For that day these are the points in Rouletabille\u2019s notebook:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTopography: Villa surrounded by a large garden on three sides. The fourth\r\n\r\n      side gives directly onto a wooded field that stretches to the river Neva.\r\n\r\n      On this side the level of the ground is much lower, so low that the sole\r\n\r\n      window opening in that wall (the window of Natacha\u2019s sitting-room on the\r\n\r\n      ground-floor) is as high from the ground as though it were on the next\r\n\r\n      floor in any other part of the house. This window is closed by iron\r\n\r\n      shutters, fastened inside by a bar of iron.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFriends: Athanase Georgevitch, Ivan Petrovitch, Thaddeus the\r\n\r\n      timber-merchant (peat boots), Michael and Boris (fine shoes). Matrena,\r\n\r\n      sincere love, blundering heroism. Natacha unknown. Against Natacha: Never\r\n\r\n      there during the attacks. At Moscow at the time of the bomb in the sleigh,\r\n\r\n      no one knows where she was, and it is she who should have accompanied the\r\n\r\n      general (detail furnished by Koupriane that Matrena generously kept back).\r\n\r\n      The night of the bouquet is the only night Natacha has slept away from the\r\n\r\n      house. Coincidence of the disappearance of the nails and the presence all\r\n\r\n      alone on the ground-floor of Natacha, in case, of course, Matrena did not\r\n\r\n      pull them out herself. For Natacha: Her eyes when she looks at her\r\n\r\n      father.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And this bizarre phrase:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe mustn\u2019t be rash. This evening I have not yet spoken to Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna about the little hat-pin. That little hat-pin is the greatest\r\n\r\n      relief of my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      V. BY ROULETABILLE\u2019S ORDER THE GENERAL PROMENADES\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood morning, my dear little familiar spirit. The general slept\r\n\r\n      splendidly the latter part of the night. He did not touch his narcotic. I\r\n\r\n      am sure it is that dreadful mixture that gives him such frightful dreams.\r\n\r\n      And you, my dear little friend, you have not slept an instant. I know it.\r\n\r\n      I felt you going everywhere about the house like a little mouse. Ah, it\r\n\r\n      seems good, so good. I slept so peacefully, hearing the subdued movement\r\n\r\n      of your little steps. Thanks for the sleep you have given me, little\r\n\r\n      friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena talked on to Rouletabille, whom she had found the morning after\r\n\r\n      the nightmare tranquilly smoking his pipe in the garden.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, ah, you smoke a pipe. Now you do certainly look exactly like a dear\r\n\r\n      little domovoi-doukh. See how much you are alike. He smokes just like you.\r\n\r\n      Nothing new, eh? You do not look very bright this morning. You are worn\r\n\r\n      out. I have just arranged the little guest-chamber for you, the only one\r\n\r\n      we have, just behind mine. Your bed is waiting for you. Is there anything\r\n\r\n      you need? Tell me. Everything here is at your service.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019m not in need of anything, madame,\u201d said the young man smilingly, after\r\n\r\n      this outpouring of words from the good, heroic dame.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow can you say that, dear child? You will make yourself sick. I want you\r\n\r\n      to understand that I wish you to rest. I want to be a mother to you, if\r\n\r\n      you please, and you must obey me, my child. Have you had breakfast yet\r\n\r\n      this morning? If you do not have breakfast promptly mornings, I will think\r\n\r\n      you are annoyed. I am so annoyed that you have heard the secret of the\r\n\r\n      night. I have been afraid that you would want to leave at once and for\r\n\r\n      good, and that you would have mistaken ideas about the general. There is\r\n\r\n      not a better man in the world than Feodor, and he must have a good, a very\r\n\r\n      good conscience to dare, without fail, to perform such terrible duties as\r\n\r\n      those at Moscow, when he is so good at heart. These things are easy enough\r\n\r\n      for wicked people, but for good men, for good men who can reason it out,\r\n\r\n      who know what they do and that they are condemned to death into the\r\n\r\n      bargain, it is terrible, it is terrible! Why, I told him the moment things\r\n\r\n      began to go wrong in Moscow, \u2018You know what to expect, Feodor. Here is a\r\n\r\n      dreadful time to get through\u2014make out you are sick.\u2019 I believed he\r\n\r\n      was going to strike me, to kill me on the spot. \u2018I! Betray the Emperor in\r\n\r\n      such a moment! His Majesty, to whom I owe everything! What are you\r\n\r\n      thinking of, Matrena Petrovna!\u2019 And he did not speak to me after that for\r\n\r\n      two days. It was only when he saw I was growing very ill that he pardoned\r\n\r\n      me, but he had to be plagued with my jeremiads and the appealing looks of\r\n\r\n      Natacha without end in his own home each time we heard any shooting in the\r\n\r\n      street. Natacha attended the lectures of the Faculty, you know. And she\r\n\r\n      knew many of them, and even some of those who were being killed on the\r\n\r\n      barricades. Ah, life was not easy for him in his own home, the poor\r\n\r\n      general! Besides, there was also Boris, whom I love as well, for that\r\n\r\n      matter, as my own child, because I shall be very happy to see him married\r\n\r\n      to Natacha\u2014there was poor Boris who always came home from the\r\n\r\n      attacks paler than a corpse and who could not keep from moaning with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd Michael?\u201d questioned Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, Michael only came towards the last. He is a new orderly to the\r\n\r\n      general. The government at St. Petersburg sent him, because of course they\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t help learning that Boris rather lacked zeal in repressing the\r\n\r\n      students and did not encourage the general in being as severe as was\r\n\r\n      necessary for the safety of the Empire. But Michael, he has a heart of\r\n\r\n      stone; he knows nothing but the countersign and massacres fathers and\r\n\r\n      mothers, crying, \u2018Vive le Tsar!\u2019 Truly, it seems his heart can only be\r\n\r\n      touched by the sight of Natacha. And that again has caused a good deal of\r\n\r\n      anxiety to Feodor and me. It has caught us in a useless complication that\r\n\r\n      we would have liked to end by the prompt marriage of Natacha and Boris.\r\n\r\n      But Natacha, to our great surprise, has not wished it to be so. No, she\r\n\r\n      has not wished it, saying that there is always time to think of her\r\n\r\n      wedding and that she is in no hurry to leave us. Meantime she entertains\r\n\r\n      herself with this Michael as if she did not fear his passion, and neither\r\n\r\n      has Michael the desperate air of a man who knows the definite engagement\r\n\r\n      of Natacha and Boris. And my step-daughter is not a coquette. No, no. No\r\n\r\n      one can say she is a coquette. At least, no one had been able to say it up\r\n\r\n      to the time that Michael arrived. Can it be that she is a coquette? They\r\n\r\n      are mysterious, these young girls, very mysterious, above all when they\r\n\r\n      have that calm and tranquil look that Natacha always has; a face,\r\n\r\n      monsieur, as you have noticed perhaps, whose beauty is rather passive\r\n\r\n      whatever one says and does, excepting when the volleys in the streets kill\r\n\r\n      her young comrades of the schools. Then I have seen her almost faint,\r\n\r\n      which proves she has a great heart under her tranquil beauty. Poor\r\n\r\n      Natacha! I have seen her excited as I over the life of her father. My\r\n\r\n      little friend, I have seen her searching in the middle of the night, with\r\n\r\n      me, for infernal machines under the furniture, and then she has expressed\r\n\r\n      the opinion that it is nervous, childish, unworthy of us to act like that,\r\n\r\n      like timid beasts under the sofas, and she has left me to search by\r\n\r\n      myself. True, she never quits the general. She is more reassured, and is\r\n\r\n      reassuring to him, at his side. It has an excellent moral effect on him,\r\n\r\n      while I walk about and search like a beast. And she has become as\r\n\r\n      fatalistic as he, and now she sings verses to the guzla, like Boris, or\r\n\r\n      talks in corners with Michael, which makes the two enraged each with the\r\n\r\n      other. They are curious, the young women of St. Petersburg and Moscow,\r\n\r\n      very curious. We were not like that in our time, at Orel. We did not try\r\n\r\n      to enrage people. We would have received a box on the ears if we had.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha came in upon this conversation, happy, in white voile, fresh and\r\n\r\n      smiling like a girl who had passed an excellent night. She asked after the\r\n\r\n      health of the young man very prettily and embraced Matrena, in truth as\r\n\r\n      one embraces a much-beloved mother. She complained again of Matrena\u2019s\r\n\r\n      night-watch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have not stopped it, mamma; you have not stopped it, eh? You are not\r\n\r\n      going to be a little reasonable at last? I beg of you! What has given me\r\n\r\n      such a mother! Why don\u2019t you sleep? Night is made for sleep. Koupriane has\r\n\r\n      upset you. All the terrible things are over in Moscow. There is no\r\n\r\n      occasion to think of them any more. That Koupriane makes himself important\r\n\r\n      with his police-agents and obsesses us all. I am convinced that the affair\r\n\r\n      of the bouquet was the work of his police.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cI have just had them all sent away,\r\n\r\n      all of them\u2014because I think very much the same as you do.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, you will be my friend, Monsieur Rouletabille I promise you,\r\n\r\n      since you have done that. Now that the police are gone we have nothing\r\n\r\n      more to fear. Nothing. I tell you, mamma; you can believe me and not weep\r\n\r\n      any more, mamma dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes; kiss me. Kiss me again!\u201d repeated Matrena, drying her eyes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen you kiss me I forget everything. You love me like your own mother,\r\n\r\n      don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLike my mother. Like my own mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have nothing to hide from me?\u2014tell me, Natacha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing to hide.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen why do you make Boris suffer so? Why don\u2019t you marry him?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I don\u2019t wish to leave you, mamma dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She escaped further parley by jumping up on the garden edge away from\r\n\r\n      Khor, who had just been set free for the day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe dear child,\u201d said Matrena; \u201cthe dear little one, she little knows how\r\n\r\n      much pain she has caused us without being aware of it, by her ideas, her\r\n\r\n      extravagant ideas. Her father said to me one day at Moscow, \u2018Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna, I\u2019ll tell you what I think\u2014Natacha is the victim of the\r\n\r\n      wicked books that have turned the brains of all these poor rebellious\r\n\r\n      students. Yes, yes; it would be better for her and for us if she did not\r\n\r\n      know how to read, for there are moments\u2014my word!\u2014when she\r\n\r\n      talks very wildly, and I have said to myself more than once that with such\r\n\r\n      ideas her place is not in our salon hut behind a barricade. All the same,\u2019 \r\n\r\n      he added after reflection, \u2018I prefer to find her in the salon where I can\r\n\r\n      embrace her than behind a barricade where I would kill her like a mad\r\n\r\n      dog.\u2019 But my husband, dear little monsieur, did not say what he really\r\n\r\n      thinks, for he loves his daughter more than all the rest of the world put\r\n\r\n      together, and there are things that even a general, yes, even a\r\n\r\n      governor-general, would not be able to do without violating both divine\r\n\r\n      and human laws. He suspects Boris also of setting Natacha\u2019s wits awry. We\r\n\r\n      really have to consider that when they are married they will read\r\n\r\n      everything they have a mind to. My husband has much more real respect for\r\n\r\n      Michael Korsakoff because of his impregnable character and his granite\r\n\r\n      conscience. More than once he has said, \u2018Here is the aide I should have\r\n\r\n      had in the worst days of Moscow. He would have spared me much of the\r\n\r\n      individual pain.\u2019 I can understand how that would please the general, but\r\n\r\n      how such a tigerish nature succeeds in appealing to Natacha, how it\r\n\r\n      succeeds in not actually revolting her, these young girls of the capital,\r\n\r\n      one never can tell about them\u2014they get away from all your notions of\r\n\r\n      them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille inquired:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy did Boris say to Michael, \u2018We will return together\u2019? Do they live\r\n\r\n      together?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, in the small villa on the Krestowsky Ostrov, the isle across from\r\n\r\n      ours, that you can see from the window of the sitting-room. Boris chose it\r\n\r\n      because of that. The orderlies wished to have camp-beds prepared for them\r\n\r\n      right here in the general\u2019s house, by a natural devotion to him; but I\r\n\r\n      opposed it, in order to keep them both from Natacha, in whom, of course, I\r\n\r\n      have the most complete confidence, but one cannot be sure about the\r\n\r\n      extravagance of men nowadays.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai came to announce the petit-dejeuner. They found Natacha already at\r\n\r\n      table and she poured them coffee and milk, eating away all the time at a\r\n\r\n      sandwich of anchovies and caviare.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTell me, mamma, do you know what gives me such an appetite? It is the\r\n\r\n      thought of the way poor Koupriane must have taken this dismissal of his\r\n\r\n      men. I should like to go to see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you see him,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cit is unnecessary to tell him that\r\n\r\n      the general will go for a long promenade among the isles this afternoon,\r\n\r\n      because without fail he would send us an escort of gendarmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPapa! A promenade among the islands? Truly? Oh, that is going to be\r\n\r\n      lovely!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you mad, my dear little domovoi, actually mad?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy? Why? It is fine. I must run and tell papa.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour father\u2019s room is locked,\u201d said Matrena brusquely.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes; he is locked in. You have the key. Locked away until death! You\r\n\r\n      will kill him. It will be you who kills him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She left the table without waiting for a reply and went and shut herself\r\n\r\n      also in her chamber.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena looked at Rouletabille, who continued his breakfast as though\r\n\r\n      nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it possible that you speak seriously?\u201d she demanded, coming over and\r\n\r\n      sitting down beside him. \u201cA promenade! Without the police, when we have\r\n\r\n      received again this morning a letter saying now that before forty-eight\r\n\r\n      hours the general will be dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cForty-eight hours,\u201d said Rouletabille, soaking his bread in his\r\n\r\n      chocolate, \u201cforty-eight hours? It is possible. In any case, I know they\r\n\r\n      will try something very soon.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy God, how is it that you believe that? You speak with assurance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, it is necessary to do everything I tell you, to the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut to have the general go out, unless he is guarded\u2014how can you\r\n\r\n      take such a responsibility? When I think about it, when I really think\r\n\r\n      about it, I ask myself how you have dared send away the police. But here,\r\n\r\n      at least, I know what to do in order to feel a little safe, I know that\r\n\r\n      downstairs with Gniagnia and Ermolai we have nothing to fear. No stranger\r\n\r\n      can approach even the basement. The provisions are brought from the lodge\r\n\r\n      by our dvornicks whom we have had sent from my mother\u2019s home in the Orel\r\n\r\n      country and who are as devoted to us as bull-dogs. Not a bottle of\r\n\r\n      preserves is taken into the kitchens without having been previously opened\r\n\r\n      outside. No package comes from any tradesman without being opened in the\r\n\r\n      lodge. Here, within, we are able to feel a little safe, even without the\r\n\r\n      police\u2014but away from here\u2014outside!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, they are going to try to kill your husband within forty-eight\r\n\r\n      hours. Do you desire me to save him perhaps for a long time\u2014for\r\n\r\n      good, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, listen to him! Listen to him, the dear little domovoi! But what will\r\n\r\n      Koupriane say? He will not permit any venturing beyond the villa; none, at\r\n\r\n      least for the moment. Ah, now, how he looks at me, the dear little\r\n\r\n      domovoi! Oh, well, yes. There, I will do as you wish.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well, come into the garden with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She accompanied him, leaning on his arm.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere\u2019s the idea,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cThis afternoon you will go with the\r\n\r\n      general in his rolling-chair. Everybody will follow. Everyone, you\r\n\r\n      understand, Madame\u2014understand me thoroughly, I mean to say that\r\n\r\n      everyone who wishes to come must be invited to. Only those who wish to\r\n\r\n      remain behind will do so. And do not insist. Ah, now, I see, you\r\n\r\n      understand me. Why do you tremble?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut who will guard the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo one. Simply tell the servant at the lodge to watch from the lodge\r\n\r\n      those who enter the villa, but simply from the lodge, without interfering\r\n\r\n      with them, and saying nothing to them, nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will do as you wish. Do you want me to announce our promenade\r\n\r\n      beforehand?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, certainly. Don\u2019t be uneasy; let everybody have the good news.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, I will tell only the general and his friends, you may be sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, dear Madame, just one more word. Do not wait for me at luncheon.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! You are going to leave us?\u201d she cried instantly, breathless. \u201cNo,\r\n\r\n      no. I do not wish it. I am willing to do without the police, but I am not\r\n\r\n      willing to do without you. Everything might happen in your absence.\r\n\r\n      Everything! Everything!\u201d she repeated with singular energy. \u201cBecause, for\r\n\r\n      me, I cannot feel sure as I should, perhaps. Ah, you make me say these\r\n\r\n      things. Such things! But do not go.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo not be afraid; I am not going to leave you, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, you are good! You are kind, kind! Caracho! (Very well.)\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will not leave you. But I must not be at luncheon. If anyone asks where\r\n\r\n      I am, say that I have my business to look after, and have gone to\r\n\r\n      interview political personages in the city.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s only one political personage in Russia,\u201d replied Matrena Petrovna\r\n\r\n      bluntly; \u201cthat is the Tsar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well; say I have gone to interview the Tsar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut no one will believe that. And where will you be?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not know myself. But I will be about the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well, very well, dear little domovoi.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She left him, not knowing what she thought about it all, nor what she\r\n\r\n      should think\u2014her head was all in a muddle.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      In the course of the morning Athanase Georgevitch and Thaddeus\r\n\r\n      Tchnitchnikof arrived. The general was already in the veranda. Michael and\r\n\r\n      Boris arrived shortly after, and inquired in their turn how he had passed\r\n\r\n      the night without the police. When they were told that Feodor was going\r\n\r\n      for a promenade that afternoon they applauded his decision. \u201cBravo! A\r\n\r\n      promenade a la strielka (to the head of the island) at the hour when all\r\n\r\n      St. Petersburg is driving there. That is fine. We will all be there.\u201d The\r\n\r\n      general made them stay for luncheon. Natacha appeared for the meal, in\r\n\r\n      rather melancholy mood. A little before luncheon she had held a double\r\n\r\n      conversation in the garden with Michael and Boris. No one ever could have\r\n\r\n      known what these three young people had said if some stenographic notes in\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s memorandum-book did not give us a notion; the reporter had\r\n\r\n      overheard, by accident surely, since all self-respecting reporters are\r\n\r\n      quite incapable of eavesdropping.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The memorandum notes:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha went into the garden with a book, which she gave to Boris, who\r\n\r\n      pressed her hand lingeringly to his lips. \u201cHere is your book; I return it\r\n\r\n      to you. I don\u2019t want any more of them, the ideas surge so in my brain. It\r\n\r\n      makes my head ache. It is true, you are right, I don\u2019t love novelties. I\r\n\r\n      can satisfy myself with Pouchkine perfectly. The rest are all one to me.\r\n\r\n      Did you pass a good night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Boris (good-looking young man, about thirty years old, blonde, a little\r\n\r\n      effeminate, wistful. A curious appurtenance in the military household of\r\n\r\n      so vigorous a general). \u201cNatacha, there is not an hour that I can call\r\n\r\n      truly good if I spend it away from you, dear, dear Natacha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI ask you seriously if you have passed a good night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She touched his hand a moment and looked into his eyes, but he shook his\r\n\r\n      head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat did you do last night after you reached home?\u201d she demanded\r\n\r\n      insistently. \u201cDid you stay up?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI obeyed you; I only sat a half-hour by the window looking over here at\r\n\r\n      the villa, and then I went to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it is necessary you should get your rest. I wish it for you as for\r\n\r\n      everyone else. This feverish life is impossible. Matrena Petrovna is\r\n\r\n      getting us all ill, and we shall be prostrated.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYesterday,\u201d said Boris, \u201cI looked at the villa for a half-hour from my\r\n\r\n      window. Dear, dear villa, dear night when I can feel you breathing, living\r\n\r\n      near me. As if you had been against my heart. I could have wept because I\r\n\r\n      could hear Michael snoring in his chamber. He seemed happy. At last, I\r\n\r\n      heard nothing more, there was nothing more to hear but the double chorus\r\n\r\n      of frogs in the pools of the island. Our pools, Natacha, are like the\r\n\r\n      enchanted lakes of the Caucasus which are silent by day and sing at\r\n\r\n      evening; there are innumerable throngs of frogs which sing on the same\r\n\r\n      chord, some of them on a major and some on a minor. The chorus speaks from\r\n\r\n      pool to pool, lamenting and moaning across the fields and gardens, and\r\n\r\n      re-echoing like AEolian harps placed opposite one another.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo AEolian harps make so much noise, Boris?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou laugh? I don\u2019t find you yourself half the time. It is Michael who has\r\n\r\n      changed you, and I am out of it. (Here they spoke in Russian.) I shall not\r\n\r\n      be easy until I am your husband. I can\u2019t understand your manner with\r\n\r\n      Michael at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      (Here more Russian words which I do not understand.)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeak French; here is the gardener,\u201d said Natacha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not like the way you are managing our lives. Why do you delay our\r\n\r\n      marriage? Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      (Russian words from Natacha. Gesture of desperation from Boris.)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow long? You say a long time? But that says nothing\u2014a long time.\r\n\r\n      How long? A year? Two years? Ten years? Tell me, or I will kill myself at\r\n\r\n      your feet. No, no; speak or I will kill Michael. On my word! Like a dog!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI swear to you, by the dear head of your mother, Boris, that the date of\r\n\r\n      our marriage does not depend on Michael.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      (Some words in Russian. Boris, a little consoled, holds her hand\r\n\r\n      lingeringly to his lips.)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Conversation between Michael and Natacha in the garden:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell? Have you told him?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI ended at last by making him understand that there is not any hope.\r\n\r\n      None. It is necessary to have patience. I have to have it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is stupid and provoking.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStupid, no. Provoking, yes, if you wish. But you also, you are\r\n\r\n      provoking.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha! Natacha!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      (Here more Russian.) As Natacha started to leave, Michael placed his hand\r\n\r\n      on her shoulder, stopped her and said, looking her direct in the eyes:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere will be a letter from Annouchka this evening, by a messenger at\r\n\r\n      five o\u2019clock.\u201d He made each syllable explicit. \u201cVery important and\r\n\r\n      requiring an immediate reply.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      These notes of Rouletabille\u2019s are not followed by any commentary.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      After luncheon the gentlemen played poker until half-past four, which is\r\n\r\n      the \u201cchic\u201d hour for the promenade to the head of the island. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      had directed Matrena to start exactly at a quarter to five. He appeared in\r\n\r\n      the meantime, announcing that he had just interviewed the mayor of St.\r\n\r\n      Petersburg, which made Athanase laugh, who could not understand that\r\n\r\n      anyone would come clear from Paris to talk with men like that. Natacha\r\n\r\n      came from her chamber to join them for the promenade. Her father told her\r\n\r\n      she looked too worried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They left the villa. Rouletabille noted that the dvornicks were before the\r\n\r\n      gate and that the schwitzar was at his post, from which he could detect\r\n\r\n      everyone who might enter or leave the villa. Matrena pushed the\r\n\r\n      rolling-chair herself. The general was radiant. He had Natacha at his\r\n\r\n      right and at his left Athanase and Thaddeus. The two orderlies followed,\r\n\r\n      talking with Rouletabille, who had monopolized them. The conversation\r\n\r\n      turned on the devotion of Matrena Petrovna, which they placed above the\r\n\r\n      finest heroic traits in the women of antiquity, and also on Natacha\u2019s love\r\n\r\n      for her father. Rouletabille made them talk.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Boris Mourazoff explained that this exceptional love was accounted for by\r\n\r\n      the fact that Natacha\u2019s own mother, the general\u2019s first wife, died in\r\n\r\n      giving birth to their daughter, and accordingly Feodor Feodorovitch had\r\n\r\n      been both father and mother to his daughter. He had raised her with the\r\n\r\n      most touching care, not permitting anyone else, when she was sick, to have\r\n\r\n      the care of passing the nights by her bedside.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha was seven years old when Feodor Feodorovitch was appointed\r\n\r\n      governor of Orel. In the country near Orel, during the summer, the general\r\n\r\n      and his daughter lived on neighborly terms near the family of old Petroff,\r\n\r\n      one of the richest fur merchants in Russia. Old Petroff had a daughter,\r\n\r\n      Matrena, who was magnificent to see, like a beautiful field-flower. She\r\n\r\n      was always in excellent humor, never spoke ill of anyone in the\r\n\r\n      neighborhood, and not only had the fine manners of a city dame but a\r\n\r\n      great, simple heart, which she lavished on the little Natacha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The child returned the affection of the beautiful Matrena, and it was on\r\n\r\n      seeing them always happy to find themselves together that Trebassof\r\n\r\n      dreamed of reestablishing his fireside. The nuptials were quickly\r\n\r\n      arranged, and the child, when she learned that her good Matrena was to wed\r\n\r\n      her papa, danced with joy. Then misfortune came only a few weeks before\r\n\r\n      the ceremony. Old Petroff, who speculated on the Exchange for a long time\r\n\r\n      without anyone knowing anything about it, was ruined from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n      Matrena came one evening to apprise Feodor Feodorovitch of this sad news\r\n\r\n      and return his pledge to him. For all response Feodor placed Natacha in\r\n\r\n      Matrena\u2019s arms. \u201cEmbrace your mother,\u201d he said to the child, and to\r\n\r\n      Matrena, \u201cFrom to-day I consider you my wife, Matrena Petrovna. You should\r\n\r\n      obey me in all things. Take that reply to your father and tell him my\r\n\r\n      purse is at his disposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general was already, at that time, even before he had inherited the\r\n\r\n      Cheremaieff, immensely rich. He had lands behind Nijni as vast as a\r\n\r\n      province, and it would have been difficult to count the number of moujiks\r\n\r\n      who worked for him on his property. Old Pretroff gave his daughter and did\r\n\r\n      not wish to accept anything in exchange. Feodor wished to settle a large\r\n\r\n      allowance on his wife; her father opposed that, and Matrena sided with him\r\n\r\n      in the matter against her husband, because of Natacha. \u201cIt all belongs to\r\n\r\n      the little one,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI accept the position of her mother, but\r\n\r\n      on the condition that she shall never lose a kopeck of her inheritance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo that,\u201d concluded Boris, \u201cif the general died tomorrow she would be\r\n\r\n      poorer than Job.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen the general is Matrena\u2019s sole resource,\u201d reflected Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      aloud.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can understand her hanging onto him,\u201d said Michael Korsakoff, blowing\r\n\r\n      the smoke of his yellow cigarette. \u201cLook at her. She watches him like a\r\n\r\n      treasure.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean, Michael Nikolaievitch?\u201d said Boris, curtly. \u201cYou\r\n\r\n      believe, do you, that the devotion of Matrena Petrovna is not\r\n\r\n      disinterested. You must know her very poorly to dare utter such a\r\n\r\n      thought.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have never had that thought, Boris Alexandrovitch,\u201d replied the other\r\n\r\n      in a tone curter still. \u201cTo be able to imagine that anyone who lives in\r\n\r\n      the Trebassofs\u2019 home could have such a thought needs an ass\u2019s head,\r\n\r\n      surely.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe will speak of it again, Michael Nikolaievitch.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt your pleasure, Boris Alexandrovitch.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They had exchanged these latter words tranquilly continuing their walk and\r\n\r\n      negligently smoking their yellow tobacco. Rouletabille was between them.\r\n\r\n      He did not regard them; he paid no attention even to their quarrel; he had\r\n\r\n      eyes only for Natacha, who just now quit her place beside her father\u2019s\r\n\r\n      wheel-chair and passed by them with a little nod of the head, seeming in\r\n\r\n      haste to retrace the way back to the villa.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you leaving us?\u201d Boris demanded of her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, I will rejoin you immediately. I have forgotten my umbrella.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I will go and get it for you,\u201d proposed Michael.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no. I have to go to the villa; I will return right away.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She was already past them. Rouletabille, during this, looked at Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna, who looked at him also, turning toward the young man a visage\r\n\r\n      pale as wax. But no one else noted the emotion of the good Matrena, who\r\n\r\n      resumed pushing the general\u2019s wheel-chair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille asked the officers, \u201cWas this arrangement because the first\r\n\r\n      wife of the general, Natacha\u2019s mother, was rich?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo. The general, who always had his heart in his hand,\u201d said Boris,\r\n\r\n      \u201cmarried her for her great beauty. She was a beautiful girl of the\r\n\r\n      Caucasus, of excellent family besides, that Feodor Feodorovitch had known\r\n\r\n      when he was in garrison at Tiflis.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn short,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cthe day that General Trebassof dies Madame\r\n\r\n      Trebassof, who now possesses everything, will have nothing, and the\r\n\r\n      daughter, who now has nothing, will have everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly that,\u201d said Michael.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat doesn\u2019t keep Matrena Petrovna and Natacha Feodorovna from deeply\r\n\r\n      loving each other,\u201d observed Boris.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The little party drew near the \u201cPoint.\u201d So far the promenade had been\r\n\r\n      along pleasant open country, among the low meadows traversed by fresh\r\n\r\n      streams, across which tiny bridges had been built, among bright gardens\r\n\r\n      guarded by porcelain dwarfs, or in the shade of small weeds from the feet\r\n\r\n      of whose trees the newly-cut grass gave a seasonal fragrance. All was\r\n\r\n      reflected in the pools\u2014which lay like glass whereon a scene-painter\r\n\r\n      had cut the green hearts of the pond-lily leaves. An adorable country\r\n\r\n      glimpse which seemed to have been created centuries back for the amusement\r\n\r\n      of a queen and preserved, immaculately trimmed and cleaned, from\r\n\r\n      generation to generation, for the eternal charm of such an hour as this on\r\n\r\n      the banks of the Gulf of Finland.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Now they had reached the bank of the Gulf, and the waves rippled to the\r\n\r\n      prows of the light ships, which dipped gracefully like huge and rapid\r\n\r\n      sea-gulls, under the pressure of their great white sails.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Along the roadway, broader now, glided, silently and at walking pace, the\r\n\r\n      double file of luxurious equipages with impatient horses, the open\r\n\r\n      carriages in which the great personages of the court saw the view and let\r\n\r\n      themselves be seen. Enormous coachmen held the reins high. Lively young\r\n\r\n      women, negligently reclining against the cushions, displayed their new\r\n\r\n      Paris toilettes, and kept young officers on horseback busy with salutes.\r\n\r\n      There were all kinds of uniforms. No talking was heard. Everyone was kept\r\n\r\n      busy looking. There rang in the pure, thin air only the noise of the\r\n\r\n      champing bits and the tintinnabulation of the bells attached to the hairy\r\n\r\n      Finnish ponies\u2019 collars. And all that, so beautiful, fresh, charming and\r\n\r\n      clear, and silent, it all seemed more a dream than even that which hung in\r\n\r\n      the pools, suspended between the crystal of the air and the crystal of the\r\n\r\n      water. The transparence of the sky and the transparence of the gulf\r\n\r\n      blended their two unrealities so that one could not note where the\r\n\r\n      horizons met.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at the view and looked at the general, and in all his\r\n\r\n      young vibrating soul there was a sense of infinite sadness, for he\r\n\r\n      recalled those terrible words in the night: \u201cThey have gone into all the\r\n\r\n      corners of the Russian land, and they have not found a single corner of\r\n\r\n      that land where there are not moanings.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d thought he, \u201cthey have\r\n\r\n      not come into this corner, apparently. I don\u2019t know anything lovelier or\r\n\r\n      happier in the world.\u201d No, no, Rouletabille, they have not come here. In\r\n\r\n      every country there is a corner of happy life, which the poor are ashamed\r\n\r\n      to approach, which they know nothing of, and of which merely the sight\r\n\r\n      would turn famished mothers enraged, with their thin bosoms, and, if it is\r\n\r\n      not more beautiful than that, certainly no part of the earth is made so\r\n\r\n      atrocious to live in for some, nor so happy for others as in this Scythian\r\n\r\n      country, the boreal country of the world.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile the little group about the general\u2019s rolling-chair had attracted\r\n\r\n      attention. Some passers-by saluted, and the news spread quickly that\r\n\r\n      General Trebassof had come for a promenade to \u201cthe Point.\u201d Heads turned as\r\n\r\n      carriages passed; the general, noticing how much excitement his presence\r\n\r\n      produced, begged Matrena Petrovna to push his chair into an adjacent\r\n\r\n      by-path, behind a shield of trees where he would be able to enjoy the\r\n\r\n      spectacle in peace.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He was found, nevertheless, by Koupriane, the Chief of Police, who was\r\n\r\n      looking for him. He had gone to the datcha and been told there that the\r\n\r\n      general, accompanied by his friends and the young Frenchman, had gone for\r\n\r\n      a turn along the gulf. Koupriane had left his carriage at the datcha, and\r\n\r\n      taken the shortest route after them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He was a fine man, large, solid, clear-eyed. His uniform showed his fine\r\n\r\n      build to advantage. He was generally liked in St. Petersburg, where his\r\n\r\n      martial bearing and his well-known bravery had given him a sort of\r\n\r\n      popularity in society, which, on the other hand, had great disdain for\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski, the head of the Secret Police, who was known to be capable of\r\n\r\n      anything underhanded and had been accused of sometimes playing into the\r\n\r\n      hands of the Nihilists, whom he disguised as agents-provocateurs, without\r\n\r\n      anybody really doubting it, and he had to fight against these widespread\r\n\r\n      political suspicions.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Well-informed men declared that the death of the previous \u201cprime\r\n\r\n      minister,\u201d who had been blown up before Varsovie station when he was on\r\n\r\n      his way to the Tsar at Peterhof, was Gounsovski\u2019s work and that in this he\r\n\r\n      was the instrument of the party at court which had sworn the death of the\r\n\r\n      minister which inconvenienced it.* On the other hand, everyone regarded\r\n\r\n      Koupriane as incapable of participating in any such horrors and that he\r\n\r\n      contented himself with honest performance of his obvious duties, confining\r\n\r\n      himself to ridding the streets of its troublesome elements, and sending to\r\n\r\n      Siberia as many as he could of the hot-heads, without lowering himself to\r\n\r\n      the compromises which, more than once, had given grounds for the enemies\r\n\r\n      of the empire to maintain that it was difficult to say whether the chiefs\r\n\r\n      of the Russian police played the part of the law or that of the\r\n\r\n      revolutionary party, even that the police had been at the end of a certain\r\n\r\n      time of such mixed procedure hardly able to decide themselves which they\r\n\r\n      did.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This afternoon Koupriane appeared very nervous. He paid his compliments to\r\n\r\n      the general, grumbled at his imprudence, praised him for his bravery, and\r\n\r\n      then at once picked out Rouletabille, whom he took aside to talk to.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have sent my men back to me,\u201d said he to the young reporter. \u201cYou\r\n\r\n      understand that I do not allow that. They are furious, and quite rightly.\r\n\r\n      You have given publicly as explanation of their departure\u2014a\r\n\r\n      departure which has naturally astonished, stupefied the general\u2019s friends\u2014the\r\n\r\n      suspicion of their possible participation in the last attack. That is\r\n\r\n      abominable, and I will not permit it. My men have not been trained in the\r\n\r\n      methods of Gounsovski, and it does them a cruel injury, which I resent,\r\n\r\n      for that matter, personally, to treat them this way. But let that go, as a\r\n\r\n      matter of sentiment, and return to the simple fact itself, which proves\r\n\r\n      your excessive imprudence, not to say more, and which involves you, you\r\n\r\n      alone, in a responsibility of which you certainly have not measured the\r\n\r\n      importance. All in all, I consider that you have strangely abused the\r\n\r\n      complete authority that I gave you upon the Emperor\u2019s orders. When I\r\n\r\n      learned what you had done I went to find the Tsar, as was my duty, and\r\n\r\n      told him the whole thing. He was more astonished than can be expressed. He\r\n\r\n      directed me to go myself to find out just how things were and to furnish\r\n\r\n      the general the guard you had removed. I arrive at the isles and not only\r\n\r\n      find the villa open like a mill where anyone may enter, but I am informed,\r\n\r\n      and then I see, that the general is promenading in the midst of the crowd,\r\n\r\n      at the mercy of the first miserable venturer. Monsieur Rouletabille, I am\r\n\r\n      not satisfied. The Tsar is not satisfied. And, within an hour, my men will\r\n\r\n      return to assume their guard at the datcha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille listened to the end. No one ever had spoken to him in that\r\n\r\n      tone. He was red, and as ready to burst as a child\u2019s balloon blown too\r\n\r\n      hard. He said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd I will take the train this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will go?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, and you can guard your general all alone. I have had enough of it.\r\n\r\n      Ah, you are not satisfied! Ah, the Tsar is not satisfied! It is too bad.\r\n\r\n      No more of it for me. Monsieur, I am not satisfied, and I say Good-evening\r\n\r\n      to you. Only do not forget to send me from here every three or four days a\r\n\r\n      letter which will keep me informed of the health of the general, whom I\r\n\r\n      love dearly. I will offer up a little prayer for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thereupon he was silent, for he caught the glance of Matrena Petrovna, a\r\n\r\n      glance so desolated, so imploring, so desperate, that the poor woman\r\n\r\n      inspired him anew with great pity. Natacha had not returned. What was the\r\n\r\n      young girl doing at that moment? If Matrena really loved Natacha she must\r\n\r\n      be suffering atrociously. Koupriane spoke; Rouletabille did not hear him,\r\n\r\n      and he had already forgotten his own anger. His spirit was wrapped in the\r\n\r\n      mystery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d Koupriane finished by saying, tugging his sleeve, \u201cdo you hear\r\n\r\n      me? I pray you at least reply to me. I offer all possible excuses for\r\n\r\n      speaking to you in that tone. I reiterate them. I ask your pardon. I pray\r\n\r\n      you to explain your conduct, which appeared imprudent to me but which,\r\n\r\n      after all, should have some reason. I have to explain to the Emperor. Will\r\n\r\n      you tell me? What ought I to say to the Emperor?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing at all,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cI have no explanation to give you or\r\n\r\n      the Emperor, or to anyone. You can offer him my utmost homage and do me\r\n\r\n      the kindness to vise my passport for this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he sighed:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is too bad, for we were just about to see something interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane looked at him. Rouletabille had not quitted Matrena Petrovna\u2019s\r\n\r\n      eyes, and her pallor struck Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJust a minute,\u201d continued the young man. \u201cI\u2019m sure there is someone who\r\n\r\n      will miss me\u2014that brave woman there. Ask her which she prefers, all\r\n\r\n      your police, or her dear little domovoi. We are good friends already. And\u2014don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      forget to present my condolences to her when the terrible moment has\r\n\r\n      come.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was Koupriane\u2019s turn to be troubled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He coughed and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou believe, then, that the general runs a great immediate danger?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not only believe it, monsieur, I am sure of it. His death is a\r\n\r\n      matter of hours for the poor dear man. Before I go I shall not fail to\r\n\r\n      tell him, so that he can prepare himself comfortably for the great journey\r\n\r\n      and ask pardon of the Lord for the rather heavy hand he has laid on these\r\n\r\n      poor men of Presnia.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Rouletabille, have you discovered something?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood Lord, yes, I have discovered something, Monsieur Koupriane. You\r\n\r\n      don\u2019t suppose I have come so far to waste my time, do you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSomething no one else knows?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur Koupriane, otherwise I shouldn\u2019t have troubled to feel\r\n\r\n      concerned. Something I have not confided to anyone, not even to my\r\n\r\n      note-book, because a note-book, you know, a note-book can always be lost.\r\n\r\n      I just mention that in case you had any idea of having me searched before\r\n\r\n      my departure.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, Monsieur Rouletabille!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh, eh, like the way the police do in your country; in mine too, for that\r\n\r\n      matter. Yes, that\u2019s often enough seen. The police, furious because they\r\n\r\n      can\u2019t hit a clue in some case that interests them, arrest a reporter who\r\n\r\n      knows more than they do, in order to make him talk. But\u2014nothing of\r\n\r\n      that sort with me, monsieur. You might have me taken to your famous\r\n\r\n      \u2018Terrible Section,\u2019 I\u2019d not open my mouth, not even in the famous\r\n\r\n      rocking-chair, not even under the blows of clenched fists.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Rouletabille, what do you take us for? You are the guest of the\r\n\r\n      Tsar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, I have the word of an honest man. Very well, I will treat you as an\r\n\r\n      honest man. I will tell you what I have discovered. I don\u2019t wish through\r\n\r\n      any false pride to keep you in darkness about something which may perhaps\u2014I\r\n\r\n      say perhaps\u2014permit you to save the general.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTell me. I am listening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it is perfectly understood that once I have told you this you will\r\n\r\n      give me my passport and allow me to depart?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou feel that you couldn\u2019t possibly,\u201d inquired Koupriane, more and more\r\n\r\n      troubled, and after a moment of hesitation, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t possibly tell me\r\n\r\n      that and yet remain?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur. From the moment you place me under the necessity of\r\n\r\n      explaining each of my movements and each of my acts, I prefer to go and\r\n\r\n      leave to you that \u2018responsibility\u2019 of which you spoke just now, my dear\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Koupriane.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Astonished and disquieted by this long conversation between Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      and the Head of Police, Matrena Petrovna continually turned upon them her\r\n\r\n      anguished glance, which always insensibly softened as it rested on\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille. Koupriane read there all the hope that the brave woman had\r\n\r\n      in the young reporter, and he read also in Rouletabille\u2019s eye all the\r\n\r\n      extraordinary confidence that the mere boy had in himself. As a last\r\n\r\n      consideration had he not already something in hand in circumstances where\r\n\r\n      all the police of the world had admitted themselves vanquished? Koupriane\r\n\r\n      pressed Rouletabille\u2019s hand and said just one word to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRemain.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having saluted the general and Matrena affectionately, and a group of\r\n\r\n      friends in one courteous sweep, he departed, with thoughtful brow.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      During all this time the general, enchanted with the promenade, told\r\n\r\n      stories of the Caucasus to his friends, believing himself young again and\r\n\r\n      re-living his nights as sub-lieutenant at Tills. As to Natacha, no one had\r\n\r\n      seen her. They retraced the way to the villa along deserted by-paths.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane\u2019s call made occasion for Athanase Georgevitch and Thaddeus, and\r\n\r\n      the two officers also, to say that he was the only honest man in all the\r\n\r\n      Russian police, and that Matrena Petrovna was a great woman to have dared\r\n\r\n      rid herself of the entire clique of agents, who are often more\r\n\r\n      revolutionary than the Nihilists themselves. Thus they arrived at the\r\n\r\n      datcha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general inquired for Natacha, not understanding why she had left him\r\n\r\n      thus during his first venture out. The schwitzar replied that the young\r\n\r\n      mistress had returned to the house and had left again about a quarter of\r\n\r\n      an hour later, taking the way that the party had gone on their promenade,\r\n\r\n      and he had not seen her since.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Boris spoke up:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe must have passed on the other side of the carriages while we were\r\n\r\n      behind the trees, general, and not seeing us she has gone on her way,\r\n\r\n      making the round of the island, over as far as the Barque.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The explanation seemed the most plausible one.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHas anyone else been here?\u201d demanded Matrena, forcing her voice to be\r\n\r\n      calm. Rouletabille saw her hand tremble on the handle of the\r\n\r\n      rolling-chair, which she had not quitted for a second during all the\r\n\r\n      promenade, refusing aid from the officers, the friends, and even from\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFirst there came the Head of Police, who told me he would go and find\r\n\r\n      you, Barinia, and right after, His Excellency the Marshal of the Court.\r\n\r\n      His Excellency will return, although he is very pressed for time, before\r\n\r\n      he takes the train at seven o\u2019clock for Krasnoie-Coelo.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      All this had been said in Russian, naturally, but Matrena translated the\r\n\r\n      words of the schwitzar into French in a low voice for Rouletabille, who\r\n\r\n      was near her. The general during this time had taken Rouletabille\u2019s hand\r\n\r\n      and pressed it affectionately, as if, in that mute way, to thank him for\r\n\r\n      all the young man had done for them. Feodor himself also had confidence,\r\n\r\n      and he was grateful for the freer air that he was being allowed to\r\n\r\n      breathe. It seemed to him that he was emerging from prison. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\n      as the promenade had been a little fatiguing, Matrena ordered him to go\r\n\r\n      and rest immediately. Athanase and Thaddeus took their leave. The two\r\n\r\n      officers were already at the end of the garden, talking coldly, and almost\r\n\r\n      confronting one another, like wooden soldiers. Without doubt they were\r\n\r\n      arranging the conditions of an encounter to settle their little difference\r\n\r\n      at once.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The schwitzar gathered the general into his great arms and carried him\r\n\r\n      into the veranda. Feodor demanded five minutes\u2019 respite before he was\r\n\r\n      taken upstairs to his chamber. Matrena Petrovna had a light luncheon\r\n\r\n      brought at his request. In truth, the good woman trembled with impatience\r\n\r\n      and hardly dared move without consulting Rouletabille\u2019s face. While the\r\n\r\n      general talked with Ermolai, who passed him his tea, Rouletabille made a\r\n\r\n      sign to Matrena that she understood at once. She joined the young man in\r\n\r\n      the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame,\u201d he said rapidly, in a low voice, \u201cyou must go at once to see\r\n\r\n      what has happened there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He pointed to the dining-room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was pitiful to watch her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo, madame, with courage.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause, madame, I have something to do elsewhere. Give me the keys of\r\n\r\n      the next floor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no. What for?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot a second\u2019s delay, for the love of Heaven. Do what I tell you on your\r\n\r\n      side, and let me do mine. The keys! Come, the keys!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He snatched them rather than took them, and pointed a last time to the\r\n\r\n      dining-room with a gesture so commanding that she did not hesitate\r\n\r\n      further. She entered the dining-room, shaking, while he bounded to the\r\n\r\n      upper floor. He was not long. He took only time to open the doors, throw a\r\n\r\n      glance into the general\u2019s chamber, a single glance, and to return, letting\r\n\r\n      a cry of joy escape him, borrowed from his new and very limited\r\n\r\n      accomplishment of Russian, \u201cCaracho!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      How Rouletabille, who had not spent half a second examining the general\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber, was able to be certain that all went well on that side, when it\r\n\r\n      took Matrena\u2014and that how many times a day!\u2014at least a quarter\r\n\r\n      of an hour of ferreting in all the corners each time she explored her\r\n\r\n      house before she was even inadequately reassured, was a question. If that\r\n\r\n      dear heroic woman had been with him during this \u201cinstant information\u201d she\r\n\r\n      would have received such a shock that, with all confidence gone, she would\r\n\r\n      have sent for Koupriane immediately, and all his agents, reinforced by the\r\n\r\n      personnel of the Okrana (Secret Police). Rouletabille at once rejoined the\r\n\r\n      general, whistling. Feodor and Ermolai were deep in conversation about the\r\n\r\n      Orel country. The young man did not disturb them. Then, soon, Matrena\r\n\r\n      reappeared. He saw her come in quite radiant. He handed back her keys, and\r\n\r\n      she took them mechanically. She was overjoyed and did not try to hide it.\r\n\r\n      The general himself noticed it, and asked what had made her so.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is my happiness over our first promenade since we arrived at the\r\n\r\n      datcha des Iles,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd now you must go upstairs to bed,\r\n\r\n      Feodor. You will pass a good night, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can sleep only if you sleep, Matrena.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI promise you. It is quite possible now that we have our dear little\r\n\r\n      domovoi. You know, Feodor, that he smokes his pipe just like the dear\r\n\r\n      little porcelain domovoi.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe does resemble him, he certainly does,\u201d said Feodor. \u201cThat makes us\r\n\r\n      feel happy, but I wish him to sleep also.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u201d smiled Rouletabille, \u201ceverybody will sleep here. That is the\r\n\r\n      countersign. We have watched enough. Since the police are gone we can all\r\n\r\n      sleep, believe me, general.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh, eh, I believe you, on my word, easily enough. There were only they in\r\n\r\n      the house capable of attempting that affair of the bouquet. I have thought\r\n\r\n      that all out, and now I am at ease. And anyway, whatever happens, it is\r\n\r\n      necessary to get sleep, isn\u2019t it? The chances of war! Nichevo!\u201d He pressed\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s hand, and Matrena Petrovna took, as was her habit, Feodor\r\n\r\n      Feodorovitch on her back and lugged him to his chamber. In that also she\r\n\r\n      refused aid from anyone. The general clung to his wife\u2019s neck during the\r\n\r\n      ascent and laughed like a child. Rouletabille remained in the hallway,\r\n\r\n      watching the garden attentively. Ermolai walked out of the villa and\r\n\r\n      crossed the garden, going to meet a personage in uniform whom the young\r\n\r\n      man recognized immediately as the grand-marshal of the court, who had\r\n\r\n      introduced him to the Tsar. Ermolai informed him that Madame Matrena was\r\n\r\n      engaged in helping her husband retire, and the marshal remained at the end\r\n\r\n      of the garden where he had found Michael and Boris talking in the kiosque.\r\n\r\n      All three remained there for some time in conversation, standing by a\r\n\r\n      table where General and Madame Trebassof sometimes dined when they had no\r\n\r\n      guests. As they talked the marshal played with a box of white cardboard\r\n\r\n      tied with a pink string. At this moment Matrena, who had not been able to\r\n\r\n      resist the desire to talk for a moment with Rouletabille and tell him how\r\n\r\n      happy she was, rejoined the young man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLittle domovoi,\u201d said she, laying her hand on his shoulder, \u201cyou have not\r\n\r\n      watched on this side?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She pointed in her turn to the dining-room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no. You have seen it, madame, and I am sufficiently informed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerfectly. There is nothing. No one has worked there! No one has touched\r\n\r\n      the board. I knew it. I am sure of it. It is dreadful what we have thought\r\n\r\n      about it! Oh, you do not know how relieved and happy I am. Ah, Natacha,\r\n\r\n      Natacha, I have not loved you in vain. (She pronounced these words in\r\n\r\n      accents of great beauty and tragic sincerity.) When I saw her leave us, my\r\n\r\n      dear, ah, my legs sank under me. When she said, \u2018I have forgotten\r\n\r\n      something; I must hurry back,\u2019 I felt I had not the strength to go a\r\n\r\n      single step. But now I certainly am happy, that weight at least is off my\r\n\r\n      heart, off my heart, dear little domovoi, because of you, because of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She embraced him, and then ran away, like one possessed, to resume her\r\n\r\n      post near the general.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Notes in Rouletabille\u2019s memorandum-book: The affair of the little cavity\r\n\r\n      under the floor not having been touched again proves nothing for or\r\n\r\n      against Natacha (even though that excellent Matrena Petrovna thinks so).\r\n\r\n      Natacha could very well have been warned by the too great care with which\r\n\r\n      Madame Matrena watched the floor. My opinion, since I saw Matrena lift the\r\n\r\n      carpet the first time without any real precaution, is that they have\r\n\r\n      definitely abandoned the preparation of that attack and are trying to\r\n\r\n      account for the secret becoming known. What Matrena feels so sure of is\r\n\r\n      that the trap I laid by the promenade to the Point was against Natacha\r\n\r\n      particularly. I knew beforehand that Natacha would absent herself during\r\n\r\n      the promenade. I\u2019m not looking for anything new from Natacha, but what I\r\n\r\n      did need was to be sure that Matrena didn\u2019t detest Natacha, and that she\r\n\r\n      had not faked the preparations for an attack under the floor in such a way\r\n\r\n      as to throw almost certain suspicion on her step-daughter. I am sure about\r\n\r\n      that now. Matrena is innocent of such a thing, the poor dear soul. If\r\n\r\n      Matrena had been a monster the occasion was too good. Natacha\u2019s absence,\r\n\r\n      her solitary presence for a quarter of an hour in the empty villa, all\r\n\r\n      would have urged Matrena, whom I sent alone to search under the carpet in\r\n\r\n      the dining-room, to draw the last nails from the board if she was really\r\n\r\n      guilty of having drawn the others. Natacha would have been lost then!\r\n\r\n      Matrena returned sincerely, tragically happy at not having found anything\r\n\r\n      new, and now I have the material proof that I needed. Morally and\r\n\r\n      physically Matrena is removed from it. So I am going to speak to her about\r\n\r\n      the hat-pin. I believe that the matter is urgent on that side rather than\r\n\r\n      on the side of the nails in the floor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      VI. THE MYSTERIOUS HAND\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      After the departure of Matrena, Rouletabille turned his attention to the\r\n\r\n      garden. Neither the marshal of the court nor the officers were there any\r\n\r\n      longer. The three men had disappeared. Rouletabille wished to know at once\r\n\r\n      where they had gone. He went rapidly to the gate, named the officers and\r\n\r\n      the marshal to Ermolai, and Ermolai made a sign that they had passed out.\r\n\r\n      Even as he spoke he saw the marshal\u2019s carriage disappear around a corner\r\n\r\n      of the road. As to the two officers, they were nowhere on the roadway. He\r\n\r\n      was surprised that the marshal should have gone without seeing Matrena or\r\n\r\n      the general or himself, and, above all, he was disquieted by the\r\n\r\n      disappearance of the orderlies. He gathered from the gestures of Ermolai\r\n\r\n      that they had passed before the lodge only a few minutes after the\r\n\r\n      marshal\u2019s departure. They had gone together. Rouletabille set himself to\r\n\r\n      follow them, traced their steps in the soft earth of the roadway and soon\r\n\r\n      they crossed onto the grass. At this point the tracks through the massed\r\n\r\n      ferns became very difficult to follow. He hurried along, bending close to\r\n\r\n      the ground over such traces as he could see, which continually led him\r\n\r\n      astray, but which conducted him finally to the thing that he sought. A\r\n\r\n      noise of voices made him raise his head and then throw himself behind a\r\n\r\n      tree. Not twenty steps from him Natacha and Boris were having an animated\r\n\r\n      conversation. The young officer held himself erect directly in front of\r\n\r\n      her, frowning and impatient. Under the uniform cloak that he had wrapped\r\n\r\n      about him without having bothered to use the sleeves, which were tossed up\r\n\r\n      over his chest, Boris had his arms crossed. His entire attitude indicated\r\n\r\n      hauteur, coldness and disdain for what he was hearing. Natacha never\r\n\r\n      appeared calmer or more mistress of herself. She talked to him rapidly and\r\n\r\n      mostly in a low voice. Sometimes a word in Russian sounded, and then she\r\n\r\n      resumed her care to speak low. Finally she ceased, and Boris, after a\r\n\r\n      short silence, in which he had seemed to reflect deeply, pronounced\r\n\r\n      distinctly these words in French, pronouncing them syllable by syllable,\r\n\r\n      as though to give them additional force:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou ask a frightful thing of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is necessary to grant it to me,\u201d said the young girl with singular\r\n\r\n      energy. \u201cYou understand, Boris Alexandrovitch! It is necessary.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Her gaze, after she had glanced penetratingly all around her and\r\n\r\n      discovered nothing suspicious, rested tenderly on the young officer, while\r\n\r\n      she murmured, \u201cMy Boris!\u201d The young man could not resist either the\r\n\r\n      sweetness of that voice, nor the captivating charm of that glance. He took\r\n\r\n      the hand she extended toward him and kissed it passionately. His eyes,\r\n\r\n      fixed on Natacha, proclaimed that he granted everything that she wished\r\n\r\n      and admitted himself vanquished. Then she said, always with that adorable\r\n\r\n      gaze upon him, \u201cThis evening!\u201d He replied, \u201cYes, yes. This evening! This\r\n\r\n      evening!\u201d upon which Natacha withdrew her hand and made a sign to the\r\n\r\n      officer to leave, which he promptly obeyed. Natacha remained there still a\r\n\r\n      long time, plunged in thought. Rouletabille had already taken the road\r\n\r\n      back to the villa. Matrena Petrovna was watching for his return, seated on\r\n\r\n      the first step of the landing on the great staircase which ran up from the\r\n\r\n      veranda. When she saw him she ran to him. He had already reached the\r\n\r\n      dining-room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnyone in the house?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo one. Natacha has not returned, and...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour step-daughter is coming in now. Ask her where she has been, if she\r\n\r\n      has seen the orderlies, and if they said they would return this evening,\r\n\r\n      in case she answers that she has seen them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well, little domovoi doukh. The orderlies left without my seeing\r\n\r\n      when they went.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u201d interrupted Rouletabille, \u201cbefore she arrives, give me all her\r\n\r\n      hat-pins.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI say, all her hat-pins. Quickly!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena ran to Natacha\u2019s chamber and returned with three enormous hat-pins\r\n\r\n      with beautifully-cut stones in them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThese are all?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are all I have found. I know she has two others. She has one on her\r\n\r\n      head, or two, perhaps; I can\u2019t find them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTake these back where you found them,\u201d said the reporter, after glancing\r\n\r\n      at them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena returned immediately, not understanding what he was doing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd now, your hat-pins. Yes, your hat-pins.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, I have only two, and here they are,\u201d said she, drawing them from the\r\n\r\n      toque she had been wearing and had thrown on the sofa when she re-entered\r\n\r\n      the house.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille gave hers the same inspection.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThanks. Here is your step-daughter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha entered, flushed and smiling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, well,\u201d said she, quite breathless, \u201cyou may boast that I had to\r\n\r\n      search for you. I made the entire round, clear past the Barque. Has the\r\n\r\n      promenade done papa good?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, he is asleep,\u201d replied Matrena. \u201cHave you met Boris and Michael?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She appeared to hesitate a second, then replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, for an instant.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid they say whether they would return this evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, slightly troubled. \u201cWhy all these questions?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She flushed still more.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I thought it strange,\u201d parried Matrena, \u201cthat they went away as\r\n\r\n      they did, without saying goodby, without a word, without inquiring if the\r\n\r\n      general needed them. There is something stranger yet. Did you see Kaltsof\r\n\r\n      with them, the grand-marshal of the court?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cKaltsof came for a moment, entered the garden and went away again without\r\n\r\n      seeing us, without saying even a word to the general.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u201d said Natacha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With apparent indifference, she raised her arms and drew out her hat-pins.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille watched the pin without a word. The young girl hardly seemed\r\n\r\n      aware of their presence. Entirely absorbed in strange thoughts, she\r\n\r\n      replaced the pin in her hat and went to hang it in the veranda, which\r\n\r\n      served also as vestibule. Rouletabille never quitted her eyes. Matrena\r\n\r\n      watched the reporter with a stupid glance. Natacha crossed the\r\n\r\n      drawing-room and entered her chamber by passing through her little\r\n\r\n      sitting-room, through which all entrance to her chamber had to be made.\r\n\r\n      That little room, though, had three doors. One opened into Natacha\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber, one into the drawing-room, and the third into the little passage\r\n\r\n      in a corner of the house where was the stairway by which the servants\r\n\r\n      passed from the kitchens to the ground-floor and the upper floor. This\r\n\r\n      passage had also a door giving directly upon the drawing-room. It was\r\n\r\n      certainly a poor arrangement for serving the dining-room, which was on the\r\n\r\n      other side of the drawing-room and behind the veranda, such a chance\r\n\r\n      laying-out of a house as one often sees in the off-hand planning of many\r\n\r\n      places in the country.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Alone again with Rouletabille, Matrena noticed that he had not lost sight\r\n\r\n      of the corner of the veranda where Natacha had hung her hat. Beside this\r\n\r\n      hat there was a toque that Ermolai had brought in. The old servant had\r\n\r\n      found it in some corner of the garden or the conservatory where he had\r\n\r\n      been. A hat-pin stuck out of that toque also.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhose toque is that?\u201d asked Rouletabille. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it on the head\r\n\r\n      of anyone here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is Natacha\u2019s,\u201d replied Matrena.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She moved toward it, but the young man held her back, went into the\r\n\r\n      veranda himself, and, without touching it, standing on tiptoe, he examined\r\n\r\n      the pin. He sank back on his heels and turned toward Matrena. She caught a\r\n\r\n      glimpse of fleeting emotion on the face of her little friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExplain to me,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But he gave her a glance that frightened her, and said low:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo and give orders right away that dinner be served in the veranda. All\r\n\r\n      through dinner it is absolutely necessary that the door of Natacha\u2019s\r\n\r\n      sitting-room, and that of the stairway passage, and that of the veranda\r\n\r\n      giving on the drawing-room remain open all the time. Do you understand me?\r\n\r\n      As soon as you have given your orders go to the general\u2019s chamber and do\r\n\r\n      not quit the general\u2019s bedside, keep it in view. Come down to dinner when\r\n\r\n      it is announced, and do not bother yourself about anything further.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      So saying, he filled his pipe, lighted it with a sort of sigh of relief,\r\n\r\n      and, after a final order to Matrena, \u201cGo,\u201d he went into the garden,\r\n\r\n      puffing great clouds. Anyone would have said he hadn\u2019t smoked in a week.\r\n\r\n      He appeared not to be thinking but just idly enjoying himself. In fact, he\r\n\r\n      played like a child with Milinki, Matrena\u2019s pet cat, which he pursued\r\n\r\n      behind the shrubs, up into the little kiosque which, raised on piles,\r\n\r\n      lifted its steep thatched roof above the panorama of the isles that\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille settled down to contemplate like an artist with ample\r\n\r\n      leisure.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The dinner, where Matrena, Natacha and Rouletabille were together again,\r\n\r\n      was lively. The young man having declared that he was more and more\r\n\r\n      convinced that the mystery of the bomb in the bouquet was simply a play of\r\n\r\n      the police, Natacha reinforced his opinion, and following that they found\r\n\r\n      themselves in agreement on about everything else. For himself, the\r\n\r\n      reporter during that conversation hid a real horror which had seized him\r\n\r\n      at the cynical and inappropriate tranquillity with which the young lady\r\n\r\n      received all suggestions that accused the police or that assumed the\r\n\r\n      general no longer ran any immediate danger. In short, he worked, or at\r\n\r\n      least believed he worked, to clear Natacha as he had cleared Matrena, so\r\n\r\n      that there would develop the absolute necessity of assuming a third\r\n\r\n      person\u2019s intervention in the facts disclosed so clearly by Koupriane where\r\n\r\n      Matrena or Natacha seemed alone to be possible agents. As he listened to\r\n\r\n      Natacha Rouletabille commenced to doubt and quake just as he had seen\r\n\r\n      Matrena do. The more he looked into the nature of Natacha the dizzier he\r\n\r\n      grew. What abysmal obscurities were there in her nature!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Nothing interesting happened during dinner. Several times, in spite of\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s obvious impatience with her for doing it, Matrena went up\r\n\r\n      to the general. She returned saying, \u201cHe is quiet. He doesn\u2019t sleep. He\r\n\r\n      doesn\u2019t wish anything. He has asked me to prepare his narcotic. It is too\r\n\r\n      bad. He has tried in vain, he cannot get along without it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou, too, mamma, ought to take something to make you sleep. They say\r\n\r\n      morphine is very good.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs for me,\u201d said Rouletabille, whose head for some few minutes had been\r\n\r\n      dropping now toward one shoulder and now toward another, \u201cI have no need\r\n\r\n      of any narcotic to make me sleep. If you will permit me, I will get to bed\r\n\r\n      at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh, my little domovoi doukh, I am going to carry you there in my arms.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena extended her large round arms ready to take Rouletabille as though\r\n\r\n      he had been a baby.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no. I will get up there all right alone,\u201d said Rouletabille, rising\r\n\r\n      stupidly and appearing ashamed of his excessive sleepiness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, well, let us both accompany him to his chamber,\u201d said Natacha, \u201cand I\r\n\r\n      will wish papa good-night. I\u2019m eager for bed myself. We will all make a\r\n\r\n      good night of it. Ermolai and Gniagnia will watch with the schwitzar in\r\n\r\n      the lodge. Things are reasonably arranged now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They all ascended the stairs. Rouletabille did not even go to see the\r\n\r\n      general, but threw himself on his bed. Natacha got onto the bed beside her\r\n\r\n      father, embraced him a dozen times, and went downstairs again. Matrena\r\n\r\n      followed behind her, closed doors and windows, went upstairs again to\r\n\r\n      close the door of the landing-place and found Rouletabille seated on his\r\n\r\n      bed, his arms crossed, not appearing to have any desire for sleep at all.\r\n\r\n      His face was so strangely pensive also that the anxiety of Matrena, who\r\n\r\n      had been able to make nothing out of his acts and looks all day, came back\r\n\r\n      upon her instantly in greater force than ever. She touched his arm in\r\n\r\n      order to be sure that he knew she was there.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy little friend,\u201d she said, \u201cwill you tell me now?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, madame,\u201d he replied at once. \u201cSit in that chair and listen to me.\r\n\r\n      There are things you must know at once, because we have reached a\r\n\r\n      dangerous hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe hat-pins first. The hat-pins!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille rose lightly from the bed and, facing her, but watching\r\n\r\n      something besides her, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is necessary you should know that someone almost immediately is going\r\n\r\n      to renew the attempt of the bouquet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena sprang to her feet as quickly as though she had been told there\r\n\r\n      was a bomb in the seat of her chair. She made herself sit down again,\r\n\r\n      however, in obedience to Rouletabille\u2019s urgent look commanding absolute\r\n\r\n      quiet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRenew the attempt of the bouquet!\u201d she murmured in a stifled voice. \u201cBut\r\n\r\n      there is not a flower in the general\u2019s chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe calm, madame. Understand me and answer me: You heard the tick-tack\r\n\r\n      from the bouquet while you were in your own chamber?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, with the doors open, naturally.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou told me the persons who came to say good-night to the general. At\r\n\r\n      that time there was no noise of tick-tack?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think that if there had been any tick-tack then you would have\r\n\r\n      heard it, with all those persons talking in the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hear everything. I hear everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you go downstairs at the same time those people did?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no; I remained near the general for some time, until he was sound\r\n\r\n      asleep.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you heard nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou closed the doors behind those persons?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, the door to the great staircase. The door of the servants\u2019 stairway\r\n\r\n      was condemned a long time ago; it has been locked by me, I alone have the\r\n\r\n      key and on the inside of the door opening into the general\u2019s chamber there\r\n\r\n      is also a bolt which is always shot. All the other doors of the chambers\r\n\r\n      have been condemned by me. In order to enter any of the four rooms on this\r\n\r\n      floor it is necessary now to pass by the door of my chamber, which gives\r\n\r\n      on the main staircase.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerfect. Then, no one has been able to enter the apartment. No one had\r\n\r\n      been in the apartment for at least two hours excepting you and the\r\n\r\n      general, when you heard the clockwork. From that the only conclusion is\r\n\r\n      that only the general and you could have started it going.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Matrena demanded, astounded.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI wish to prove to you by this absurd conclusion, madame, that it is\r\n\r\n      necessary never\u2014never, you understand? Never\u2014to reason solely\r\n\r\n      upon even the most evident external evidence when those\r\n\r\n      seemingly-conclusive appearances are in conflict with certain moral truths\r\n\r\n      that also are clear as the light of day. The light of day for me, madame,\r\n\r\n      is that the general does not desire to commit suicide and, above all, that\r\n\r\n      he would not choose the strange method of suicide by clockwork. The light\r\n\r\n      of day for me is that you adore your husband and that you are ready to\r\n\r\n      sacrifice your life for his.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow!\u201d exclaimed Matrena, whose tears, always ready in emotional moments,\r\n\r\n      flowed freely. \u201cBut, Holy Mary, why do you speak to me without looking at\r\n\r\n      me? What is it? What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t turn! Don\u2019t make a movement! You hear\u2014not a move! And speak\r\n\r\n      low, very low. And don\u2019t cry, for the love of God!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut you say at once... the bouquet! Come to the general\u2019s room!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot a move. And continue listening to me without interrupting,\u201d said he,\r\n\r\n      still inclining his ear, and still without looking at her. \u201cIt is because\r\n\r\n      these things were as the light of day to me that I say to myself, \u2018It is\r\n\r\n      impossible that it should be impossible for a third person not to have\r\n\r\n      placed the bomb in the bouquet. Someone is able to enter the general\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber even when the general is watching and all the doors are locked.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, no. No one could possibly enter. I swear it to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As she swore it a little too loudly, Rouletabille seized her arm so that\r\n\r\n      she almost cried out, but she understood instantly that it was to keep her\r\n\r\n      quiet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI tell you not to interrupt me, once for all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, then, tell me what you are looking at like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am watching the corner where someone is going to enter the general\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber when everything is locked, madame. Do not move!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena, her teeth chattering, recalled that when she entered\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s chamber she had found all the doors open that communicated\r\n\r\n      with the chain of rooms: the young man\u2019s chamber with hers, the\r\n\r\n      dressing-room and the general\u2019s chamber. She tried, under Rouletabille\u2019s\r\n\r\n      look, to keep calm, but in spite of all the reporter\u2019s exhortations she\r\n\r\n      could not hold her tongue.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut which way? Where will they enter?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhich door?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat of the chamber giving on the servants\u2019 stair-way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, how? The key! The bolt!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have made a key.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the bolt is drawn this side.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey will draw it back from the other side.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! That is impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille laid his two hands on Matrena\u2019s strong shoulders and\r\n\r\n      repeated, detaching each syllable, \u201cThey will draw it back from the other\r\n\r\n      side.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is impossible. I repeat it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, your Nihilists haven\u2019t invented anything. It is a trick much in\r\n\r\n      vogue with sneak thieves in hotels. All it needs is a little hole the size\r\n\r\n      of a pin bored in the panel of the door above the bolt.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGod!\u201d quavered Matrena. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean by your little\r\n\r\n      hole. Explain to me, little domovoi.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFollow me carefully, then,\u201d continued Rouletabille, his eyes all the time\r\n\r\n      fixed elsewhere. \u201cThe person who wishes to enter sticks through the hole a\r\n\r\n      brass wire that he has already given the necessary curve to and which is\r\n\r\n      fitted on its end with a light point of steel curved inward. With such an\r\n\r\n      instrument it is child\u2019s play, if the hole has been made where it ought to\r\n\r\n      be, to touch the bolt on the inside from the outside, pick the knob on it,\r\n\r\n      withdraw it, and open the door if the bolt is like this one, a small\r\n\r\n      door-bolt.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, oh, oh,\u201d moaned Matrena, who paled visibly. \u201cAnd that hole?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt exists.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have discovered it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, the first hour I was here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, domovoi! But how did you do that when you never entered the general\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber until to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoubtless, but I went up that servants\u2019 staircase much earlier than that.\r\n\r\n      And I will tell you why. When I was brought into the villa the first time,\r\n\r\n      and you watched me, bidden behind the door, do you know what I was\r\n\r\n      watching myself, while I appeared to be solely occupied digging out the\r\n\r\n      caviare? The fresh print of boot-nails which left the carpet near the\r\n\r\n      table, where someone had spilled beer (the beer was still running down the\r\n\r\n      cloth). Someone had stepped in the beer. The boot-print was not clearly\r\n\r\n      visible excepting there. But from there it went to the door of the\r\n\r\n      servants\u2019 stairway and mounted the stairs. That boot was too fine to be\r\n\r\n      mounting a stairway reserved to servants and that Koupriane told me had\r\n\r\n      been condemned, and it was that made me notice it in a moment; but just\r\n\r\n      then you entered.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou never told me anything about it. Of course if I had known there was a\r\n\r\n      boot-print...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you anything about it because I had my reasons for that,\r\n\r\n      and, anyway, the trace dried while I was telling you about my journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, why not have told me later?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know you yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSubtle devil! You will kill me. I can no longer... Let us go into the\r\n\r\n      general\u2019s chamber. We will wake him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRemain here. Remain here. I have not told you anything. That boot-print\r\n\r\n      preoccupied me, and later, when I could get away from the dining-room, I\r\n\r\n      was not easy until I had climbed that stairway myself and gone to see that\r\n\r\n      door, where I discovered what I have just told you and what I am going to\r\n\r\n      tell you now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat? What? In all you have said there has been nothing about the\r\n\r\n      hat-pins.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have come to them now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the bouquet attack, which is going to happen again? Why? Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is it. When this evening you let me go to the general\u2019s chamber, I\r\n\r\n      examined the bolt of the door without your suspecting it. My opinion was\r\n\r\n      confirmed. It was that way that the bomb was brought, and it is by that\r\n\r\n      way that someone has prepared to return.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut how? You are sure the little hole is the way someone came? But what\r\n\r\n      makes you think that is how they mean to return? You know well enough\r\n\r\n      that, not having succeeded in the general\u2019s chamber, they are at work in\r\n\r\n      the dining-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, it is probable, it is certain that they have given up the work in\r\n\r\n      the dining-room since they have commenced this very day working again in\r\n\r\n      the general\u2019s chamber. Yes, someone returned, returned that way, and I was\r\n\r\n      so sure of that, of the forthcoming return, that I removed the police in\r\n\r\n      order to be able to study everything more at my ease. Do you understand\r\n\r\n      now my confidence and why I have been able to assume so heavy a\r\n\r\n      responsibility? It is because I knew I had only one thing to watch: one\r\n\r\n      little hat-pin. It is not difficult, madame, to watch a single little\r\n\r\n      hat-pin.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA mistake,\u201d said Matrena, in a low voice. \u201cMiserable little domovoi who\r\n\r\n      told me nothing, me whom you let go to sleep on my mattress, in front of\r\n\r\n      that door that might open any moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, madame. For I was behind it!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, dear little holy angel! But what were you thinking of! That door has\r\n\r\n      not been watched this afternoon. In our absence it could have been opened.\r\n\r\n      If someone has placed a bomb during our absence!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is why I sent you at once in to the dining-room on that search that\r\n\r\n      I thought would be fruitless, dear madame. And that is why I hurried\r\n\r\n      upstairs to the bedroom. I went to the stairway door instantly. I had\r\n\r\n      prepared for proof positive if anyone had pushed it open even half a\r\n\r\n      millimeter. No, no one had touched the door in our absence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, dear heroic little friend of Jesus! But listen to me. Listen to me,\r\n\r\n      my angel. Ah, I don\u2019t know where I am or what I say. My brain is no more\r\n\r\n      than a flabby balloon punctured with pins, with little holes of hat-pins.\r\n\r\n      Tell me about the hat-pins. Right off! No, at first, what is it that makes\r\n\r\n      you believe\u2014good God!\u2014that someone will return by that door?\r\n\r\n      How can you see that, all that, in a poor little hat-pin?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, it is not a single hat-pin hole; there are two of them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwo hat-pin holes?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, two. An old one and a new one. One quite new. Why this second hole?\r\n\r\n      Because the old one was judged a little too narrow and they wished to\r\n\r\n      enlarge it, and in enlarging it they broke off the point of a hat-pin in\r\n\r\n      it. Madame, the point is there yet, filling up the little old hole and the\r\n\r\n      piece of metal is very sharp and very bright.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow I understand the examination of the hat-pins. Then it is so easy as\r\n\r\n      that to get through a door with a hat-pin?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing easier, especially if the panel is of pine. Sometimes one happens\r\n\r\n      to break the point of a pin in the first hole. Then of necessity one makes\r\n\r\n      a second. In order to commence the second hole, the point of the pin being\r\n\r\n      broken, they have used the point of a pen-knife, then have finished the\r\n\r\n      hole with the hat-pin. The second hole is still nearer the bolt than the\r\n\r\n      first one. Don\u2019t move like that, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut they are going to come! They are going to come!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe so.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I can\u2019t understand how you can remain so quiet with such a certainty.\r\n\r\n      Great heavens! what proof have you that they have not been there already?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJust an ordinary pin, madame, not a hat-pin this time. Don\u2019t confuse the\r\n\r\n      pins. I will show you in a little while.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe will drive me distracted with his pins, dear light of my eyes! Bounty\r\n\r\n      of Heaven! God\u2019s envoy! Dear little happiness-bearer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      In her transport she tried to take him in her trembling arms, but he waved\r\n\r\n      her back. She caught her breath and resumed:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid the examination of all the hat-pins tell you anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. The fifth hat-pin of Mademoiselle Natacha\u2019s, the one in the toque\r\n\r\n      out in the veranda, has the tip newly broken off.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cO misery!\u201d cried Matrena, crumpling in her chair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille raised her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat would you have? I have examined your own hat-pins. Do you think I\r\n\r\n      would have suspected you if I had found one of them broken? I would simply\r\n\r\n      have thought that someone had used your property for an abominable\r\n\r\n      purpose, that is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, that is true, that is true. Pardon me. Mother of Christ, this boy\r\n\r\n      crazes me! He consoles me and he horrifies me. He makes me think of such\r\n\r\n      dreadful things, and then he reassures me. He does what he wishes with me.\r\n\r\n      What should I become without him?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And this time she succeeded in taking his head in her two hands and\r\n\r\n      kissing him passionately. Rouletabille pushed her back roughly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou keep me from seeing,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She was in tears over his rebuff. She understood now. Rouletabille during\r\n\r\n      all this conversation had not ceased to watch through the open doors of\r\n\r\n      Matrena\u2019s room and the dressing-room the farther fatal door whose brass\r\n\r\n      bolt shone in the yellow light of the night-lamp.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At last he made her a sign and the reporter, followed by Matrena, advanced\r\n\r\n      on tip-toe to the threshold of the general\u2019s chamber, keeping close to the\r\n\r\n      wall. Feodor Feodorovitch slept. They heard his heavy breath, but he\r\n\r\n      appeared to be enjoying peaceful sleep. The horrors of the night before\r\n\r\n      had fled. Matrena was perhaps right in attributing the nightmares to the\r\n\r\n      narcotic prepared for him each night, for the glass from which he drank it\r\n\r\n      when he felt he could not sleep was still full and obviously had not been\r\n\r\n      touched. The bed of the general was so placed that whoever occupied it,\r\n\r\n      even if they were wide awake, could not see the door giving on the\r\n\r\n      servants\u2019 stairway. The little table where the glass and various phials\r\n\r\n      were placed and which had borne the dangerous bouquet, was placed near the\r\n\r\n      bed, a little back of it, and nearer the door. Nothing would have been\r\n\r\n      easier than for someone who could open the door to stretch an arm and\r\n\r\n      place the infernal machine among the wild flowers, above all, as could\r\n\r\n      easily be believed, if he had waited for that treachery until the heavy\r\n\r\n      breathing of the general told them outside that he was fast asleep, and\r\n\r\n      if, looking through the key-hole, he had made sure Matrena was occupied in\r\n\r\n      her own chamber. Rouletabille, at the threshold, glided to one side, out\r\n\r\n      of the line of view from the hole, and got down on all fours. He crawled\r\n\r\n      toward the door. With his head to the floor he made sure that the little\r\n\r\n      ordinary pin which he had placed on guard that evening, stuck in the floor\r\n\r\n      against the door, was still erect, having thus additional proof that the\r\n\r\n      door had not been moved. In any other case the pin would have lain flat on\r\n\r\n      the floor. He crept back, rose to his feet, passed into the dressing-room\r\n\r\n      and, in a corner, had a rapid conversation in a low voice with Matrena.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will go,\u201d said he, \u201cand take your mattress into the corner of the\r\n\r\n      dressing-room where you can still see the door but no one can see you by\r\n\r\n      looking through the key-hole. Do that quite naturally, and then go to your\r\n\r\n      rest. I will pass the night on the mattress, and I beg you to believe that\r\n\r\n      I will be more comfortable there than on a bed of staircase wood where I\r\n\r\n      spent the night last night, behind the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, but you will fall asleep. I don\u2019t wish that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you thinking, madame?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t wish it. I don\u2019t wish it. I don\u2019t wish to quit the door where the\r\n\r\n      eye is. And since I\u2019m not able to sleep, let me watch.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He did not insist, and they crouched together on the mattress.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was squatted like a tailor at work; but Matrena remained on\r\n\r\n      all-fours, her jaw out, her eyes fixed, like a bulldog ready to spring.\r\n\r\n      The minutes passed by in profound silence, broken only by the irregular\r\n\r\n      breathing and puffing of the general. His face stood out pallid and tragic\r\n\r\n      on the pillow; his mouth was open and, at times, the lips moved. There was\r\n\r\n      fear at any moment of nightmare or his awakening. Unconsciously he threw\r\n\r\n      an arm over toward the table where the glass of narcotic stood. Then he\r\n\r\n      lay still again and snored lightly. The night-lamp on the mantelpiece\r\n\r\n      caught queer yellow reflections from the corners of the furniture, from\r\n\r\n      the gilded frame of a picture on the wall and from the phials and glasses\r\n\r\n      on the table. But in all the chamber Matrena Petrovna saw nothing, thought\r\n\r\n      of nothing but the brass bolt which shone there on the door. Tired of\r\n\r\n      being on her knees, she shifted, her chin in her hands, her gaze steadily\r\n\r\n      fixed. As time passed and nothing happened she heaved a sigh. She could\r\n\r\n      not have said whether she hoped for or dreaded the coming of that\r\n\r\n      something new which Rouletabille had indicated. Rouletabille felt her\r\n\r\n      shiver with anguish and impatience.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As for him, he had not hoped that anything would come to pass until toward\r\n\r\n      dawn, the moment, as everyone knows, when deep sleep is most apt to\r\n\r\n      vanquish all watchfulness and all insomnia. And as he waited for that\r\n\r\n      moment he had not budged any more than a Chinese ape or the dear little\r\n\r\n      porcelain domovoi doukh in the garden. Of course it might be that it was\r\n\r\n      not to happen this night.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly Matrena\u2019s hand fell on Rouletabille\u2019s. His imprisoned hers so\r\n\r\n      firmly that she understood she was forbidden to make the least movement.\r\n\r\n      And both, with necks extended, ears erect, watched like beasts, like\r\n\r\n      beasts on the scent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Yes, yes, there had been a slight noise in the lock. A key turned, softly,\r\n\r\n      softly, in the lock, and then\u2014silence; and then another little\r\n\r\n      noise, a grinding sound, a slight grating of wire, above, then on the\r\n\r\n      bolt; upon the bolt which shone in the subdued glow of the night-lamp. The\r\n\r\n      bolt softly, very softly, slipped slowly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then the door was pushed slowly, so slowly. It opened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Through the opening the shadow of an arm stretched, an arm which held in\r\n\r\n      its fingers something which shone. Rouletabille felt Matrena ready to\r\n\r\n      bound. He encircled her, he pressed her in his arms, he restrained her in\r\n\r\n      silence, and he had a horrible fear of hearing her suddenly shout, while\r\n\r\n      the arm stretched out, almost touched the pillow on the bed where the\r\n\r\n      general continued to sleep a sleep of peace such as he had not known for a\r\n\r\n      long time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      VII. ARSENATE OF SODA\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The mysterious hand held a phial and poured the entire contents into the\r\n\r\n      potion. Then the hand withdrew as it had come, slowly, prudently, slyly,\r\n\r\n      and the key turned in the lock and the bolt slipped back into place.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Like a wolf, Rouletabille, warning Matrena for a last time not to budge,\r\n\r\n      gained the landing-place, bounded towards the stairs, slid down the\r\n\r\n      banister right to the veranda, crossed the drawing-room like a flash, and\r\n\r\n      reached the little sitting-room without having jostled a single piece of\r\n\r\n      furniture. He noticed nothing, saw nothing. All around was undisturbed and\r\n\r\n      silent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The first light of dawn filtered through the blinds. He was able to make\r\n\r\n      out that the only closed door was the one to Natacha\u2019s chamber. He stopped\r\n\r\n      before that door, his heart beating, and listened. But no sound came to\r\n\r\n      his ear. He had glided so lightly over the carpet that he was sure he had\r\n\r\n      not been heard. Perhaps that door would open. He waited. In vain. It\r\n\r\n      seemed to him there was nothing alive in that house except his heart. He\r\n\r\n      was stifled with the horror that he glimpsed, that he almost touched,\r\n\r\n      although that door remained closed. He felt along the wall in order to\r\n\r\n      reach the window, and pulled aside the curtain. Window and blinds of the\r\n\r\n      little room giving on the Neva were closed. The bar of iron inside was in\r\n\r\n      its place. Then he went to the passage, mounted and descended the narrow\r\n\r\n      servants\u2019 stairway, looked all about, in all the rooms, feeling everywhere\r\n\r\n      with silent hands, assuring himself that no lock had been tampered with.\r\n\r\n      On his return to the veranda, as he raised his head, he saw at the top of\r\n\r\n      the main staircase a figure wan as death, a spectral apparition amid the\r\n\r\n      shadows of the passing night, who leaned toward him. It was Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna. She came down, silent as a phantom and he no longer recognized\r\n\r\n      her voice when she demanded of him, \u201cWhere? I require that you tell me.\r\n\r\n      Where?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have looked everywhere,\u201d he said, so low that Matrena had to come\r\n\r\n      nearer to understand his whisper. \u201cEverything is shut tight. And there is\r\n\r\n      no one about.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena looked at Rouletabille with all the power of her eyes, as though\r\n\r\n      she would discover his inmost thoughts, but his clear glance did not\r\n\r\n      waver, and she saw there was nothing he wished to hide. Then Matrena\r\n\r\n      pointed her finger at Natacha\u2019s chamber.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have not gone in there?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He replied, \u201cIt is not necessary to enter there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will enter there, myself, nevertheless,\u201d said she, and she set her\r\n\r\n      teeth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He barred her way with his arms spread out.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you hold the life of someone dear,\u201d said he, \u201cdon\u2019t go a step\r\n\r\n      farther.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the person is in that chamber. The person is there! It is there you\r\n\r\n      will find out!\u201d And she waved him aside with a gesture as though she were\r\n\r\n      sleepwalking.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      To recall her to the reality of what he had said to her and to make her\r\n\r\n      understand what he desired, he had to grip her wrist in the vice of his\r\n\r\n      nervous hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe person is not there, perhaps,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cUnderstand me now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But she did not understand him. She said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince the person is nowhere else, the person must be there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Rouletabille continued obstinately:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no. Perhaps he is gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGone! And everything locked on the inside!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is not a reason,\u201d he replied.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But she could not follow his thoughts any further. She wished absolutely\r\n\r\n      to make her way into Natacha\u2019s chamber. The obsession of that was upon\r\n\r\n      her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you enter there,\u201d said he, \u201cand if (as is most probable) you don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      find what you seek there, all is lost! And as to me, I give up the whole\r\n\r\n      thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She sank in a heap onto a chair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t despair,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She shook her poor old head dejectedly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe know that only she is here, since no one has been able to enter and\r\n\r\n      since no one has been able to leave.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That, in truth, filled her brain, prevented her from discerning in any\r\n\r\n      corner of her mind the thought of Rouletabille. Then the impossible\r\n\r\n      dialogue resumed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI repeat that we do not know but that the person has gone,\u201d repeated the\r\n\r\n      reporter, and demanded her keys.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFoolish,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you want them for?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo search outside as we have searched inside.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, everything is locked on the inside!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, once more, that is no reason that the person may not be outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He consumed five minutes opening the door of the veranda, so many were his\r\n\r\n      precautions. She watched him impatiently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He whispered to her:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am going out, but don\u2019t you lose sight of the little sitting-room. At\r\n\r\n      the least movement call me; fire a revolver if you need to.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He slipped into the garden with the same precautions for silence. From the\r\n\r\n      corner that she kept to, through the doors left open, Matrena could follow\r\n\r\n      all the movements of the reporter and watch Natacha\u2019s chamber at the same\r\n\r\n      time. The attitude of Rouletabille continued to confuse her beyond all\r\n\r\n      expression. She watched what he did as if she thought him besotted. The\r\n\r\n      dyernick on guard out in the roadway also watched the young man through\r\n\r\n      the bars of the gate in consternation, as though he thought him a fool.\r\n\r\n      Along the paths of beaten earth or cement which offered no chance for\r\n\r\n      footprints Rouletabille hurried silently. Around him he noted that the\r\n\r\n      grass of the lawn had not been trodden. And then he paid no more attention\r\n\r\n      to his steps. He seemed to study attentively the rosy color in the east,\r\n\r\n      breathing the delicacy of dawning morning in the Isles, amid the silence\r\n\r\n      of the earth, which still slumbered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Bare-headed, face thrown back, hands behind his back, eyes raised and\r\n\r\n      fixed, he made a few steps, then suddenly stopped as if he had been given\r\n\r\n      an electric shock. As soon as he seemed to have recovered from that shock\r\n\r\n      he turned around and went a few steps back to another path, into which he\r\n\r\n      advanced, straight ahead, his face high, with the same fixed look that he\r\n\r\n      had had up to the time he so suddenly stopped, as if something or someone\r\n\r\n      advised or warned him not to go further. He continually worked back toward\r\n\r\n      the house, and thus he traversed all the paths that led from the villa,\r\n\r\n      but in all these excursions he took pains not to place himself in the\r\n\r\n      field of vision from Natacha\u2019s window, a restricted field because of its\r\n\r\n      location just around an abutment of the building. To ascertain about this\r\n\r\n      window he crept on all-fours up to the garden-edge that ran along the foot\r\n\r\n      of the wall and had sufficient proof that no one had jumped out that way.\r\n\r\n      Then he went to rejoin Matrena in the veranda.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo one has come into the garden this morning,\u201d said he, \u201cand no one has\r\n\r\n      gone out of the villa into the garden. Now I am going to look outside the\r\n\r\n      grounds. Wait here; I\u2019ll be back in five minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He went away, knocked discreetly on the window of the lodge and waited\r\n\r\n      some seconds. Ermolai came out and opened the gate for him. Matrena moved\r\n\r\n      to the threshold of the little sitting-room and watched Natacha\u2019s door\r\n\r\n      with horror. She felt her legs give under her, she could not stand up\r\n\r\n      under the diabolic thought of such a crime. Ah, that arm, that arm!\r\n\r\n      reaching out, making its way, with a little shining phial in its hand.\r\n\r\n      Pains of Christ! What could there be in the damnable books over which\r\n\r\n      Natacha and her companions pored that could make such abominable crimes\r\n\r\n      possible? Ah, Natacha, Natacha! it was from her that she would have\r\n\r\n      desired the answer, straining her almost to stifling on her rough bosom\r\n\r\n      and strangling her with her own strong hand that she might not hear the\r\n\r\n      response. Ah, Natacha, Natacha, whom she had loved so much! She sank to\r\n\r\n      the floor, crept across the carpet to the door, and lay there, stretched\r\n\r\n      like a beast, and buried her head in her arms while she wept over her\r\n\r\n      daughter. Natacha, Natacha, whom she had cherished as her own child, and\r\n\r\n      who did not hear her. Ah, what use that the little fellow had gone to\r\n\r\n      search outside when the whole truth lay behind this door? Thinking of him,\r\n\r\n      she was embarrassed lest he should find her in that animalistic posture,\r\n\r\n      and she rose to her knees and worked her way over to the window that\r\n\r\n      looked out upon the Neva. The angle of the slanting blinds let her see\r\n\r\n      well enough what passed outside, and what she saw made her spring to her\r\n\r\n      feet. Below her the reporter was going through the same incomprehensible\r\n\r\n      maneuvers that she had seen him do in the garden. Three pathways led to\r\n\r\n      the little road that ran along the wall of the villa by the bank of the\r\n\r\n      Neva. The young man, still with his hands behind his back and with his\r\n\r\n      face up, took them one after the other. In the first he stopped at the\r\n\r\n      first step. He didn\u2019t take more than two steps in the second. In the\r\n\r\n      third, which cut obliquely toward the right and seemed to run to the bank\r\n\r\n      nearest Krestowsky Ostrow, she saw him advance slowly at first, then more\r\n\r\n      quickly among the small trees and hedges. Once only he stopped and looked\r\n\r\n      closely at the trunk of a tree against which he seemed to pick out\r\n\r\n      something invisible, and then he continued to the bank. There he sat down\r\n\r\n      on a stone and appeared to reflect, and then suddenly he cast off his\r\n\r\n      jacket and trousers, picked out a certain place on the bank across from\r\n\r\n      him, finished undressing and plunged into the stream. She saw at once that\r\n\r\n      he swam like a porpoise, keeping beneath and showing his head from time to\r\n\r\n      time, breathing, then diving below the surface again. He reached\r\n\r\n      Krestowsky Ostrow in a clump of reeds. Then he disappeared. Below him,\r\n\r\n      surrounded by trees, could be seen the red tiles of the villa which\r\n\r\n      sheltered Boris and Michael. From that villa a person could see the window\r\n\r\n      of the sitting-room in General Trebassof\u2019s residence, but not what might\r\n\r\n      occur along the bank of the river just below its walls. An isvotchick\r\n\r\n      drove along the distant route of Krestowsky, conveying in his carriage a\r\n\r\n      company of young officers and young women who had been feasting and who\r\n\r\n      sang as they rode; then deep silence ensued. Matrena\u2019s eyes searched for\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, but could not find him. How long was he going to stay hidden\r\n\r\n      like that? She pressed her face against the chill window. What was she\r\n\r\n      waiting for? She waited perhaps for someone to make a move on this side,\r\n\r\n      for the door near her to open and the traitorous figure of The Other to\r\n\r\n      appear.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      A hand touched her carefully. She turned.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was there, his face all scarred by red scratches, without\r\n\r\n      collar or neck-tie, having hastily resumed his clothes. He appeared\r\n\r\n      furious as he surprised her in his disarray. She let him lead her as\r\n\r\n      though she were a child. He drew her to his room and closed the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame,\u201d he commenced, \u201cit is impossible to work with you. Why in the\r\n\r\n      world have you wept not two feet from your step-daughter\u2019s door? You and\r\n\r\n      your Koupriane, you commence to make me regret the Faubourg Poissoniere,\r\n\r\n      you know. Your step-daughter has certainly heard you. It is lucky that she\r\n\r\n      attaches no importance at all to your nocturnal phantasmagorias, and that\r\n\r\n      she has been used to them a long time. She has more sense than you,\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Natacha has. She sleeps, or at least she pretends to sleep,\r\n\r\n      which leaves everybody in peace. What reply will you give her if it\r\n\r\n      happens that she asks you the reason to-day for your marching and\r\n\r\n      counter-marching up and down the sitting-room and complains that you kept\r\n\r\n      her from sleeping?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena only shook her old, old head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, she has not heard me. I was there like a shadow, like a shadow of\r\n\r\n      myself. She will never hear me. No one hears a shadow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille felt returning pity for her and spoke more gently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn any case, it is necessary, you must understand, that she should attach\r\n\r\n      no more importance to what you have done to-night than to the things she\r\n\r\n      knows of your doing other nights. It is not the first time, is it, that\r\n\r\n      you have wandered in the sitting-room? You understand me? And to-morrow,\r\n\r\n      madame, embrace her as you always have.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, not that,\u201d she moaned. \u201cNever that. I could not.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena did not reply. She wept. He took her in his arms like a child\r\n\r\n      consoling its mother.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. All is not lost. Someone did leave the villa this\r\n\r\n      morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, little domovoi! How is that? How is that? How did you find that out?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince we didn\u2019t find anything inside, it was certainly necessary to find\r\n\r\n      something outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you have found it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Virgin protect you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSHE is with us. She will not desert us. I will even say that I believe\r\n\r\n      she has a special guardianship over the Isles. She watches over them from\r\n\r\n      evening to morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly. You don\u2019t know what we call in France \u2018the watchers of the\r\n\r\n      Virgin\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, yes, they are the webs that the dear little beasts of the good God\r\n\r\n      spin between the trees and that...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. You understand me and you will understand further when you know\r\n\r\n      that in the garden the first thing that struck me across the face as I\r\n\r\n      went into it was these watchers of the Virgin spun by the dear little\r\n\r\n      spiders of the good God. At first when I felt them on my face I said to\r\n\r\n      myself, \u2018Hold on, no one has passed this way,\u2019 and so I went to search\r\n\r\n      other places. The webs stopped me everywhere in the garden. But, outside\r\n\r\n      the garden, they kept out of the way and let me pass undisturbed down a\r\n\r\n      pathway which led to the Neva. So then I said to myself, \u2018Now, has the\r\n\r\n      Virgin by accident overlooked her work in this pathway? Surely not.\r\n\r\n      Someone has ruined it.\u2019 I found the shreds of them hanging to the bushes,\r\n\r\n      and so I reached the river.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you threw yourself into the river, my dear angel. You swim like a\r\n\r\n      little god.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd I landed where the other landed. Yes, there were the reeds all\r\n\r\n      freshly broken. And I slipped in among the bushes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere to?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cUp to the Villa Krestowsky, madame\u2014where they both live.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, it was from there someone came?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      There was a silence between them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She questioned:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBoris?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSomeone who came from the villa and who returned there. Boris or Michael,\r\n\r\n      or another. They went and returned through the reeds. But in coming they\r\n\r\n      used a boat; they returned by swimming.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Her customary agitation reasserted itself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She demanded ardently:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you are sure that he came here and that he left here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I am sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the sitting-room window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is impossible, for we found it locked.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is possible, if someone closed it behind him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She commenced to tremble again, and, falling back into her nightmarish\r\n\r\n      horror, she no longer wasted fond expletives on her domovoi as on a dear\r\n\r\n      little angel who had just rendered a service ten times more precious to\r\n\r\n      her than life. While he listened patiently, she said brutally:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy did you keep me from throwing myself on him, from rushing upon him as\r\n\r\n      he opened the door? Ah, I would have, I would have... we would know.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo. At the least noise he would have closed the door. A turn of the key\r\n\r\n      and he would have escaped forever. And he would have been warned.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCareless boy! Why then, if you knew he was going to come, didn\u2019t you\r\n\r\n      leave me in the bedroom and you watch below yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause so long as I was below he would not have come. He only comes when\r\n\r\n      there is no one downstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, Saints Peter and Paul pity a poor woman. Who do you think it is,\r\n\r\n      then? Who do you think it is? I can\u2019t think any more. Tell me, tell me\r\n\r\n      that. You ought to know\u2014you know everything. Come\u2014who? I\r\n\r\n      demand the truth. Who? Still some agent of the Committee, of the Central\r\n\r\n      Committee? Still the Nihilists?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf it was only that!\u201d said Rouletabille quietly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have sworn to drive me mad! What do you mean by your \u2018if it was only\r\n\r\n      that\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, imperturbable, did not reply.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat have you done with the potion?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe potion? The glass of the crime! I have locked it in my room, in the\r\n\r\n      cupboard\u2014safe, safe!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, but, madame, it is necessary to replace it where you took it from.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, after having poured the poison into a phial, to wash the glass and\r\n\r\n      fill it with another potion.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are right. You think of everything. If the general wakes and wants\r\n\r\n      his potion, he must not be suspicious of anything, and he must be able to\r\n\r\n      have his drink.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is not necessary that he should drink.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, why have the drink there?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo that the person can be sure, madame, that if he has not drunk it is\r\n\r\n      simply because he has not wished to. A pure chance, madame, that he is not\r\n\r\n      poisoned. You understand me this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes. O Christ! But how now, if the general wakes and wishes to drink\r\n\r\n      his narcotic?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTell him I forbid it. And here is another thing you must do. When\u2014Someone\u2014comes\r\n\r\n      into the general\u2019s chamber, in the morning, you must quite openly and\r\n\r\n      naturally throw out the potion, useless and vapid, you see, and so Someone\r\n\r\n      will have no right to be astonished that the general continues to enjoy\r\n\r\n      excellent health.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, little one; you are wiser than King Solomon. And what will I do\r\n\r\n      with the phial of poison?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBring it to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRight away.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She went for it and returned five minutes later.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is still asleep. I have put the glass on the table, out of his reach.\r\n\r\n      He will have to call me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good. Then push the door to, close it; we have to talk things over.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut if someone goes back up the servants\u2019 staircase?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe easy about that. They think the general is poisoned already. It is the\r\n\r\n      first care-free moment I have been able to enjoy in this house.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen will you stop making me shake with horror, little demon! You keep\r\n\r\n      your secret well, I must say. The general is sleeping better than if he\r\n\r\n      really were poisoned. But what shall we do about Natacha? I dare ask you\r\n\r\n      that\u2014you and you alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow\u2014nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe will watch her...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, yes, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill, Matrena, you let me watch her by myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, I promise you. I will not pay any attention to her. That is\r\n\r\n      promised. That is promised. Do as you please. Why, just now, when I spoke\r\n\r\n      of the Nihilists to you, did you say, \u2018If it were only that!\u2019? You\r\n\r\n      believe, then, that she is not a Nihilist? She reads such things\u2014things\r\n\r\n      like on the barricades...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame, madame, you think of nothing but Natacha. You have promised me\r\n\r\n      not to watch her; promise me not to think about her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, why did you say, \u2018If it was only that!\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause, if there were only Nihilists in your affair, dear madame, it\r\n\r\n      would be too simple, or, rather, it would have been more simple. Can you\r\n\r\n      possibly believe, madame, that simply a Nihilist, a Nihilist who was only\r\n\r\n      a Nihilist, would take pains that his bomb exploded from a vase of\r\n\r\n      flowers?\u2014that it would have mattered where, so long as it\r\n\r\n      overwhelmed the general? Do you imagine that the bomb would have had less\r\n\r\n      effect behind the door than in front of it? And the little cavity under\r\n\r\n      the floor, do you believe that a genuine revolutionary, such as you have\r\n\r\n      here in Russia, would amuse himself by penetrating to the villa only to\r\n\r\n      draw out two nails from a board, when one happens to give him time between\r\n\r\n      two visits to the dining-room? Do you suppose that a revolutionary who\r\n\r\n      wished to avenge the dead of Moscow and who could succeed in getting so\r\n\r\n      far as the door behind which General Trebassof slept would amuse himself\r\n\r\n      by making a little hole with a pin in order to draw back the bolt and\r\n\r\n      amuse himself by pouring poison into a glass? Why, in such a case, he\r\n\r\n      would have thrown his bomb outright, whether it blew him up along with the\r\n\r\n      villa, or he was arrested on the spot, or had to submit to the martyrdom\r\n\r\n      of the dungeons in the Fortress of SS. Peter and Paul, or be hung at\r\n\r\n      Schlusselburg. Isn\u2019t that what always happens? That is the way he would\r\n\r\n      have done, and not have acted like a hotel-rat! Now, there is someone in\r\n\r\n      your home (or who comes to your home) who acts like a hotel-rat because he\r\n\r\n      does not wish to be seen, because he does not wish to be discovered,\r\n\r\n      because he does not wish to be taken in the act. Now, the moment that he\r\n\r\n      fears nothing so much as to be taken in the act, so that he plays all\r\n\r\n      these tricks of legerdemain, it is certain that his object lies beyond the\r\n\r\n      act itself, beyond the bomb, beyond the poison. Why all this necessity for\r\n\r\n      bombs of deferred explosion, for clockwork placed where it will be\r\n\r\n      confused with other things, and not on a bare staircase forbidden to\r\n\r\n      everybody, though you visit it twenty times a day?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut this man comes in as he pleases by day and by night? You don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      answer. You know who he is, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know him, perhaps, but I am not sure who it is yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are not curious, little domovoi doukh! A friend of the house,\r\n\r\n      certainly, and who enters the house as he wishes, by night, because\r\n\r\n      someone opens the window for him. And who comes from the Krestowsky Villa!\r\n\r\n      Boris or Michael! Ah, poor miserable Matrena! Why don\u2019t they kill poor\r\n\r\n      Matrena? Their general! Their general! And they are soldiers\u2014soldiers\r\n\r\n      who come at night to kill their general. Aided by\u2014by whom? Do you\r\n\r\n      believe that? You? Light of my eyes! you believe that! No, no, that is not\r\n\r\n      possible! I want you to understand, monsieur le domovoi, that I am not\r\n\r\n      able to believe anything so horrible. No, no, by Jesus Christ Who died on\r\n\r\n      the Cross, and Who searches our hearts, I do not believe that Boris\u2014who,\r\n\r\n      however, has very advanced ideas, I admit\u2014it is necessary not to\r\n\r\n      forget that; very advanced; and who composes very advanced verses also, as\r\n\r\n      I have always told him\u2014I will not believe that Boris is capable of\r\n\r\n      such a fearful crime. As to Michael, he is an honest man, and my daughter,\r\n\r\n      my Natacha, is an honest girl. Everything looks very bad, truly, but I do\r\n\r\n      not suspect either Michael or Boris or my pure and beloved Natacha (even\r\n\r\n      though she has made a translation into French of very advanced verses,\r\n\r\n      certainly most improper for the daughter of a general). That is what lies\r\n\r\n      at the bottom of my mind, the bottom of my heart\u2014you have understood\r\n\r\n      me perfectly, little angel of paradise? Ah, it is you the general owes his\r\n\r\n      life to, that Matrena owes her life. Without you this house would already\r\n\r\n      be a coffin. How shall I ever reward you? You wish for nothing! I annoy\r\n\r\n      you! You don\u2019t even listen to me! A coffin\u2014we would all be in our\r\n\r\n      coffins! Tell me what you desire. All that I have belongs to you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI desire to smoke a pipe.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, a pipe! Do you want some yellow perfumed tobacco that I receive every\r\n\r\n      month from Constantinople, a treat right from the harem? I will get enough\r\n\r\n      for you, if you like it, to smoke ten thousand pipes full.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI prefer caporal,\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cBut you are right. It is not\r\n\r\n      wise to suspect anybody. See, watch, wait. There is always time, once the\r\n\r\n      game is caught, to say whether it is a hare or a wild boar. Listen to me,\r\n\r\n      then, my good mamma. We must know first what is in the phial. Where is\r\n\r\n      it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She drew it from her sleeve. He stowed it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou wish the general a good appetite, for me. I am going out. I will be\r\n\r\n      back in two hours at the latest. And, above all, don\u2019t let the general\r\n\r\n      know anything. I am going to see one of my friends who lives in the\r\n\r\n      Aptiekarski pereolek.\u201d *\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDepend on me, and get back quickly for love of me. My blood clogs in my\r\n\r\n      heart when you are not here, dear servant of God.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She mounted to the general\u2019s room and came down at least ten times to see\r\n\r\n      if Rouletabille had not returned. Two hours later he was around the villa,\r\n\r\n      as he had promised. She could not keep herself from running to meet him,\r\n\r\n      for which she was scolded.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe calm. Be calm. Do you know what was in the phial?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cArsenate of soda, enough to kill ten people.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHoly Mary!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe quiet. Go upstairs to the general.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Feodor Feodorovitch was in charming humor. It was his first good night\r\n\r\n      since the death of the youth of Moscow. He attributed it to his not having\r\n\r\n      touched the narcotic and resolved, once more, to give up the narcotic, a\r\n\r\n      resolve Rouletabille and Matrena encouraged. During the conversation there\r\n\r\n      was a knock at the door of Matrena\u2019s chamber. She ran to see who was\r\n\r\n      there, and returned with Natacha, who wished to embrace her father. Her\r\n\r\n      face showed traces of fatigue. Certainly she had not passed as good a\r\n\r\n      night as her father, and the general reproached her for looking so\r\n\r\n      downcast.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is true. I had dreadful dreams. But you, papa, did you sleep well? Did\r\n\r\n      you take your narcotic?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, I have not touched a drop of my potion.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I see. Oh, well, that is all right; that is very good. Natural sleep\r\n\r\n      must be coming back...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena, as though hypnotized by Rouletabille, had taken the glass from\r\n\r\n      the table and ostentatiously carried it to the dressing-room to throw it\r\n\r\n      out, and she delayed there to recover her self-possession.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will see, papa, that you will be able to live just like everyone else\r\n\r\n      finally. The great thing was to clear away the police, the atrocious\r\n\r\n      police; wasn\u2019t it, Monsieur Rouletabille?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have always said, for myself, that I am entirely of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s mind. You can be entirely reassured now, and I shall leave you\r\n\r\n      feeling reassured. Yes, I must think of getting my interviews done\r\n\r\n      quickly, and departing. Ah well, I can only say what I think. Run things\r\n\r\n      yourselves and you will not run any danger. Besides, the general gets much\r\n\r\n      better, and soon I shall see you all in France, I hope. I must thank you\r\n\r\n      now for your friendly hospitality.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, but you are not going? You are not going!\u201d Matrena had already set\r\n\r\n      herself to protest with all the strenuous torrent of words in her poor\r\n\r\n      desolated heart, when a glance from the reporter cut short her despairing\r\n\r\n      utterances.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall have to remain a week still in the city. I have engaged a chamber\r\n\r\n      at the Hotel de France. It is necessary. I have so many people to see and\r\n\r\n      to receive. I will come to make you a little visit from time to time.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are then quite easy,\u201d demanded the general gravely, \u201cat leaving me\r\n\r\n      all alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEntirely easy. And, besides, I don\u2019t leave you all alone. I leave you\r\n\r\n      with Madame Trebassof and Mademoiselle. I repeat: All three of you stay as\r\n\r\n      I see you now. No more police, or, in any case, the fewest possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is right, he is right,\u201d repeated Natacha again.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At this moment there were fresh knocks at the door of Matrena\u2019s chamber.\r\n\r\n      It was Ermolai, who announced that his Excellency the Marshal of the\r\n\r\n      Court, Count Keltzof, wished to see the general, acting for His Majesty.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo and receive the Count, Natacha, and tell him that your father will be\r\n\r\n      downstairs in a moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha and Rouletabille went down and found the Count in the\r\n\r\n      drawing-room. He was a magnificent specimen, handsome and big as one of\r\n\r\n      the Swiss papal guard. He seemed watchful in all directions and all among\r\n\r\n      the furniture, and was quite evidently disquieted. He advanced immediately\r\n\r\n      to meet the young lady, inquiring the news.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is all good news,\u201d replied Natacha. \u201cEverybody here is splendid. The\r\n\r\n      general is quite gay. But what news have you, monsieur le marechal? You\r\n\r\n      appear preoccupied.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The marshal had pressed Rouletabille\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd my grapes?\u201d he demanded of Natacha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow, your grapes? What grapes?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you have not touched them, so much the better. I arrived here very\r\n\r\n      anxious. I brought you yesterday, from Krasnoie-Coelo, some of the\r\n\r\n      Emperor\u2019s grapes that Feodor Feodorovitch enjoyed so much. Now this\r\n\r\n      morning I learned that the eldest son of Doucet, the French head-gardener\r\n\r\n      of the Imperial conservatories at Krasnoie, had died from eating those\r\n\r\n      grapes, which he had taken from those gathered for me to bring here.\r\n\r\n      Imagine my dismay. I knew, however, that at the general\u2019s table, grapes\r\n\r\n      would not be eaten without having been washed, but I reproached myself for\r\n\r\n      not having taken the precaution of leaving word that Doucet recommend that\r\n\r\n      they be washed thoroughly. Still, I don\u2019t suppose it would matter. I\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t see how my gift could be dangerous, but when I learned of little\r\n\r\n      Doucet\u2019s death this morning, I jumped into the first train and came\r\n\r\n      straight here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, your Excellency,\u201d interrupted Natacha, \u201cwe have not seen your\r\n\r\n      grapes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, they have not been served yet? All the better. Thank goodness!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s grapes are diseased, then?\u201d interrogated Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n      \u201cPhylloxera pest has got into the conservatories?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing can stop it, Doucet told me. So he didn\u2019t want me to leave last\r\n\r\n      evening until he had washed the grapes. Unfortunately, I was pressed for\r\n\r\n      time and I took them as they were, without any idea that the mixture they\r\n\r\n      spray on the grapes to protect them was so deadly. It appears that in the\r\n\r\n      vineyard country they have such accidents every year. They call it, I\r\n\r\n      think, the... the mixture...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Bordeaux mixture,\u201d was heard in Rouletabille\u2019s trembling voice \u201cAnd\r\n\r\n      do you know what it is, Your Excellency, this Bordeaux mixture?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, no.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At this moment the general came down the stairs, clinging to the banister\r\n\r\n      and supported by Matrena Petrovna.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d continued Rouletabille, watching Natacha, \u201cthe Bordeaux mixture\r\n\r\n      which covered the grapes you brought the general yesterday was nothing\r\n\r\n      more nor less than arsenate of soda.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, God!\u201d cried Natacha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As for Matrena Petrovna, she uttered a low exclamation and let go the\r\n\r\n      general, who almost fell down the staircase. Everybody rushed. The general\r\n\r\n      laughed. Matrena, under the stringent look of Rouletabille, stammered that\r\n\r\n      she had suddenly felt faint. At last they were all together in the\r\n\r\n      veranda. The general settled back on his sofa and inquired:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, now, were you just saying something, my dear marshal, about some\r\n\r\n      grapes you have brought me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Natacha, quite frightened, \u201cand what he said isn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      pleasant at all. The son of Doucet, the court gardener, has just been\r\n\r\n      poisoned by the same grapes that monsieur le marschal, it appears, brought\r\n\r\n      you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere was this? Grapes? What grapes? I haven\u2019t seen any grapes!\u201d\r\n\r\n       exclaimed Matrena. \u201cI noticed you, yesterday, marshal, out in the garden,\r\n\r\n      but you went away almost immediately, and I certainly was surprised that\r\n\r\n      you did not come in. What is this story?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, we must clear this matter up. It is absolutely necessary that we\r\n\r\n      know what happened to those grapes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cthey could cause a catastrophe.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf it has not happened already,\u201d fretted the marshal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut how? Where are they? Whom did you give them to?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI carried them in a white cardboard box, the first one that came to hand\r\n\r\n      in Doucet\u2019s place. I came here the first time and didn\u2019t find you. I\r\n\r\n      returned again with the box, and the general was just lying down. I was\r\n\r\n      pressed for my train and Michael Nikolaievitch and Boris Alexandrovitch\r\n\r\n      were in the garden, so I asked them to execute my commission, and I laid\r\n\r\n      the box down near them on the little garden table, telling them not to\r\n\r\n      forget to tell you it was necessary to wash the grapes as Doucet expressly\r\n\r\n      recommended.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it is unbelievable! It is terrible!\u201d quavered Matrena. \u201cWhere can the\r\n\r\n      grapes be? We must know.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d approved Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must ask Boris and Michael,\u201d said Natacha. \u201cGood God! surely they have\r\n\r\n      not eaten them! Perhaps they are sick.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere they are,\u201d said the general. All turned. Michael and Boris were\r\n\r\n      coming up the steps. Rouletabille, who was in a shadowed corner under the\r\n\r\n      main staircase, did not lose a single play of muscle on the two faces\r\n\r\n      which for him were two problems to solve. Both faces were smiling; too\r\n\r\n      smiling, perhaps.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMichael! Boris! Come here,\u201d cried Feodor Feodorovitch. \u201cWhat have you\r\n\r\n      done with the grapes from monsieur le marechal?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They both looked at him upon this brusque interrogation, seemed not to\r\n\r\n      understand, and then, suddenly recalling, they declared very naturally\r\n\r\n      that they had left them on the garden table and had not thought about\r\n\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou forgot my caution, then?\u201d said Count Kaltzof severely.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat caution?\u201d said Boris. \u201cOh, yes, the washing of the grapes. Doucet\u2019s\r\n\r\n      caution.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you know what has happened to Doucet with those grapes? His eldest son\r\n\r\n      is dead, poisoned. Do you understand now why we are anxious to know what\r\n\r\n      has become of my grapes?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut they ought to be out there on the table,\u201d said Michael.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo one can find them anywhere,\u201d declared Matrena, who, no less than\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, watched every change in the countenances of the two\r\n\r\n      officers. \u201cHow did it happen that you went away yesterday evening without\r\n\r\n      saying good-bye, without seeing us, without troubling yourselves whether\r\n\r\n      or not the general might need you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame,\u201d said Michael, coldly, in military fashion, as though he replied\r\n\r\n      to his superior officer himself, \u201cwe have ample excuse to offer you and\r\n\r\n      the general. It is necessary that we make an admission, and the general\r\n\r\n      will pardon us, I am sure. Boris and I, during the promenade, happened to\r\n\r\n      quarrel. That quarrel was in full swing when we reached here and we were\r\n\r\n      discussing the way to end it most promptly when monsieur le marechal\r\n\r\n      entered the garden. We must make that our excuse for giving divided\r\n\r\n      attention to what he had to say. As soon as he was gone we had only one\r\n\r\n      thought, to get away from here to settle our difference with arms in our\r\n\r\n      hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWithout speaking to me about it!\u201d interrupted Trehassof. \u201cI never will\r\n\r\n      pardon that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou fight at such a time, when the general is threatened! It is as though\r\n\r\n      you fought between yourselves in the face of the enemy. It is treason!\u201d\r\n\r\n       added Matrena.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame,\u201d said Boris, \u201cwe did not fight. Someone pointed out our fault,\r\n\r\n      and I offered my excuses to Michael Nikolaievitch, who generously accepted\r\n\r\n      them. Is that not so, Michael Nikolaievitch?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd who is this that pointed out your fault?\u201d demanded the marshal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBravo, Natacha. Come, embrace me, my daughter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general pressed his daughter effusively to his broad chest.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd I hope you will not have further disputing,\u201d he cried, looking over\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s shoulder.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe promise you that, General,\u201d declared Boris. \u201cOur lives belong to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou did well, my love. Let us all do as well. I have passed an excellent\r\n\r\n      night, messieurs. Real sleep! I have had just one long sleep.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is so,\u201d said Matrena slowly. \u201cThe general had no need of narcotic.\r\n\r\n      He slept like a child and did not touch his potion.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd my leg is almost well.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll the same, it is singular that those grapes should have disappeared,\u201d\r\n\r\n       insisted the marshal, following his fixed idea.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cErmolai,\u201d called Matrena.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The old servant appeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYesterday evening, after these gentlemen had left the house, did you\r\n\r\n      notice a small white box on the garden table?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Barinia.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the servants? Have any of them been sick? The dvornicks? The\r\n\r\n      schwitzar? In the kitchens? No one sick? No? Go and see; then come and\r\n\r\n      tell me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He returned, saying, \u201cNo one sick.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Like the marshal, Matrena Petrovna and Feodor Feodorovitch looked at one\r\n\r\n      another, repeating in French, \u201cNo one sick! That is strange!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille came forward and gave the only explanation that was plausible\u2014for\r\n\r\n      the others.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, General, that is not strange at all. The grapes have been stolen and\r\n\r\n      eaten by some domestic, and if the servant has not been sick it is simply\r\n\r\n      that the grapes monsieur le marechal brought escaped the spraying of the\r\n\r\n      Bordeaux mixture. That is the whole mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe little fellow must be right,\u201d cried the delighted marshal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is always right, this little fellow,\u201d beamed Matrena, as proudly as\r\n\r\n      though she had brought him into the world.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But \u201cthe little fellow,\u201d taking advantage of the greetings as Athanase\r\n\r\n      Georgevitch and Ivan Petrovitch arrived, left the villa, gripping in his\r\n\r\n      pocket the phial which held what is required to make grapes flourish or to\r\n\r\n      kill a general who is in excellent health. When he had gone a few hundred\r\n\r\n      steps toward the bridges one must cross to go into the city, he was\r\n\r\n      overtaken by a panting dvornick, who brought him a letter that had just\r\n\r\n      come by courier. The writing on the envelope was entirely unknown to him.\r\n\r\n      He tore it open and read, in excellent French:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRequest to M. Joseph Rouletabille not to mix in matters that do not\r\n\r\n      concern him. The second warning will be the last.\u201d It was signed: \u201cThe\r\n\r\n      Central Revolutionary Committee.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo, ho!\u201d said Rouletabille, slipping the paper into his pocket, \u201cthat\u2019s\r\n\r\n      the line it takes, is it! Happily I have nothing more to occupy myself\r\n\r\n      with at all. It is Koupriane\u2019s turn now! Now to go to Koupriane\u2019s!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      On this date, Rouletabille\u2019s note-book: \u201cNatacha to her father: \u2018But you,\r\n\r\n      papa, have you had a good night? Did you take your narcotic?\u2019 \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFearful, and (lest I confuse heaven and hell) I have no right to take any\r\n\r\n      further notes.\u201d *\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      VIII. THE LITTLE CHAPEL OF THE GUARDS\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille took a long walk which led him to the Troitsky Bridge, then,\r\n\r\n      re-descending the Naberjnaia, he reached the Winter Palace. He seemed to\r\n\r\n      have chased away all preoccupation, and took a child\u2019s pleasure in the\r\n\r\n      different aspects of the life that characterizes the city of the Great\r\n\r\n      Peter. He stopped before the Winter Palace, walked slowly across the\r\n\r\n      square where the prodigious monolith of the Alexander Column rises from\r\n\r\n      its bronze socket, strolled between the palace and the colonnades, passed\r\n\r\n      under an immense arch: everything seemed Cyclopean to him, and he never\r\n\r\n      had felt so tiny, so insignificant. None the less he was happy in his\r\n\r\n      insignificance, he was satisfied with himself in the presence of these\r\n\r\n      colossal things; everything pleased him this morning. The speed of the\r\n\r\n      isvos, the bickering humor of the osvotchicks, the elegance of the women,\r\n\r\n      the fine presences of the officers and their easy naturalness under their\r\n\r\n      uniforms, so opposed to the wooden posturing of the Berlin military men\r\n\r\n      whom he had noticed at the \u201cTilleuls\u201d and in the Friederichstrasse between\r\n\r\n      two trains. Everything enchanted him\u2014the costume even of the\r\n\r\n      moujiks, vivid blouses, the red shirts over the trousers, the full legs\r\n\r\n      and the boots up to the knees, even the unfortunates who, in spite of the\r\n\r\n      soft atmosphere, were muffled up in sheepskin coats, all impressed him\r\n\r\n      favorably, everything appeared to him original and congenial.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Order reigned in the city. The guards were polite, decorative and superb\r\n\r\n      in bearing. The passers-by in that quarter talked gayly among themselves,\r\n\r\n      often in French, and had manners as civilized as anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n      Where, then, was the Bear of the North? He never had seen bears so well\r\n\r\n      licked. Was it this very city that only yesterday was in revolution? This\r\n\r\n      was certainly the Alexander Park where troops a few weeks before had fired\r\n\r\n      on children who had sought refuge in the trees, like sparrows. Was this\r\n\r\n      the very pavement where the Cossacks had left so many bodies? Finally he\r\n\r\n      saw before him the Nevsky Prospect, where the bullets rained like hail not\r\n\r\n      long since upon a people dressed for festivities and very joyous. Nichevo!\r\n\r\n      Nichevo! All that was so soon forgotten. They forgot yesterday as they\r\n\r\n      forget to-morrow. The Nihilists? Poets, who imagined that a bomb could\r\n\r\n      accomplish anything in that Babylon of the North more important than the\r\n\r\n      noise of its explosion! Look at these people who pass. They have no more\r\n\r\n      thought for the old attack than for those now preparing in the shadow of\r\n\r\n      the \u201ctracktirs.\u201d Happy men, full of serenity in this bright quarter, who\r\n\r\n      move about their affairs and their pleasures in the purest air, the\r\n\r\n      lightest, the most transparent on earth. No, no; no one knows the joy of\r\n\r\n      mere breathing if he has not breathed the air there, the finest in the\r\n\r\n      north of the world, which gives food and drink of beautiful white\r\n\r\n      eau-de-vie and yellow pivo, and strikes the blood and makes one a beast\r\n\r\n      vigorous and joyful and fatalistic, and mocks at the Nihilists and, as\r\n\r\n      well, at the ten thousand eyes of the police staring from under the\r\n\r\n      porches of houses, from under the skulls of dvornicks\u2014all police,\r\n\r\n      the dvornicks; all police, also the joyous concierges with extended hands.\r\n\r\n      Ah, ah, one mocks at it all in such air, provided one has roubles in one\u2019s\r\n\r\n      pockets, plenty of roubles, and that one is not besotted by reading those\r\n\r\n      extraordinary books that preach the happiness of all humanity to students\r\n\r\n      and to poor girl-students too. Ah, ah, seed of the Nihilists, all that!\r\n\r\n      These poor little fellows and poor little girls who have their heads\r\n\r\n      turned by lectures that they cannot digest! That is all the trouble, the\r\n\r\n      digestion. The digestion is needed. Messieurs the commercial travelers for\r\n\r\n      champagne, who talk together importantly in the lobbies of the Grand\r\n\r\n      Morskaia Hotel and who have studied the Russian people even in the most\r\n\r\n      distant cities where champagne is sold, will tell you that over any table\r\n\r\n      of hors-d\u2019oeuvres, and will regulate the whole question of the Revolution\r\n\r\n      between two little glasses of vodka, swallowed properly, quickly, elbow\r\n\r\n      up, at a single draught, in the Russian manner. Simply an affair of\r\n\r\n      digestion, they tell you. Who is the fool that would dare compare a young\r\n\r\n      gentleman who has well digested a bottle of champagne or two, and another\r\n\r\n      young man who has poorly digested the lucubrations of, who shall we say?\u2014the\r\n\r\n      lucubrations of the economists? The economists? The economists! Fools who\r\n\r\n      compete which can make the most violent statements! Those who read them\r\n\r\n      and don\u2019t understand them go off like a bomb! Your health! Nichevo! The\r\n\r\n      world goes round still, doesn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Discussion political, economic, revolutionary, and other in the room where\r\n\r\n      they munch hors-d\u2019oeuvres! You will hear it all as you pass through the\r\n\r\n      hotel to your chamber, young Rouletabille. Get quickly now to the home of\r\n\r\n      Koupriane, if you don\u2019t wish to arrive there at luncheon-time; then you\r\n\r\n      would have to put off these serious affairs until evening.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Department of Police. Massive entrance, heavily guarded, a great\r\n\r\n      lobby, halls with swinging doors, many obsequious schwitzars on the\r\n\r\n      lookout for tips, many poor creatures sitting against the walls on dirty\r\n\r\n      benches, desks and clerks, brilliant boots and epaulets of gay young\r\n\r\n      officers who are telling tales of the Aquarium with great relish.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Rouletabille! Ah, yes. Please be seated. Delighted, M. Koupriane\r\n\r\n      will be very happy to receive you, but just at this moment he is at\r\n\r\n      inspection. Yes, the inspection of the police dormitories in the barracks.\r\n\r\n      We will take you there. His own idea! He doesn\u2019t neglect anything, does\r\n\r\n      he? A great Chief. Have you seen the police-guards\u2019 dormitory? Admirable!\r\n\r\n      The first dormitories of the world. We say that without wishing to offend\r\n\r\n      France. We love France. A great nation! I will take you immediately to M.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane. I shall be delighted.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI also,\u201d said Rouletabille, who put a rouble into the honorable\r\n\r\n      functionary\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPermit me to precede you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Bows and salutes. For two roubles he would have walked obsequiously before\r\n\r\n      him to the end of the world.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThese functionaries are admirable,\u201d thought Rouletabille as he was led to\r\n\r\n      the barracks. He felt he had not paid too much for the services of a\r\n\r\n      personage whose uniform was completely covered with lace. They tramped,\r\n\r\n      they climbed, they descended. Stairways, corridors. Ah, the barracks at\r\n\r\n      last. He seemed to have entered a convent. Beds very white, very narrow,\r\n\r\n      and images of the Virgin and saints everywhere, monastic neatness and the\r\n\r\n      most absolute silence. Suddenly an order sounded in the corridor outside,\r\n\r\n      and the police-guard, who sprang from no one could tell where, stood to\r\n\r\n      attention at the head of their beds. Koupriane and his aide appeared.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane looked at everything closely, spoke to each man in turn, called\r\n\r\n      them by their names, inquired about their needs, and the men stammered\r\n\r\n      replies, not knowing what to answer, reddening like children. Koupriane\r\n\r\n      observed Rouletabille. He dismissed his aide with a gesture. The\r\n\r\n      inspection was over. He drew the young man into a little room just off the\r\n\r\n      dormitory. Rouletabille, frightened, looked about him. He found himself in\r\n\r\n      a chapel. This little chapel completed the effect of the guards\u2019 \r\n\r\n      dormitory. It was all gilded, decorated in marvelous colors, thronged with\r\n\r\n      little ikons that bring happiness, and, naturally, with the portrait of\r\n\r\n      the Tsar, the dear Little Father.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou see,\u201d said Koupriane, smiling at Rouletabille\u2019s amazement, \u201cwe deny\r\n\r\n      them nothing. We give them their saints right here in their quarters.\u201d\r\n\r\n       Closing the door, he drew a chair toward Rouletabille and motioned him to\r\n\r\n      sit down. They sat before the little altar loaded with flowers, with\r\n\r\n      colored paper and winged saints.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe can talk here without being disturbed,\u201d he said. \u201cYonder there is such\r\n\r\n      a crowd of people waiting for me. I\u2019m ready to listen.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cI have come to give you the report of my\r\n\r\n      mission here, and to terminate my connection with it. All that is left for\r\n\r\n      clearing this obscure affair is to arrest the guilty person, with which I\r\n\r\n      have nothing to do. That concerns you. I simply inform you that someone\r\n\r\n      tried to poison the general last night by pouring arsenate of soda into\r\n\r\n      his sleeping-potion, which I bring you in this phial, arsenate which was\r\n\r\n      secured most probably by washing it from grapes brought to General\r\n\r\n      Trebassof by the marshal of the court, and which disappeared without\r\n\r\n      anyone being able to say how.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, ah, a family affair, a plot within the family. I told you so,\u201d\r\n\r\n       murmured Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe affair at least has happened within the family, as you think,\r\n\r\n      although the assassin came from outside. Contrary to what you may be able\r\n\r\n      to believe, he does not live in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen how does he get there?\u201d demanded Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the window of the room overlooking the Neva. He has often come that\r\n\r\n      way. And that is the way he returns also, I am sure. It is there you can\r\n\r\n      take him if you act with prudence.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know he often comes that way?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know the height of the window above the little roadway. To reach it\r\n\r\n      he uses a water-trough, whose iron rings are bent, and also the marks of a\r\n\r\n      grappling-iron that he carries with him and uses to hoist himself to the\r\n\r\n      window are distinctly visible on the ironwork of the little balcony\r\n\r\n      outside. The marks are quite obviously of different dates.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut that window is closed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSomeone opens it for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho, if you please?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no desire to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh, yes. It necessarily is Natacha. I was sure that the Villa des Iles\r\n\r\n      had its viper. I tell you she doesn\u2019t dare leave her nest because she\r\n\r\n      knows she is watched. Not one of her movements outside escapes us! She\r\n\r\n      knows it. She has been warned. The last time she ventured outside alone\r\n\r\n      was to go into the old quarters of Derewnia. What has she to do in such a\r\n\r\n      rotten quarter? I ask you that. And she turned in her tracks without\r\n\r\n      seeing anyone, without knocking at a single door, because she saw that she\r\n\r\n      was followed. She isn\u2019t able to get to see them outside, therefore she has\r\n\r\n      to see them inside.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are only one, and always the same one.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn examination of the marks on the wall and on the pipe doesn\u2019t leave any\r\n\r\n      doubt of it, and it is always the same grappling-iron that is used for the\r\n\r\n      window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe viper!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Koupriane, Mademoiselle Natacha seems to preoccupy you\r\n\r\n      exceedingly. I did not come here to talk about Mademoiselle Natacha. I\r\n\r\n      came to point out to you the route used by the man who comes to do the\r\n\r\n      murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh, yes, it is she who opens the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can\u2019t deny that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe little demon! Why does she take him into her room at night? Do you\r\n\r\n      think perhaps there is some love-affair...?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure of quite the opposite.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI too. Natacha is not a wanton. Natacha has no heart. She has only a\r\n\r\n      brain. And it doesn\u2019t take long for a brain touched by Nihilism to get so\r\n\r\n      it won\u2019t hesitate at anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane reflected a minute, while Rouletabille watched him in silence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave we solely to do with Nihilism?\u201d resumed Koupriane. \u201cEverything you\r\n\r\n      tell me inclines me more and more to my idea: a family affair, purely in\r\n\r\n      the family. You know, don\u2019t you, that upon the general\u2019s death Natacha\r\n\r\n      will be immensely rich?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I know it,\u201d replied Rouletabille, in a voice that sounded singular\r\n\r\n      to the ear of the Chief of Police and which made him raise his head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI? Nothing,\u201d replied the reporter, this time in a firmer tone. \u201cI ought,\r\n\r\n      however, to say this to you: I am sure that we are dealing with\r\n\r\n      Nihilism...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat makes you believe it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Rouletabille handed Koupriane the message he had received that same\r\n\r\n      morning.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, oh,\u201d cried Koupriane. \u201cYou are under watch! Look out.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have nothing to fear; I\u2019m not bothering myself about anything further.\r\n\r\n      Yes, we have an affair of the revolutionaries, but not of the usual kind.\r\n\r\n      The way they are going about it isn\u2019t like one of their young men that the\r\n\r\n      Central Committee arms with a bomb and who is sacrificed in advance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere are the tracks that you have traced?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRight up to the little Krestowsky Villa.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane bounded from his chair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOccupied by Boris. Parbleu! Now we have them. I see it all now. Boris,\r\n\r\n      another cracked brain! And he is engaged. If he plays the part of the\r\n\r\n      Revolutionaries, the affair would work out big for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat villa,\u201d said Rouletabille quietly, \u201cis also occupied by Michael\r\n\r\n      Korosakoff.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is the most loyal, the most reliable soldier of the Tsar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo one is ever sure of anything, my dear Monsieur Koupriane.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, I am sure of a man like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo man is ever sure of any man, my dear Monsieur Koupriane.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am, in every case, for those I employ.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSomething that can serve you in the enterprise you are going to\r\n\r\n      undertake, because I trust you can catch the murderer right in his nest.\r\n\r\n      To do that, I\u2019ll not conceal from you that I think your agents will have\r\n\r\n      to be enormously clever. They will have to watch the datcha des Iles at\r\n\r\n      night, without anyone possibly suspecting it. No more maroon coats with\r\n\r\n      false astrakhan trimmings, eh? But Apaches, Apaches on the wartrail, who\r\n\r\n      blend themselves with the ground, with the trees, with the stones in the\r\n\r\n      roadway. But among those Apaches don\u2019t send that agent of your Secret\r\n\r\n      Service who watched the window while the assassin climbed to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, these climbs that you can read the proofs of on the wall and on the\r\n\r\n      iron forgings of the balcony went on while your agents, night and day,\r\n\r\n      were watching the villa. Have you noticed, monsieur, that it was always\r\n\r\n      the same agent who took the post at night, behind the villa, under the\r\n\r\n      window? General Trebassof\u2019s book in which he kept a statement of the exact\r\n\r\n      disposal of each of your men during the period of siege was most\r\n\r\n      instructive on that point. The other posts changed in turn, but the same\r\n\r\n      agent, when he was among the guard, demanded always that same post, which\r\n\r\n      was not disputed by anybody, since it is no fun to pass the hours of the\r\n\r\n      night behind a wall, in an empty field. The others much preferred to roll\r\n\r\n      away the time watching in the villa or in front of the lodge, where vodka\r\n\r\n      and Crimean wine, kwass and pivo, kirsch and tchi, never ran short. That\r\n\r\n      agent\u2019s name is Touman.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTouman! Impossible! He is one of the best agents from Kiew. He was\r\n\r\n      recommended by Gounsovski.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille chuckled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d grumbled the Chief of Police. \u201cSomeone always laughs when\r\n\r\n      his name is mentioned.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane had turned red. He rose, opened the door, gave a long direction\r\n\r\n      in Russian, and returned to his chair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cgo ahead and tell me all the details of the poison and\r\n\r\n      the grapes the marshal of the court brought. I\u2019m listening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille told him very briefly and without drawing any deductions all\r\n\r\n      that we already know. He ended his account as a man dressed in a maroon\r\n\r\n      coat with false astrakhan was introduced. It was the same man Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      had met in General Trebassof\u2019s drawing-room and who spoke French. Two\r\n\r\n      gendarmes were behind him. The door had been closed. Koupriane turned\r\n\r\n      toward the man in the coat.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTouman,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to talk to you. You are a traitor, and I have\r\n\r\n      proof. You can confess to me, and I will give you a thousand roubles and\r\n\r\n      you can take yourself off to be hanged somewhere else.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The man\u2019s eyes shrank, but he recovered himself quickly. He replied in\r\n\r\n      Russian.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeak French. I order it,\u201d commanded Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI answer, Your Excellency,\u201d said Touman firmly, \u201cthat I don\u2019t know what\r\n\r\n      Your Excellency means.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI mean that you have helped a man get into the Trebassof villa by night\r\n\r\n      when you were on guard under the window of the little sitting-room. You\r\n\r\n      see that there is no use deceiving us any longer. I play with you frankly,\r\n\r\n      good play, good money. The name of that man, and you have a thousand\r\n\r\n      roubles.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am ready to swear on the ikon of...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t perjure yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have always loyally served...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe name of that man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI still don\u2019t know yet what Your Excellency means.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, you understand me,\u201d replied Koupriane, who visibly held in an anger\r\n\r\n      that threatened to break forth any moment. \u201cA man got into the house while\r\n\r\n      you were watching...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI never saw anything. After all, it is possible. There were some very\r\n\r\n      dark nights. I went back and forth.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are not a fool. The name of that man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI assure you, Excellency...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStrip him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But already the two guards had thrown themselves on Touman and had drawn\r\n\r\n      off his coat and shirt. The man was bare to the waist.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you going to do? What are you going to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLeave them alone,\u201d said Koupriane, roughly pushing Rouletabille back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Seizing a whip which hung at the waist of the guards he struck Touman a\r\n\r\n      blow across the shoulders that drew blood. Touman, mad with the outrage\r\n\r\n      and the pain, shouted, \u201cYes, it is true! I brag of it!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane did not restrain his rage. He showered the unhappy man with\r\n\r\n      blows, having thrown Rouletabille to the end of the room when he tried to\r\n\r\n      interfere. And while he proceeded with the punishment the Chief of Police\r\n\r\n      hurled at the agent who had betrayed him an accompaniment of fearful\r\n\r\n      threats, promising him that before he was hanged he should rot in the\r\n\r\n      bottom-most dungeon of Peter and Paul, in the slimy pits lying under the\r\n\r\n      Neva. Touman, between the two guards who held him, and who sometimes\r\n\r\n      received blows on the rebound that were not intended for them, never\r\n\r\n      uttered a complaint. Outside the invectives of Koupriane there was heard\r\n\r\n      only the swish of the cords and the cries of Rouletabille, who continued\r\n\r\n      to protest that it was abominable, and called the Chief of Police a\r\n\r\n      savage. Finally the savage stopped. Gouts of blood had spattered all\r\n\r\n      about.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said Rouletabille, who supported himself against the wall. \u201cI\r\n\r\n      shall complain to the Tsar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are right,\u201d Koupriane replied, \u201cbut I feel relieved now. You can\u2019t\r\n\r\n      imagine the harm this man can have done to us in the weeks he has been\r\n\r\n      here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Touman, across whose shoulders they had thrown his coat and who lay now\r\n\r\n      across a chair, found strength to look up and say:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is true. You can\u2019t do me as much harm as I have done you, whether you\r\n\r\n      think so or not. All the harm that can be done me by you and yours is\r\n\r\n      already accomplished. My name is not Touman, but Matiev. Listen. I had a\r\n\r\n      son that was the light of my eyes. Neither my son nor I had ever been\r\n\r\n      concerned with politics. I was employed in Moscow. My son was a student.\r\n\r\n      During the Red Week we went out, my son and I, to see a little of what was\r\n\r\n      happening over in the Presnia quarter. They said everybody had been killed\r\n\r\n      over there! We passed before the Presnia gate. Soldiers called to us to\r\n\r\n      stop because they wished to search us. We opened our coats. The soldiers\r\n\r\n      saw my son\u2019s student waistcoat and set up a cry. They unbuttoned the vest,\r\n\r\n      drew a note-book out of his pocket and they found a workman\u2019s song in it\r\n\r\n      that had been published in the Signal. The soldiers didn\u2019t know how to\r\n\r\n      read. They believed the paper was a proclamation, and they arrested my\r\n\r\n      son. I demanded to be arrested with him. They pushed me away. I ran to the\r\n\r\n      governor\u2019s house. Trebassof had me thrust away from his door with blows\r\n\r\n      from the butt-ends of his Cossacks\u2019 guns. And, as I persisted, they kept\r\n\r\n      me locked up all that night and the morning of the next day. At noon I was\r\n\r\n      set free. I demanded my son and they replied they didn\u2019t know what I was\r\n\r\n      talking about. But a soldier that I recognized as having arrested my son\r\n\r\n      the evening before pointed out a van that was passing, covered with a\r\n\r\n      tarpaulin and surrounded by Cossacks. \u2018Your son is there,\u2019 he said; \u2018they\r\n\r\n      are taking him to the graves.\u2019 Mad with despair, I ran after the van. It\r\n\r\n      went to the outskirts of Golountrine cemetery. There I saw in the white\r\n\r\n      snow a huge grave, wide, deep. I shall see it to my last minute. Two vans\r\n\r\n      had already stopped near the hole. Each van held thirteen corpses. The\r\n\r\n      vans were dumped into the trench and the soldiers commenced to sort the\r\n\r\n      bodies into rows of six. I watched for my son. At last I recognized him in\r\n\r\n      a body that half hung over the edge of the trench. Horrors of suffering\r\n\r\n      were stamped in the expression of his face. I threw myself beside him. I\r\n\r\n      said that I was his father. They let me embrace him a last time and count\r\n\r\n      his wounds. He had fourteen. Someone had stolen the gold chain that had\r\n\r\n      hung about his neck and held the picture of his mother, who died the year\r\n\r\n      before. I whispered into his ear, I swore to avenge him. Forty-eight hours\r\n\r\n      later I had placed myself at the disposition of the Revolutionary\r\n\r\n      Committee. A week had not passed before Touman, whom, it seems, I resemble\r\n\r\n      and who was one of the Secret Service agents in Kiew, was assassinated in\r\n\r\n      the train that was taking him to St. Petersburg. The assassination was\r\n\r\n      kept a secret. I received all his papers and I took his place with you. I\r\n\r\n      was doomed beforehand and I asked nothing better, so long as I might last\r\n\r\n      until after the execution of Trebassof. Ah, how I longed to kill him with\r\n\r\n      my own hands! But another had already been assigned the duty and my role\r\n\r\n      was to help him. And do you suppose I am going to tell you the name of\r\n\r\n      that other? Never! And if you discover that other, as you have discovered\r\n\r\n      me, another will come, and another, and another, until Trebassof has paid\r\n\r\n      for his crimes. That is all I have to say to you, Koupriane. As for you,\r\n\r\n      my little fellow,\u201d added he, turning to Rouletabille, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give\r\n\r\n      much for your bones. Neither of you will last long. That is my\r\n\r\n      consolation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane had not interrupted the man. He looked at him in silence, sadly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know, my poor man, you will be hanged now?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d growled Rouletabille. \u201cMonsieur Koupriane, I\u2019ll bet you my purse\r\n\r\n      that he will not be hanged.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd why not?\u201d demanded the Chief of rolice, while, upon a sign from him,\r\n\r\n      they took away the false Touman.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause it is I who denounced him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a reason! And what would you like me to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGuard him for me; for me alone, do you understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn exchange for what?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn exchange for the life of General Trebassof, if I must put it that\r\n\r\n      way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh? The life of General Trebassof! You speak as if it belonged to you, as\r\n\r\n      if you could dispose of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille laid his hand on Koupriane\u2019s arm.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s so,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWould you like me to tell you one thing, Monsieur Rouletabille? It is\r\n\r\n      that General Trebassof\u2019s life, after what has just escaped the lips of\r\n\r\n      this Touman, who is not Touman, isn\u2019t worth any more than\u2014than yours\r\n\r\n      if you remain here. Since you are disposed not to do anything more in this\r\n\r\n      affair, take the train, monsieur, take the train, and go.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille walked back and forth, very much worked up; then suddenly he\r\n\r\n      stopped short.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cImpossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is impossible. I cannot; I am not able to go\r\n\r\n      yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood God, Monsieur Koupriane, because I have to interview the President\r\n\r\n      of the Duma yet, and complete my little inquiry into the politics of the\r\n\r\n      cadets.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, indeed!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane looked at him with a sour grin.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you going to do with that man?\u201d demanded Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave him fixed up first.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen take him before the judges.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is to say, to the gallows?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Koupriane, I offer it to you again. Life for life. Give me the\r\n\r\n      life of that poor devil and I promise you General Trebassof\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExplain yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot at all. Do you promise me that you will maintain silence about the\r\n\r\n      case of that man and that you will not touch a hair of his head?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane looked at Rouletabille as he had looked at him during the\r\n\r\n      altercation they had on the edge of the Gulf. He decided the same way this\r\n\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d said he. \u201cYou have my word. The poor devil!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are a brave man, Monsieur Koupriane, but a little quick with the\r\n\r\n      whip...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat would you expect? One\u2019s work teaches that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood morning. No, don\u2019t trouble to show me out. I am compromised enough\r\n\r\n      already,\u201d said Rouletabille, laughing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAu revoir, and good luck! Get to work interviewing the President of the\r\n\r\n      Duma,\u201d added Koupriane knowingly, with a great laugh.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Rouletabille was already gone.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat lad,\u201d said the Chief of Police aloud to himself, \u201chasn\u2019t told me a\r\n\r\n      bit of what he knows.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      IX. ANNOUCHKA\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd now it\u2019s between us two, Natacha,\u201d murmured Rouletabille as soon as\r\n\r\n      he was outside. He hailed the first carriage that passed and gave the\r\n\r\n      address of the datcha des Iles. When he got in he held his head between\r\n\r\n      his hands; his face burned, his jaws were set. But by a prodigious effort\r\n\r\n      of his will he resumed almost instantly his calm, his self-control. As he\r\n\r\n      went back across the Neva, across the bridge where he had felt so elated a\r\n\r\n      little while before, and saw the isles again he sighed heavily. \u201cI thought\r\n\r\n      I had got it all over with, so far as I was concerned, and now I don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      know where it will stop.\u201d His eyes grew dark for a moment with somber\r\n\r\n      thoughts and the vision of the Lady in Black rose before him; then he\r\n\r\n      shook his head, filled his pipe, lighted it, dried a tear that had been\r\n\r\n      caused doubtless by a little smoke in his eye, and stopped\r\n\r\n      sentimentalizing. A quarter of an hour later he gave a true Russian\r\n\r\n      nobleman\u2019s fist-blow in the back to the coachman as an intimation that\r\n\r\n      they had reached the Trebassof villa. A charming picture was before him.\r\n\r\n      They were all lunching gayly in the garden, around the table in the\r\n\r\n      summer-house. He was astonished, however, at not seeing Natacha with them.\r\n\r\n      Boris Mourazoff and Michael Korsakoff were there. Rouletabille did not\r\n\r\n      wish to be seen. He made a sign to Ermolai, who was passing through the\r\n\r\n      garden and who hurried to meet him at the gate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Barinia,\u201d said the reporter, in a low voice and with his finger to\r\n\r\n      his lips to warn the faithful attendant to caution.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      In two minutes Matrena Petrovna joined Rouletabille in the lodge.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, where is Natacha?\u201d he demanded hurriedly as she kissed his hands\r\n\r\n      quite as though she had made an idol of him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe has gone away. Yes, out. Oh, I did not keep her. I did not try to\r\n\r\n      hold her back. Her expression frightened me, you can understand, my little\r\n\r\n      angel. My, you are impatient! What is it about? How do we stand? What have\r\n\r\n      you decided? I am your slave. Command me. Command me. The keys of the\r\n\r\n      villa?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, give me a key to the veranda; you must have several. I must be able\r\n\r\n      to get into the house to-night if it becomes necessary.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She drew a key from her gown, gave it to the young man and said a few\r\n\r\n      words in Russian to Ermolai, to enforce upon him that he must obey the\r\n\r\n      little domovoi-doukh in anything, day or night.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow tell me where Natacha has gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBoris\u2019s parents came to see us a little while ago, to inquire after the\r\n\r\n      general. They have taken Natacha away with them, as they often have done.\r\n\r\n      Natacha went with them readily enough. Little domovoi, listen to me,\r\n\r\n      listen to Matrena Petrovna\u2014Anyone would have said she was expecting\r\n\r\n      it!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen she has gone to lunch at their house?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoubtless, unless they have gone to a cafe. I don\u2019t know. Boris\u2019s father\r\n\r\n      likes to have the family lunch at the Barque when it is fine. Calm\r\n\r\n      yourself, little domovoi. What ails you? Bad news, eh? Any bad news?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no; everything is all right. Quick, the address of Boris\u2019s family.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe house at the corner of La Place St. Isaac and la rue de la Poste.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood. Thank you. Adieu.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He started for the Place St. Isaac, and picked up an interpreter at the\r\n\r\n      Grand Morskaia Hotel on the way. It might be useful to have him. At the\r\n\r\n      Place St. Isaac he learned the Morazoffs and Natacha Trebassof had gone by\r\n\r\n      train for luncheon at Bergalowe, one of the nearby stations in Finland.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is all,\u201d said he, and added apart to himself, \u201cAnd perhaps that is\r\n\r\n      not true.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He paid the coachman and the interpreter, and lunched at the Brasserie de\r\n\r\n      Vienne nearby. He left there a half-hour later, much calmer. He took his\r\n\r\n      way to the Grand Morskaia Hotel, went inside and asked the schwitzar:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan you give me the address of Mademoiselle Annouchka?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe singer of the Krestowsky?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is who I mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe had luncheon here. She has just gone away with the prince.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Without any curiosity as to which prince, Rouletabille cursed his luck and\r\n\r\n      again asked for her address.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, she lives in an apartment just across the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, feeling better, crossed the street, followed by the\r\n\r\n      interpreter that he had engaged. Across the way he learned on the landing\r\n\r\n      of the first floor that Mademoiselle Annouchka was away for the day. He\r\n\r\n      descended, still followed by his interpreter, and recalling how someone\r\n\r\n      had told him that in Russia it was always profitable to be generous, he\r\n\r\n      gave five roubles to the interpreter and asked him for some information\r\n\r\n      about Mademoiselle Annouchka\u2019s life in St. Petersburg. The interpreter\r\n\r\n      whispered:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe arrived a week ago, but has not spent a single night in her apartment\r\n\r\n      over there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He pointed to the house they had just left, and added:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMerely her address for the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cI understand. She sings this evening,\r\n\r\n      doesn\u2019t she?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, it will be a wonderful debut.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, I know. Thanks.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      All these frustrations in the things he had undertaken that day instead of\r\n\r\n      disheartening him plunged him deep into hard thinking. He returned, his\r\n\r\n      hands in his pockets, whistling softly, to the Place St. Isaac, walked\r\n\r\n      around the church, keeping an eye on the house at the corner, investigated\r\n\r\n      the monument, went inside, examined all its details, came out marveling,\r\n\r\n      and finally went once again to the residence of the Mourazoffs, was told\r\n\r\n      that they had not yet returned from the Finland town, then went and shut\r\n\r\n      himself in his room at the hotel, where he smoked a dozen pipes of\r\n\r\n      tobacco. He emerged from his cloud of smoke at dinner-time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At ten that evening he stepped out of his carriage before the Krestowsky.\r\n\r\n      The establishment of Krestowsky, which looms among the Isles much as the\r\n\r\n      Aquarium does, is neither a theater, nor a music-hall, nor a cafe-concert,\r\n\r\n      nor a restaurant, nor a public garden; it is all of these and some other\r\n\r\n      things besides. Summer theater, winter theater, open-air theater, hall for\r\n\r\n      spectacles, scenic mountain, exercise-ground, diversions of all sorts,\r\n\r\n      garden promenades, cafes, restaurants, private dining-rooms, everything is\r\n\r\n      combined here that can amuse, charm, lead to the wildest orgies, or\r\n\r\n      provide those who never think of sleep till toward three or four o\u2019clock\r\n\r\n      of a morning the means to await the dawn with patience. The most\r\n\r\n      celebrated companies of the old and the new world play there amid an\r\n\r\n      enthusiasm that is steadily maintained by the foresight of the managers:\r\n\r\n      Russian and foreign dancers, and above all the French chanteuses, the\r\n\r\n      little dolls of the cafes-concerts, so long as they are young, bright, and\r\n\r\n      elegantly dressed, may meet their fortune there. If there is no such luck,\r\n\r\n      they are sure at least to find every evening some old beau, and often some\r\n\r\n      officer, who willingly pays twenty-five roubles for the sole pleasure of\r\n\r\n      having a demoiselle born on the banks of the Seine for his companion at\r\n\r\n      the supper-table. After their turn at the singing, these women display\r\n\r\n      their graces and their eager smiles in the promenades of the garden or\r\n\r\n      among the tables where the champagne-drinkers sit. The head-liners,\r\n\r\n      naturally, are not driven to this wearying perambulation, but can go away\r\n\r\n      to their rest if they are so inclined. However, the management is\r\n\r\n      appreciative if they accept the invitation of some dignitary of the army,\r\n\r\n      of administration, or of finance, who seeks the honor of hearing from the\r\n\r\n      chanteuse, in a private room and with a company of friends not disposed to\r\n\r\n      melancholy, the Bohemian songs of the Vieux Derevnia. They sing, they\r\n\r\n      loll, they talk of Paris, and above all they drink. If sometimes the\r\n\r\n      little fete ends rather roughly, it is the friendly and affectionate\r\n\r\n      champagne that is to blame, but usually the orgies remain quite innocent,\r\n\r\n      of a character that certainly might trouble the temperance societies but\r\n\r\n      need not make M. le Senateur Berenger feel involved.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      A war whose powder fumes reeked still, a revolution whose last defeated\r\n\r\n      growls had not died away at the period of these events, had not at all\r\n\r\n      diminished the nightly gayeties of Kretowsky. Many of the young men who\r\n\r\n      displayed their uniforms that evening and called their \u201cNichevo\u201d along the\r\n\r\n      brilliantly lighted paths of the public gardens, or filled the open-air\r\n\r\n      tables, or drank vodka at the buffets, or admired the figures of the\r\n\r\n      wandering soubrettes, had come here on the eve of their departure for the\r\n\r\n      war and had returned with the same child-like, enchanted smile, the same\r\n\r\n      ideal of futile joy, and kissed their passing comrades as gayly as ever.\r\n\r\n      Some of them had a sleeve lying limp now, or walked with a crutch, or even\r\n\r\n      on a wooden leg, but it was, all the same, \u201cNichevo!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The crowd this evening was denser than ordinarily, because there was the\r\n\r\n      chance to hear Annouchka again for the first time since the somber days of\r\n\r\n      Moscow. The students were ready to give her an ovation, and no one opposed\r\n\r\n      it, because, after all, if she sang now it was because the police were\r\n\r\n      willing at last. If the Tsar\u2019s government had granted her her life, it was\r\n\r\n      not in order to compel her to die of hunger. Each earned a livelihood as\r\n\r\n      was possible. Annouchka only knew how to sing and dance, and so she must\r\n\r\n      sing and dance!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When Rouletabille entered the Krestowsky Gardens, Annouchka had commenced\r\n\r\n      her number, which ended with a tremendous \u201cRoussalka.\u201d Surrounded by a\r\n\r\n      chorus of male and female dancers in the national dress and with red\r\n\r\n      boots, striking tambourines with their fingers, then suddenly taking a\r\n\r\n      rigid pose to let the young woman\u2019s voice, which was of rather ordinary\r\n\r\n      register, come out, Annouchka had centered the attention of the immense\r\n\r\n      audience upon herself. All the other parts of the establishment were\r\n\r\n      deserted, the tables had been removed, and a panting crowd pressed about\r\n\r\n      the open-air theater. Rouletabille stood up on his chair at the moment\r\n\r\n      tumultuous \u201cBravos\u201d sounded from a group of students. Annouchka bowed\r\n\r\n      toward them, seeming to ignore the rest of the audience, which had not\r\n\r\n      dared declare itself yet. She sang the old peasant songs arranged to\r\n\r\n      present-day taste, and interspersed them with dances. They had an enormous\r\n\r\n      success, because she gave her whole soul to them and sang with her voice\r\n\r\n      sometimes caressing, sometimes menacing, and sometimes magnificently\r\n\r\n      desperate, giving much significance to words which on paper had not\r\n\r\n      aroused the suspicions of the censor. The taste of the day was obviously\r\n\r\n      still a taste for the revolution, which retained its influence on the\r\n\r\n      banks of the Neva. What she was doing was certainly very bold, and\r\n\r\n      apparently she realized how audacious she was, because, with great\r\n\r\n      adroitness, she would bring out immediately after some dangerous phrase a\r\n\r\n      patriotic couplet which everybody was anxious to applaud. She succeeded by\r\n\r\n      such means in appealing to all the divergent groups of her audience and\r\n\r\n      secured a complete triumph for herself. The students, the revolutionaries,\r\n\r\n      the radicals and the cadets acclaimed the singer, glorifying not only her\r\n\r\n      art but also and beyond everything else the sister of the engineer\r\n\r\n      Volkousky, who had been doomed to perish with her brother by the bullets\r\n\r\n      of the Semenovsky regiment. The friends of the Court on their side could\r\n\r\n      not forget that it was she who, in front of the Kremlin, had struck aside\r\n\r\n      the arm of Constantin Kochkarof, ordered by the Central Revolutionary\r\n\r\n      Committee to assassinate the Grand Duke Peter Alexandrovitch as he drove\r\n\r\n      up to the governor\u2019s house in his sleigh. The bomb burst ten feet away,\r\n\r\n      killing Constantin Kochkarof himself. It may be that before death came he\r\n\r\n      had time to hear Annouchka cry to him, \u201cWretch! You were told to kill the\r\n\r\n      prince, not to assassinate his children.\u201d As it happened, Peter\r\n\r\n      Alexandrovitch held on his knees the two little princesses, seven and\r\n\r\n      eight years old. The Court had wished to recompense her for that heroic\r\n\r\n      act. Annouchka had spit at the envoy of the Chief of Police who called to\r\n\r\n      speak to her of money. At the Hermitage in Moscow, where she sang then,\r\n\r\n      some of her admirers had warned her of possible reprisals on the part of\r\n\r\n      the revolutionaries. But the revolutionaries gave her assurance at once\r\n\r\n      that she had nothing to fear. They approved her act and let her know that\r\n\r\n      they now counted on her to kill the Grand Duke some time when he was\r\n\r\n      alone; which had made Annouchka laugh. She was an enfant terrible, whose\r\n\r\n      friends no one knew, who passed for very wise, and whose lines of intrigue\r\n\r\n      were inscrutable. She enjoyed making her hosts in the private supper-rooms\r\n\r\n      quake over their meal. One day she had said bluntly to one of the most\r\n\r\n      powerful tchinovnicks of Moscow: \u201cYou, my old friend, you are president of\r\n\r\n      the Black Hundred. Your fate is sealed. Yesterday you were condemned to\r\n\r\n      death by the delegates of the Central Committee at Presnia. Say your\r\n\r\n      prayers.\u201d The man reached for champagne. He never finished his glass. The\r\n\r\n      dvornicks carried him out stricken with apoplexy. Since the time she saved\r\n\r\n      the little grand-duchesses the police had orders to allow her to act and\r\n\r\n      talk as she pleased. She had been mixed up in the deepest plots against\r\n\r\n      the government. Those who lent the slightest countenance to such plottings\r\n\r\n      and were not of the police simply disappeared. Their friends dared not\r\n\r\n      even ask for news of them. The only thing not in doubt about them was that\r\n\r\n      they were at hard labor somewhere in the mines of the Ural Mountains. At\r\n\r\n      the moment of the revolution Annouchka had a brother who was an engineer\r\n\r\n      on the Kasan-Moscow line. This Volkousky was one of the leaders on the\r\n\r\n      Strike Committee. The authorities had an eye on him. The revolution\r\n\r\n      started. He, with the help of his sister, accomplished one of those\r\n\r\n      formidable acts which will carry their memory as heroes to the farthest\r\n\r\n      posterity. Their work accomplished, they were taken by Trebassof\u2019s\r\n\r\n      soldiers. Both were condemned to death. Volkousky was executed first, and\r\n\r\n      the sister was taking her turn when an officer of the government arrived\r\n\r\n      on horseback to stop the firing. The Tsar, informed of her intended fate,\r\n\r\n      had sent a pardon by telegraph. After that she disappeared. She was\r\n\r\n      supposed to have gone on some tour across Europe, as was her habit, for\r\n\r\n      she spoke all the languages, like a true Bohemian. Now she had reappeared\r\n\r\n      in all her joyous glory at Krestowsky. It was certain, however, that she\r\n\r\n      had not forgotten her brother. Gossips said that if the government and the\r\n\r\n      police showed themselves so long-enduring they found it to their interest\r\n\r\n      to do so. The open, apparent life Annouchka led was less troublesome to\r\n\r\n      them than her hidden activities would be. The lesser police who surrounded\r\n\r\n      the Chief of the St. Petersburg Secret Service, the famous Gounsovski, had\r\n\r\n      meaning smiles when the matter was discussed. Among them Annouchka had the\r\n\r\n      ignoble nickname, \u201cStool-pigeon.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille must have been well aware of all these particulars concerning\r\n\r\n      Annouchka, for he betrayed no astonishment at the great interest and the\r\n\r\n      strong emotion she aroused. From the corner where he was he could see only\r\n\r\n      a bit of the stage, and he was standing on tiptoes to see the singer when\r\n\r\n      he felt his coat pulled. He turned. It was the jolly advocate, well known\r\n\r\n      for his gastronomic feats, Athanase Georgevitch, along with the jolly\r\n\r\n      Imperial councilor, Ivan Petrovitch, who motioned him to climb down.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome with us; we have a box.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille did not need urging, and he was soon installed in the front\r\n\r\n      of a box where he could see the stage and the public both. Just then the\r\n\r\n      curtain fell on the first part of Annouchka\u2019s performance. The friends\r\n\r\n      were soon rejoined by Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff, the great timber-merchant,\r\n\r\n      who came from behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have been to see the beautiful Onoto,\u201d announced the Lithuanian with a\r\n\r\n      great satisfied laugh. \u201cTell me the news. All the girls are sulking over\r\n\r\n      Annouchka\u2019s success.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho dragged you into the Onoto\u2019s dressing-room then?\" demanded Athanase.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, Gounsovski himself, my dear. He is very amateurish, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! do you knock around with Gounsovski?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn my word, I tell you, dear friends, he isn\u2019t a bad acquaintance. He did\r\n\r\n      me a little service at Bakou last year. A good acquaintance in these times\r\n\r\n      of public trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are in the oil business now, are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, yes, a little of everything for a livelihood. I have a little well\r\n\r\n      down Bakou way, nothing big; and a little house, a very small one for my\r\n\r\n      small business.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a monopolist Thaddeus is,\u201d declared Athanase Georgevitch, hitting\r\n\r\n      him a formidable slap on the thigh with his enormous hand. \u201cGounsovski has\r\n\r\n      come himself to keep an eye on Annouchka\u2019s debut, eh? Only he goes into\r\n\r\n      Onoto\u2019s dressing-room, the rogue.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, he doesn\u2019t trouble himself. Do you know who he is to have supper\r\n\r\n      with? With Annouchka, my dears, and we are invited.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d inquired the jovial councilor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems Gounsovski influenced the minister to permit Annouchka\u2019s\r\n\r\n      performance by declaring he would be responsible for it all. He required\r\n\r\n      from Annouchka solely that she have supper with him on the evening of her\r\n\r\n      debut.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd Annouchka consented?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat was the condition, it seems. For that matter, they say that\r\n\r\n      Annouchka and Gounsovski don\u2019t get along so badly together. Gounsovski has\r\n\r\n      done Annouchka many a good turn. They say he is in love with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe has the air of an umbrella merchant,\u201d snorted Athanase Georgevitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you seen him at close range?\u201d inquired Ivan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have dined at his house, though it is nothing to boast of, on my word.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is what he said,\u201d replied Thaddeus. \u201cWhen he knew we were here\r\n\r\n      together, he said to me: \u2018Bring him, he is a charming fellow who plies a\r\n\r\n      great fork; and bring that dear man Ivan Petrovitch, and all your\r\n\r\n      friends.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, I only dined at his house,\u201d grumbled Athanase, \u201cbecause there was a\r\n\r\n      favor he was going to do me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe does services for everybody, that man,\u201d observed Ivan Petrovitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf course, of course; he ought to,\u201d retorted Athanase. \u201cWhat is a chief\r\n\r\n      of Secret Service for if not to do things for everybody? For everybody, my\r\n\r\n      dear friends, and a little for himself besides. A chief of Secret Service\r\n\r\n      has to be in with everybody, with everybody and his father, as La Fontaine\r\n\r\n      says (if you know that author), if he wants to hold his place. You know\r\n\r\n      what I mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Athanase laughed loudly, glad of the chance to show how French he could be\r\n\r\n      in his allusions, and looked at Rouletabille to see if he had been able to\r\n\r\n      catch the tone of the conversation; but Rouletabille was too much occupied\r\n\r\n      in watching a profile wrapped in a mantilla of black lace, in the Spanish\r\n\r\n      fashion, to repay Athanase\u2019s performance with a knowing smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou certainly have naive notions. You think a chief of Secret Police\r\n\r\n      should be an ogre,\u201d replied the advocate as he nodded here and there to\r\n\r\n      his friends.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, certainly not. He needs to be a sheep in a place like that, a\r\n\r\n      thorough sheep. Gounsovski is soft as a sheep. The time I dined with him\r\n\r\n      he had mutton streaked with fat. He is just like that. I am sure he is\r\n\r\n      mainly layers of fat. When you shake hands you feel as though you had\r\n\r\n      grabbed a piece of fat. My word! And when he eats he wags his jaw\r\n\r\n      fattishly. His head is like that, too; bald, you know, with a cranium like\r\n\r\n      fresh lard. He speaks softly and looks at you like a kid looking to its\r\n\r\n      mother for a juicy meal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut\u2014why\u2014it is Natacha!\u201d murmured the lips of the young man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly it is Natacha, Natacha herself,\u201d exclaimed Ivan Petrovitch, who\r\n\r\n      had used his glasses the better to see whom the young French journalist\r\n\r\n      was looking at. \u201cAh, the dear child! she has wanted to see Annouchka for a\r\n\r\n      long time.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat, Natacha! So it is. So it is. Natacha! Natacha!\u201d said the others.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd with Boris Mourazoff\u2019s parents.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut Boris is not there,\u201d sniggered Thaddeus Tehitchnikoff.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, he can\u2019t be far away. If he was there we would see Michael Korsakoff\r\n\r\n      too. They keep close on each other\u2019s heels.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow has she happened to leave the general? She said she couldn\u2019t bear to\r\n\r\n      be away from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcept to see Annouchka,\u201d replied Ivan. \u201cShe wanted to see her, and\r\n\r\n      talked so about it when I was there that even Feodor Feodorovitch was\r\n\r\n      rather scandalized at her and Matrena Petrovna reproved her downright\r\n\r\n      rudely. But what a girl wishes the gods bring about. That\u2019s the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s so, I know,\u201d put in Athanase. \u201cIvan Petrovitch is right. Natacha\r\n\r\n      hasn\u2019t been able to hold herself in since she read that Annouchka was\r\n\r\n      going to make her debut at Krestowsky. She said she wasn\u2019t going to die\r\n\r\n      without having seen the great artist.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHer father had almost drawn her away from that crowd,\u201d affirmed Ivan,\r\n\r\n      \u201cand that was as it should be. She must have fixed up this affair with\r\n\r\n      Boris and his parents.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Feodor certainly isn\u2019t aware that his daughter\u2019s idea was to applaud\r\n\r\n      the heroine of Kasan station. She is certainly made of stern stuff, my\r\n\r\n      word,\u201d said Athanase.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha, you must remember, is a student,\u201d said Thaddeus, shaking his\r\n\r\n      head; \u201ca true student. They have misfortunes like that now in so many\r\n\r\n      families. I recall, apropos of what Ivan said just now, how today she\r\n\r\n      asked Michael Korsakoff, before me, to let her know where Annouchka would\r\n\r\n      sing. More yet, she said she wished to speak to that artist if it were\r\n\r\n      possible. Michael frowned on that idea, even before me. But Michael\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t refuse her, any more than the others. He can reach Annouchka\r\n\r\n      easier than anyone else. You remember it was he who rode hard and arrived\r\n\r\n      in time with the pardon for that beautiful witch; she ought not to forget\r\n\r\n      him if she cared for her life.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnyone who knows Michael Nikolaievitch knows that he did his duty\r\n\r\n      promptly,\u201d announced Athanase Georgevitch crisply. \u201cBut he would not have\r\n\r\n      gone a step further to save Annouchka. Even now he won\u2019t compromise his\r\n\r\n      career by being seen at the home of a woman who is never from under the\r\n\r\n      eyes of Gounsovski\u2019s agents and who hasn\u2019t been nicknamed \u2018Stool-pigeon\u2019 \r\n\r\n      for nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen why do we go to supper tonight with Annouchka?\u201d asked Ivan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing. We are invited by Gounsovski himself. Don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      forget that, if stories concerning it drift about some day, my friends,\u201d\r\n\r\n       said Thaddeus.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor that matter, Thaddeus, I accept the invitation of the honorable chief\r\n\r\n      of our admirable Secret Service because I don\u2019t wish to slight him. I have\r\n\r\n      dined at his house already. By sitting opposite him at a public table here\r\n\r\n      I feel that I return that politeness. What do you say to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince you have dined with him, tell us what kind of a man he is aside\r\n\r\n      from his fattish qualities,\u201d said the curious councilor. \u201cSo many things\r\n\r\n      are said about him. He certainly seems to be a man it is better to stand\r\n\r\n      in with than to fall out with, so I accept his invitation. How could you\r\n\r\n      manage to refuse it, anyway?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen he first offered me hospitality,\u201d explained the advocate, \u201cI didn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      even know him. I never had been near him. One day a police agent came and\r\n\r\n      invited me to dinner by command\u2014or, at least, I understood it wasn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      wise to refuse the invitation, as you said, Ivan Petrovitch. When I went\r\n\r\n      to his house I thought I was entering a fortress, and inside I thought it\r\n\r\n      must be an umbrella shop. There were umbrellas everywhere, and goloshes.\r\n\r\n      True, it was a day of pouring rain. I was struck by there being no guard\r\n\r\n      with a big revolver in the antechamber. He had a little, timid schwitzar\r\n\r\n      there, who took my umbrella, murmuring \u2018barine\u2019 and bowing over and over\r\n\r\n      again. He conducted me through very ordinary rooms quite unguarded to an\r\n\r\n      average sitting-room of a common kind. We dined with Madame Gounsovski,\r\n\r\n      who appeared fattish like her husband, and three or four men whom I had\r\n\r\n      never seen anywhere. One servant waited on us. My word!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt dessert Gounsovski took me aside and told me I was unwise to \u2018argue\r\n\r\n      that way.\u2019 I asked him what he meant by that. He took my hands between his\r\n\r\n      fat hands and repeated, \u2018No, no, it is not wise to argue like that.\u2019 I\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t draw anything else out of him. For that matter, I understood him,\r\n\r\n      and, you know, since that day I have cut out certain side passages\r\n\r\n      unnecessary in my general law pleadings that had been giving me a\r\n\r\n      reputation for rather too free opinions in the papers. None of that at my\r\n\r\n      age! Ah, the great Gounsovski! Over our coffee I asked him if he didn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      find the country in pretty strenuous times. He replied that he looked\r\n\r\n      forward with impatience to the month of May, when he could go for a rest\r\n\r\n      to a little property with a small garden that he had bought at Asnieres,\r\n\r\n      near Paris. When he spoke of their house in the country Madame Gounsovski\r\n\r\n      heaved a sigh of longing for those simple country joys. The month of May\r\n\r\n      brought tears to her eyes. Husband and wife looked at one another with\r\n\r\n      real tenderness. They had not the air of thinking for one second:\r\n\r\n      to-morrow or the day after, before our country happiness comes, we may\r\n\r\n      find ourselves stripped of everything. No! They were sure of their happy\r\n\r\n      vacation and nothing seemed able to disquiet them under their fat.\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski has done everybody so many services that no one really wishes\r\n\r\n      him ill, poor man. Besides, have you noticed, my dear old friends, that no\r\n\r\n      one ever tries to work harm to chiefs of Secret Police? One goes after\r\n\r\n      heads of police, prefects of police, ministers, grand-dukes, and even\r\n\r\n      higher, but the chiefs of Secret Police are never, never attacked. They\r\n\r\n      can promenade tranquilly in the streets or in the gardens of Krestowsky or\r\n\r\n      breathe the pure air of the Finland country or even the country around\r\n\r\n      Paris. They have done so many little favors for this one and that, here\r\n\r\n      and there, that no one wishes to do them the least injury. Each person\r\n\r\n      always thinks, too, that others have been less well served than he. That\r\n\r\n      is the secret of the thing, my friends, that is the secret. What do you\r\n\r\n      say?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The others said: \u201cAh, ah, the good Gounsovski. He knows. He knows.\r\n\r\n      Certainly, accept his supper. With Annouchka it will be fun.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMessieurs,\u201d asked Rouletabille, who continued to make discoveries in the\r\n\r\n      audience, \u201cdo you know that officer who is seated at the end of a row down\r\n\r\n      there in the orchestra seats? See, he is getting up.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe? Why, that is Prince Galitch, who was one of the richest lords of the\r\n\r\n      North Country. Now he is practically ruined.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThanks, gentlemen; certainly it is he. I know him,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      seating himself and mastering his emotion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey say he is a great admirer of Annouchka,\u201d hazarded Thaddeus. Then he\r\n\r\n      walked away from the box.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe prince has been ruined by women,\u201d said Athanase Georgevitch, who\r\n\r\n      pretended to know the entire chronicle of gallantries in the empire.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe also has been on good terms with Gounsovski,\u201d continued Thaddeus.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe passes at court, though, for an unreliable. He once made a long visit\r\n\r\n      to Tolstoi.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBah! Gounsovski must have rendered some signal service to that imprudent\r\n\r\n      prince,\u201d concluded Athanase. \u201cBut for yourself, Thaddeus, you haven\u2019t said\r\n\r\n      what you did with Gounsovski at Bakou.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      (Rouletabille did not lose a word of what was being said around him,\r\n\r\n      although he never lost sight of the profile hidden in the black mantle nor\r\n\r\n      of Prince Galitch, his personal enemy,* who reappeared, it seemed to him,\r\n\r\n      at a very critical moment.)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was returning from Balakani in a drojki,\u201d said Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff,\r\n\r\n      \u201cand I was drawing near Bakou after having seen the debris of my oil\r\n\r\n      shafts that had been burned by the Tartars, when I met Gounsovski in the\r\n\r\n      road, who, with two of his friends, found themselves badly off with one of\r\n\r\n      the wheels of their carriage broken. I stopped. He explained to me that he\r\n\r\n      had a Tartar coachman, and that this coachman having seen an Armenian on\r\n\r\n      the road before him, could find nothing better to do than run full tilt\r\n\r\n      into the Armenian\u2019s equipage. He had reached over and taken the reins from\r\n\r\n      him, but a wheel of the carriage was broken.\u201d (Rouletabille quivered,\r\n\r\n      because he caught a glance of communication between Prince Galitch and\r\n\r\n      Natacha, who was leaning over the edge of her box.) \u201cSo I offered to take\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski and his friends into my carriage, and we rode all together to\r\n\r\n      Bakou after Gounsovski, who always wishes to do a service, as Athanase\r\n\r\n      Georgevitch says, had warned his Tartar coachman not to finish the\r\n\r\n      Armenian.\u201d (Prince Galitch, at the moment the orchestra commenced the\r\n\r\n      introductory music for Annouchka\u2019s new number, took advantage of all eyes\r\n\r\n      being turned toward the rising curtain to pass near Natacha\u2019s seat. This\r\n\r\n      time he did not look at Natacha, but Rouletabille was sure that his lips\r\n\r\n      had moved as he went by her.)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thaddeus continued: \u201cIt is necessary to explain that at Bakou my little\r\n\r\n      house is one of the first before you reach the quay. I had some Armenian\r\n\r\n      employees there. When arrived, what do you suppose I saw? A file of\r\n\r\n      soldiers with cannon, yes, with a cannon, on my word, turned against my\r\n\r\n      house and an officer saying quietly, \u2018there it is. Fire!\u2019\u201d (Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      made yet another discovery\u2014two, three discoveries. Near by, standing\r\n\r\n      back of Natacha\u2019s seat, was a figure not unknown to the young reporter,\r\n\r\n      and there, in one of the orchestra chairs, were two other men whose faces\r\n\r\n      he had seen that same morning in Koupriane\u2019s barracks. Here was where a\r\n\r\n      memory for faces stood him in good stead. He saw that he was not the only\r\n\r\n      person keeping close watch on Natacha.) \u201cWhen I heard what the officer\r\n\r\n      said,\u201d Thaddeus went on, \u201cI nearly dropped out of the drojki. I hurried to\r\n\r\n      the police commissioner. He explained the affair promptly, and I was quick\r\n\r\n      to understand. During my absence one of my Armenian employees had fired at\r\n\r\n      a Tartar who was passing. For that matter, he had killed him. The governor\r\n\r\n      was informed and had ordered the house to be bombarded, for an example, as\r\n\r\n      had been done with several others. I found Gounsovski and told him the\r\n\r\n      trouble in two words. He said it wasn\u2019t necessary for him to interfere in\r\n\r\n      the affair, that I had only to talk to the officer. \u2018Give him a good\r\n\r\n      present, a hundred roubles, and he will leave your house. I went back to\r\n\r\n      the officer and took him aside; he said he wanted to do anything that he\r\n\r\n      could for me, but that the order was positive to bombard the house. I\r\n\r\n      reported his answer to Gounsovski, who told me: \u2018Tell him then to turn the\r\n\r\n      muzzle of the cannon the other way and bombard the building of the chemist\r\n\r\n      across the way, then he can always say that he mistook which house was\r\n\r\n      intended.\u2019 I did that, and he had them turn the cannon. They bombarded the\r\n\r\n      chemist\u2019s place, and I got out of the whole thing for the hundred roubles.\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski, the good fellow, may be a great lump of fat and be like an\r\n\r\n      umbrella merchant, but I have always been grateful to him from the bottom\r\n\r\n      of my heart, you can understand, Athanase Georgevitch.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat reputation has Prince Galitch at the court?\u201d inquired Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      all at once.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, oh!\u201d laughed the others. \u201cSince he went so openly to visit Tolstoi he\r\n\r\n      doesn\u2019t go to the court any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd\u2014his opinions? What are his opinions?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, the opinions of everybody are so mixed nowadays, nobody knows.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ivan Petrovitch said, \u201cHe passes among some people as very advanced and\r\n\r\n      very much compromised.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYet they don\u2019t bother him?\u201d inquired Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPooh, pooh,\u201d replied the gay Councilor of Empire, \u201cit is rather he who\r\n\r\n      tries to mix with them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thaddeus stooped down and said, \u201cThey say that he can\u2019t be reached because\r\n\r\n      of the hold he has over a certain great personage in the court, and it\r\n\r\n      would be a scandal\u2014a great scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe quiet, Thaddeus,\u201d interrupted Athanase Georgevitch, roughly. \u201cIt is\r\n\r\n      easy to see that you are lately from the provinces to speak so recklessly,\r\n\r\n      but if you go on this way I shall leave.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAthanase Georgevitch is right; hang onto your mouth, Thaddeus,\u201d counseled\r\n\r\n      Ivan Petrovitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The talkers all grew silent, for the curtain was rising. In the audience\r\n\r\n      there were mysterious allusions being made to this second number of\r\n\r\n      Annouchka, but no one seemed able to say what it was to be, and it was, as\r\n\r\n      a matter of fact, very simple. After the whirl-wind of dances and choruses\r\n\r\n      and all the splendor with which she had been accompanied the first time,\r\n\r\n      Annouchka appeared as a poor Russian peasant in a scene representing the\r\n\r\n      barren steppes, and very simply she sank to her knees and recited her\r\n\r\n      evening prayers. Annouchka was singularly beautiful. Her aquiline nose\r\n\r\n      with sensitive nostrils, the clean-cut outline of her eyebrows, her look\r\n\r\n      that now was almost tender, now menacing, always unusual, her pale rounded\r\n\r\n      cheeks and the entire expression of her face showed clearly the strength\r\n\r\n      of new ideas, spontaneity, deep resolution and, above all, passion. The\r\n\r\n      prayer was passionate. She had an admirable contralto voice which affected\r\n\r\n      the audience strangely from its very first notes. She asked God for daily\r\n\r\n      bread for everyone in the immense Russian land, daily bread for the flesh\r\n\r\n      and for the spirit, and she stirred the tears of everyone there, to\r\n\r\n      which-ever party they belonged. And when, as her last note sped across the\r\n\r\n      desolate steppe and she rose and walked toward the miserable hut, frantic\r\n\r\n      bravos from a delirious audience told her the prodigious emotions she had\r\n\r\n      aroused. Little Rouletabille, who, not understanding the words,\r\n\r\n      nevertheless caught the spirit of that prayer, wept. Everybody wept. Ivan\r\n\r\n      Petrovitch, Athanase Georgevitch, Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff were standing up,\r\n\r\n      stamping their feet and clapping their hands like enthusiastic boys. The\r\n\r\n      students, who could be easily distinguished by the uniform green edging\r\n\r\n      they wore on their coats, uttered insensate cries. And suddenly there rose\r\n\r\n      the first strains of the national hymn. There was hesitation at first, a\r\n\r\n      wavering. But not for long. Those who had been dreading some\r\n\r\n      counter-demonstration realized that no objection could possibly be raised\r\n\r\n      to a prayer for the Tsar. All heads uncovered and the Bodje Taara Krari\r\n\r\n      mounted, unanimously, toward the stars.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Through his tears the young reporter never gave up his close watch on\r\n\r\n      Natacha. She had half risen, and, sinking back, leaned on the edge of the\r\n\r\n      box. She called, time and time again, a name that Rouletabille could not\r\n\r\n      hear in the uproar, but that he felt sure was \u201cAnnouchka! Annouchka!\u201d \u201cThe\r\n\r\n      reckless girl,\u201d murmured Rouletabille, and, profiting by the general\r\n\r\n      excitement, he left the box without being noticed. He made his way through\r\n\r\n      the crowd toward Natacha, whom he had sought futilely since morning. The\r\n\r\n      audience, after clamoring in vain for a repetition of the prayer by\r\n\r\n      Annouchka, commenced to disperse, and the reporter was swept along with\r\n\r\n      them for a few moments. When he reached the range of boxes he saw that\r\n\r\n      Natacha and the family she had been with were gone. He looked on all sides\r\n\r\n      without seeing the object of his search and like a madman commenced to run\r\n\r\n      through the passages, when a sudden idea struck his blood cold. He\r\n\r\n      inquired where the exit for the artists was and as soon as it was pointed\r\n\r\n      out, he hurried there. He was not mistaken. In the front line of the crowd\r\n\r\n      that waited to see Annouchka come out he recognized Natacha, with her head\r\n\r\n      enveloped in the black mantle so that none should see her face. Besides,\r\n\r\n      this corner of the garden was in a half-gloom. The police barred the way;\r\n\r\n      he could not approach as near Natacha as he wished. He set himself to slip\r\n\r\n      like a serpent through the crowd. He was not separated from Natacha by\r\n\r\n      more than four or five persons when a great jostling commenced. Annouchka\r\n\r\n      was coming out. Cries rose: \u201cAnnouchka! Annouchka!\u201d Rouletabille threw\r\n\r\n      himself on his knees and on all-fours succeeded in sticking his head\r\n\r\n      through into the way kept by the police for Annouchka\u2019s passage. There,\r\n\r\n      wrapped in a great red mantle, his hat on his arm, was a man Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      immediately recognized. It was Prince Galitch. They were hurrying to\r\n\r\n      escape the impending pressure of the crowd. But Annouchka as she passed\r\n\r\n      near Natacha stopped just a second\u2014a movement that did not escape\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2014and, turning toward her said just the one word,\r\n\r\n      \u201cCaracho.\u201d Then she passed on. Rouletabille got up and forced his way\r\n\r\n      back, having once more lost Natacha. He searched for her. He ran to the\r\n\r\n      carriage-way and arrived just in time to see her seated in a carriage with\r\n\r\n      the Mourazoff family. The carriage started at once in the direction of the\r\n\r\n      datcha des Iles. The young man remained standing there, thinking. He made\r\n\r\n      a gesture as though he were ready now to let luck take its course. \u201cIn the\r\n\r\n      end,\u201d said he, \u201cit will be better so, perhaps,\u201d and then, to himself, \u201cNow\r\n\r\n      to supper, my boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He turned in his tracks and soon was established in the glaring light of\r\n\r\n      the restaurant. Officers standing, glass in hand, were saluting from table\r\n\r\n      to table and waving a thousand compliments with grace that was almost\r\n\r\n      feminine.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He heard his name called joyously, and recognized the voice of Ivan\r\n\r\n      Petrovitch. The three boon companions were seated over a bottle of\r\n\r\n      champagne resting in its ice-bath and were being served with tiny pates\r\n\r\n      while they waited for the supper-hour, which was now near.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille yielded to their invitation readily enough, and accompanied\r\n\r\n      them when the head-waiter informed Thaddeus that the gentlemen were\r\n\r\n      desired in a private room. They went to the first floor and were ushered\r\n\r\n      into a large apartment whose balcony opened on the hall of the\r\n\r\n      winter-theater, empty now. But the apartment was already occupied. Before\r\n\r\n      a table covered with a shining service Gounsovski did the honors.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He received them like a servant, with his head down, an obsequious smile,\r\n\r\n      and his back bent, bowing several times as each of the guests were\r\n\r\n      presented to him. Athanase had described him accurately enough, a mannikin\r\n\r\n      in fat. Under the vast bent brow one could hardly see his eyes, behind the\r\n\r\n      blue glasses that seemed always ready to fall as he inclined too far his\r\n\r\n      fat head with its timid and yet all-powerful glance. When he spoke in his\r\n\r\n      falsetto voice, his chin dropped in a fold over his collar, and he had a\r\n\r\n      steady gesture with the thumb and index finger of his right hand to retain\r\n\r\n      the glasses from sliding down his short, thick nose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Behind him there was the fine, haughty silhouette of Prince Galitch. He\r\n\r\n      had been invited by Annouchka, for she had consented to risk this supper\r\n\r\n      only in company with three or four of her friends, officers who could not\r\n\r\n      be further compromised by this affair, as they were already under the eye\r\n\r\n      of the Okrana (Secret Police) despite their high birth. Gounsovski had\r\n\r\n      seen them come with a sinister chuckle and had lavished upon them his\r\n\r\n      marks of devotion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He loved Annouchka. It would have sufficed to have surprised just once the\r\n\r\n      jealous glance he sent from beneath his great blue glasses when he gazed\r\n\r\n      at the singer to have understood the sentiments that actuated him in the\r\n\r\n      presence of the beautiful daughter of the Black Land.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Annouchka was seated, or, rather, she lounged, Oriental fashion, on the\r\n\r\n      sofa which ran along the wall behind the table. She paid attention to no\r\n\r\n      one. Her attitude was forbidding, even hostile. She indifferently allowed\r\n\r\n      her marvelous black hair that fell in two tresses over her shoulder to be\r\n\r\n      caressed by the perfumed hands of the beautiful Onoto, who had heard her\r\n\r\n      this evening for the first time and had thrown herself with enthusiasm\r\n\r\n      into her arms after the last number. Onoto was an artist too, and the\r\n\r\n      pique she felt at first over Annouchka\u2019s success could not last after the\r\n\r\n      emotion aroused by the evening prayer before the hut. \u201cCome to supper,\u201d\r\n\r\n       Annouchka had said to her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith whom?\u201d inquired the Spanish artist.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith Gounsovski.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo come. You will help me pay my debt and perhaps he will be useful to\r\n\r\n      you as well. He is useful to everybody.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Decidedly Onoto did not understand this country, where the worst enemies\r\n\r\n      supped together.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had been monopolized at once by Prince Galitch, who took him\r\n\r\n      into a corner and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo I inconvenience you?\u201d asked the boy.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The other assumed the amused smile of the great lord.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhile there is still time,\u201d he said, \u201cbelieve me, you ought to start, to\r\n\r\n      quit this country. Haven\u2019t you had sufficient notice?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d replied the reporter. \u201cAnd you can dispense with any further notice\r\n\r\n      from this time on.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He turned his back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, it is the little Frenchman from the Trebassof villa,\u201d commenced the\r\n\r\n      falsetto voice of Gounsovski as he pushed a seat towards the young man and\r\n\r\n      begged him to sit between him and Athanase Georgevitch, who was already\r\n\r\n      busy with the hors-d\u2019oeuvres.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you do, monsieur?\u201d said the beautiful, grave voice of Annouchka.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille saluted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI see that I am in a country of acquaintances,\u201d he said, without\r\n\r\n      appearing disturbed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He addressed a lively compliment to Annouchka, who threw him a kiss.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRouletabille!\u201d cried la belle Onoto. \u201cWhy, then, he is the little fellow\r\n\r\n      who solved the mystery of the Yellow Room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHimself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe came to save the life of General Trebassof,\u201d sniggered Gounsovski. \u201cHe\r\n\r\n      is certainly a brave little young man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe police know everything,\u201d said Rouletabille coldly. And he asked for\r\n\r\n      champagne, which he never drank.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The champagne commenced its work. While Thaddeus and the officers told\r\n\r\n      each other stories of Bakou or paid compliments to the women, Gounsovski,\r\n\r\n      who was through with raillery, leaned toward Rouletabille and gave that\r\n\r\n      young man fatherly counsel with great unction.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have undertaken, young man, a noble task and one all the more\r\n\r\n      difficult because General Trebassof is condemned not only by his enemies\r\n\r\n      but still more by the ignorance of Koupriane. Understand me thoroughly:\r\n\r\n      Koupriane is my friend and a man whom I esteem very highly. He is good,\r\n\r\n      brave as a warrior, but I wouldn\u2019t give a kopeck for his police. He has\r\n\r\n      mixed in our affairs lately by creating his own secret police, but I don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      wish to meddle with that. It amuses us. It\u2019s the new style, anyway;\r\n\r\n      everybody wants his secret police nowadays. And yourself, young man, what,\r\n\r\n      after all, are you doing here? Reporting? No. Police work? That is our\r\n\r\n      business and your business. I wish you good luck, but I don\u2019t expect it.\r\n\r\n      Remember that if you need any help I will give it you willingly. I love to\r\n\r\n      be of service. And I don\u2019t wish any harm to befall you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are very kind, monsieur,\u201d was all Rouletabille replied, and he called\r\n\r\n      again for champagne.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Several times Gounsovski addressed remarks to Annouchka, who concerned\r\n\r\n      herself with her meal and had little answer for him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you know who applauded you the most this evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d said Annouchka indifferently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe daughter of General Trebassof.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, that is true, on my word,\u201d cried Ivan Petrovitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, Natacha was there,\u201d joined in the other friends from the datcha\r\n\r\n      des Iles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor me, I saw her weep,\u201d said Rouletabille, looking at Annouchka fixedly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Annouchka replied in an icy tone:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not know her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is unlucky in having a father...\u201d Prince Galitch commenced.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrince, no politics, or let me take my leave,\u201d clucked Gounsovski. \u201cYour\r\n\r\n      health, dear Annouchka.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour health, Gounsovski. But you have no worry about that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy?\u201d demanded Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff in equivocal fashion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause he is too useful to the government,\u201d cried Ivan Petrovitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied Annouchka; \u201cto the revolutionaries.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      All broke out laughing. Gounsovski recovered his slipping glasses by his\r\n\r\n      usual quick movement and sniggered softly, insinuatingly, like fat boiling\r\n\r\n      in the pot:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo they say. And it is my strength.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis system is excellent,\u201d said the prince. \u201cAs he is in with everybody,\r\n\r\n      everybody is in with the police, without knowing it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey say... ah, ah... they say...\u201d (Athanase was choking over a little\r\n\r\n      piece of toast that he had soaked in his soup) \u201cthey say that he has\r\n\r\n      driven away all the hooligans and even all the beggars of the church of\r\n\r\n      Kasan.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thereupon they commenced to tell stories of the hooligans, street-thieves\r\n\r\n      who since the recent political troubles had infested St. Petersburg and\r\n\r\n      whom nobody, could get rid of without paying for it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Athanase Georgevitch said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are hooligans that ought to have existed even if they never have.\r\n\r\n      One of them stopped a young girl before Varsovie station. The girl,\r\n\r\n      frightened, immediately held out her purse to him, with two roubles and\r\n\r\n      fifty kopecks in it. The hooligan took it all. \u2018Goodness,\u2019 cried she, \u2018I\r\n\r\n      have nothing now to take my train with.\u2019 \u2018How much is it?\u2019 asked the\r\n\r\n      hooligan. \u2018Sixty kopecks.\u2019 \u2018Sixty kopecks! Why didn\u2019t you say so?\u2019 And the\r\n\r\n      bandit, hanging onto the two roubles, returned the fifty-kopeck piece to\r\n\r\n      the trembling child and added a ten-kopeck piece out of his own pocket.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSomething quite as funny happened to me two winters ago, at Moscow,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      la belle Onoto. \u201cI had just stepped out of the door when I was stopped by\r\n\r\n      a hooligan. \u2018Give me twenty kopecks,\u2019 said the hooligan. I was so\r\n\r\n      frightened that I couldn\u2019t get my purse open. \u2018Quicker,\u2019 said he. Finally\r\n\r\n      I gave him twenty kopecks. \u2018Now,\u2019 said he then, \u2018kiss my hand.\u2019 And I had\r\n\r\n      to kiss it, because he held his knife in the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, they are quick with their knives,\u201d said Thaddeus. \u201cAs I was leaving\r\n\r\n      Gastinidvor once I was stopped by a hooligan who stuck a huge\r\n\r\n      carving-knife under my nose. \u2018You can have it for a rouble and a half,\u2019 he\r\n\r\n      said. You can believe that I bought it without any haggling. And it was a\r\n\r\n      very good bargain. It was worth at least three roubles. Your health, belle\r\n\r\n      Onoto.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI always take my revolver when I go out,\u201d said Athanase. \u201cIt is more\r\n\r\n      prudent. I say this before the police. But I would rather be arrested by\r\n\r\n      the police than stabbed by the hooligans.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s no place any more to buy revolvers,\u201d declared Ivan Petrovitch.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll such places are closed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski settled his glasses, rubbed his fat hands and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are some still at my locksmith\u2019s place. The proof is that to-day in\r\n\r\n      the little Kaniouche my locksmith, whose name is Smith, went into the\r\n\r\n      house of the grocer at the corner and wished to sell him a revolver. It\r\n\r\n      was a Browning. \u2018An arm of the greatest reliability,\u2019 he said to him,\r\n\r\n      \u2018which never misses fire and which works very easily.\u2019 Having pronounced\r\n\r\n      these words, the locksmith tried his revolver and lodged a ball in the\r\n\r\n      grocer\u2019s lung. The grocer is dead, but before he died he bought the\r\n\r\n      revolver. \u2018You are right,\u2019 he said to the locksmith; \u2018it is a terrible\r\n\r\n      weapon.\u2019 And then he died.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The others laughed heartily. They thought it very funny. Decidedly this\r\n\r\n      great Gounsovski always had a funny story. Who would not like to be his\r\n\r\n      friend? Annouchka had deigned to smile. Gounsovski, in recognition,\r\n\r\n      extended his hand to her like a mendicant. The young woman touched it with\r\n\r\n      the end of her fingers, as if she were placing a twenty-kopeck piece in\r\n\r\n      the hand of a hooligan, and withdrew from it with disgust. Then the doors\r\n\r\n      opened for the Bohemians. Their swarthy troupe soon filled the room. Every\r\n\r\n      evening men and women in their native costumes came from old Derevnia,\r\n\r\n      where they lived all together in a sort of ancient patriarchal community,\r\n\r\n      with customs that had not changed for centuries; they scattered about in\r\n\r\n      the places of pleasure, in the fashionable restaurants, where they\r\n\r\n      gathered large sums, for it was a fashionable luxury to have them sing at\r\n\r\n      the end of suppers, and everyone showered money on them in order not to be\r\n\r\n      behind the others. They accompanied on guzlas, on castanets, on\r\n\r\n      tambourines, and sang the old airs, doleful and languorous, or excitable\r\n\r\n      and breathless as the flight of the earliest nomads in the beginnings of\r\n\r\n      the world.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When they had entered, those present made place for them, and\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, who for some moments had been showing marks of fatigue and\r\n\r\n      of a giddiness natural enough in a young man who isn\u2019t in the habit of\r\n\r\n      drinking the finest champagnes, profited by the diversion to get a corner\r\n\r\n      of the sofa not far from Prince Galitch, who occupied the place at\r\n\r\n      Annouchka\u2019s right.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook, Rouletabaille is asleep,\u201d remarked la belle Onoto.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPoor boy!\u201d said Annouchka.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And, turning toward Gounsovski:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAren\u2019t you soon going to get him out of our way? I heard some of our\r\n\r\n      brethren the other day speaking in a way that would cause pain to those\r\n\r\n      who care about his health.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, that,\u201d said Gounsovski, shaking his head, \u201cis an affair I have\r\n\r\n      nothing to do with. Apply to Koupriane. Your health, belle Annouchka.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the Bohemians swept some opening chords for their songs, and the\r\n\r\n      singers took everybody\u2019s attention, everybody excepting Prince Galitch and\r\n\r\n      Annouchka, who, half turned toward one another, exchanged some words on\r\n\r\n      the edge of all this musical uproar. As for Rouletabille, he certainly\r\n\r\n      must have been sleeping soundly not to have been waked by all that noise,\r\n\r\n      melodious as it was. It is true that he had\u2014apparently\u2014drunk a\r\n\r\n      good deal and, as everyone knows, in Russia drink lays out those who can\u2019t\r\n\r\n      stand it. When the Bohemians had sung three times Gounsovski made a sign\r\n\r\n      that they might go to charm other ears, and slipped into the hands of the\r\n\r\n      chief of the band a twenty-five rouble note. But Onoto wished to give her\r\n\r\n      mite, and a regular collection commenced. Each one threw roubles into the\r\n\r\n      plate held out by a little swarthy Bohemian girl with crow-black hair,\r\n\r\n      carelessly combed, falling over her forehead, her eyes and her face, in so\r\n\r\n      droll a fashion that one would have said the little thing was a\r\n\r\n      weeping-willow soaked in ink. The plate reached Prince Galitch, who\r\n\r\n      futilely searched his pockets.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBah!\u201d said he, with a lordly air, \u201cI have no money. But here is my\r\n\r\n      pocket-book; I will give it to you for a souvenir of me, Katharina.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thaddeus and Athanase exclaimed at the generosity of the prince, but\r\n\r\n      Annouchka said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe prince does as he should, for my friends can never sufficiently repay\r\n\r\n      the hospitality that that little thing gave me in her dirty hut when I was\r\n\r\n      in hiding, while your famous department was deciding what to do about me,\r\n\r\n      my dear Gounsovski.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh,\u201d replied Gounsovski, \u201cI let you know that all you had to do was to\r\n\r\n      take a fine apartment in the city.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Annouchka spat on the ground like a teamster, and Gounsovski from yellow\r\n\r\n      turned green.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut why did you hide yourself that way, Annouchka?\u201d asked Onoto as she\r\n\r\n      caressed the beautiful tresses of the singer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know I had been condemned to death, and then pardoned. I had been\r\n\r\n      able to leave Moscow, and I hadn\u2019t any desire to be re-taken here and sent\r\n\r\n      to taste the joys of Siberia.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut why were you condemned to death?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, she doesn\u2019t know anything!\u201d exclaimed the others.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood Lord, I\u2019m just back from London and Paris\u2014how should I know\r\n\r\n      anything! But to have been condemned to death! That must have been\r\n\r\n      amusing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery amusing,\u201d said Annouchka icily. \u201cAnd if you have a brother whom you\r\n\r\n      love, Onoto, think how much more amusing it must be to have him shot\r\n\r\n      before you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, my love, forgive me!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo you may know and not give any pain to your Annouchka in the future, I\r\n\r\n      will tell you, madame, what happened to our dear friend,\u201d said Prince\r\n\r\n      Galitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe would do better to drive away such terrible memories,\u201d ventured\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski, lifting his eyelashes behind his glasses, but he bent his head\r\n\r\n      as Annouchka sent him a blazing glance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeak, Galitch.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Prince did as she said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnnouchka had a brother, Vlassof, an engineer on the Kasan line, whom the\r\n\r\n      Strike Committee had ordered to take out a train as the only means of\r\n\r\n      escape for the leaders of the revolutionary troops when Trebassof\u2019s\r\n\r\n      soldiers, aided by the Semenowsky regiment, had become masters of the\r\n\r\n      city. The last resistance took place at the station. It was necessary to\r\n\r\n      get started. All the ways were guarded by the military. There were\r\n\r\n      soldiers everywhere! Vlassof said to his comrades, \u2018I will save you;\u2019 and\r\n\r\n      his comrades saw him mount the engine with a woman. That woman was\u2014well,\r\n\r\n      there she sits. Vlassof\u2019s fireman had been killed the evening before, on a\r\n\r\n      barricade; it was Annouchka who took his place. They busied themselves and\r\n\r\n      the train started like a shot. On that curved line, discovered at once,\r\n\r\n      easy to attack, under a shower of bullets, Vlassof developed a speed of\r\n\r\n      ninety versts an hour. He ran the indicator up to the explosion point. The\r\n\r\n      lady over there continued to pile coal into the furnace. The danger came\r\n\r\n      to be less from the military and more from an explosion at any moment. In\r\n\r\n      the midst of the balls Vlassof kept his usual coolness. He sped not only\r\n\r\n      with the firebox open but with the forced draught. It was a miracle that\r\n\r\n      the engine was not smashed against the curve of the embankment. But they\r\n\r\n      got past. Not a man was hurt. Only a woman was wounded. She got a ball in\r\n\r\n      the chest.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere!\u201d cried Annouchka.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With a magnificent gesture she flung open her white and heaving chest, and\r\n\r\n      put her finger on a scar that Gounsovski, whose fat began to melt in heavy\r\n\r\n      drops of sweat about his temples, dared not look at.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFifteen days later,\u201d continued the prince, \u201cVlassof entered an inn at\r\n\r\n      Lubetszy. He didn\u2019t know it was full of soldiers. His face never altered.\r\n\r\n      They searched him. They found a revolver and papers on him. They knew whom\r\n\r\n      they had to do with. He was a good prize. Vlassof was taken to Moscow and\r\n\r\n      condemned to be shot. His sister, wounded as she was, learned of his\r\n\r\n      arrest and joined him. \u2018I do not wish,\u2019 she said to him, \u2018to leave you to\r\n\r\n      die alone.\u2019 She also was condemned. Before the execution the soldiers\r\n\r\n      offered to bandage their eyes, but both refused, saying they preferred to\r\n\r\n      meet death face to face. The orders were to shoot all the other condemned\r\n\r\n      revolutionaries first, then Vlassof, then his sister. It was in vain that\r\n\r\n      Vlassof asked to die last. Their comrades in execution sank to their\r\n\r\n      knees, bleeding from their death wounds. Vlassof embraced his sister and\r\n\r\n      walked to the place of death. There he addressed the soldiers: \u2018Now you\r\n\r\n      have to carry out your duty according to the oath you have taken. Fulfill\r\n\r\n      it honestly as I have fulfilled mine. Captain, give the order.\u2019 The volley\r\n\r\n      sounded. Vlassof remained erect, his arms crossed on his breast, safe and\r\n\r\n      sound. Not a ball had touched him. The soldiers did not wish to fire at\r\n\r\n      him. He had to summon them again to fulfill their duty, and obey their\r\n\r\n      chief. Then they fired again, and he fell. He looked at his sister with\r\n\r\n      his eyes full of horrible suffering. Seeing that he lived, and wishing to\r\n\r\n      appear charitable, the captain, upon Annouchka\u2019s prayers, approached and\r\n\r\n      cut short his sufferings by firing a revolver into his ear. Now it was\r\n\r\n      Annouchka\u2019s turn. She knelt by the body of her brother, kissed his bloody\r\n\r\n      lips, rose and said, \u2018I am ready.\u2019 As the guns were raised, an officer\r\n\r\n      came running, bearing the pardon of the Tsar. She did not wish it, and she\r\n\r\n      whom they had not bound when she was to die had to be restrained when she\r\n\r\n      learned she was to live.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Prince Galitch, amid the anguished silence of all there, started to add\r\n\r\n      some words of comment to his sinister recital, but Annouchka interrupted:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe story is ended,\u201d said she. \u201cNot a word, Prince. If I asked you to\r\n\r\n      tell it in all its horror, if I wished you to bring back to us the\r\n\r\n      atrocious moment of my brother\u2019s death, it is so that monsieur\u201d (her\r\n\r\n      fingers pointed to Gounsovski) \u201cshall know well, once for all, that if I\r\n\r\n      have submitted for some hours now to this promiscuous company that has\r\n\r\n      been imposed upon me, now that I have paid the debt by accepting this\r\n\r\n      abominable supper, I have nothing more to do with this purveyor of bagnios\r\n\r\n      and of hangman\u2019s ropes who is here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is mad,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShe is mad. What has come over her? What has\r\n\r\n      happened? Only to-day she was so, so amiable.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he stuttered, desolately, with an embarrassed laugh:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, the women, the women! Now what have I done to her?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat have you done to me, wretch? Where are Belachof, Bartowsky and\r\n\r\n      Strassof? And Pierre Slutch? All the comrades who swore with me to revenge\r\n\r\n      my brother? Where are they? On what gallows did you have them hung? What\r\n\r\n      mine have you buried them in? And still you follow your slavish task. And\r\n\r\n      my friends, my other friends, the poor comrades of my artist life, the\r\n\r\n      inoffensive young men who have not committed any other crime than to come\r\n\r\n      to see me too often when I was lively, and who believed they could talk\r\n\r\n      freely in my dressing-room\u2014where are they? Why have they left me,\r\n\r\n      one by one? Why have they disappeared? It is you, wretch, who watched\r\n\r\n      them, who spied on them, making me, I haven\u2019t any doubt, your horrible\r\n\r\n      accomplice, mixing me up in your beastly work, you dog! You knew what they\r\n\r\n      call me. You have known it for a long time, and you may well laugh over\r\n\r\n      it. But I, I never knew until this evening; I never learned until this\r\n\r\n      evening all I owe to you. \u2018Stool pigeon! Stool pigeon!\u2019 I! Horror! Ah, you\r\n\r\n      dog, you dog! Your mother, when you were brought into the world, your\r\n\r\n      mother...\u201d Here she hurled at him the most offensive insult that a Russian\r\n\r\n      can offer a man of that race.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She trembled and sobbed with rage, spat in fury, and stood up ready to go,\r\n\r\n      wrapped in her mantle like a great red flag. She was the statue of hate\r\n\r\n      and vengeance. She was horrible and terrible. She was beautiful. At the\r\n\r\n      final supreme insult, Gounsovski started and rose to his feet as though he\r\n\r\n      had received an actual blow in the face. He did not look at Annouchka, but\r\n\r\n      fixed his eyes on Prince Galitch. His finger pointed him out:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is the man,\u201d he hissed, \u201cwho has told you all these fine things.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it is I,\u201d said the Prince, tranquilly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCaracho!\u201d barked Gounsovski, instantaneously regaining his coolness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, yes, but you\u2019ll not touch him,\u201d clamored the spirited girl of the\r\n\r\n      Black Land; \u201cyou are not strong enough for that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know that monsieur has many friends at court,\u201d agreed the chief of the\r\n\r\n      Secret Service with an ominous calm. \u201cI don\u2019t wish ill to monsieur. You\r\n\r\n      speak, madame, of the way some of your friends have had to be sacrificed.\r\n\r\n      I hope that some day you will be better informed, and that you will\r\n\r\n      understand I saved all of them I could.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet us go,\u201d muttered Annouchka. \u201cI shall spit in his face.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, all I could,\u201d replied the other, with his habitual gesture of\r\n\r\n      hanging on to his glasses. \u201cAnd I shall continue to do so. I promise you\r\n\r\n      not to say anything more disagreeable to the prince than as regards his\r\n\r\n      little friend the Bohemian Katharina, whom he has treated so generously\r\n\r\n      just now, doubtless because Boris Mourazoff pays her too little for the\r\n\r\n      errands she runs each morning to the villa of Krestowsky Ostrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At these words the Prince and Annouchka both changed countenance. Their\r\n\r\n      anger rose. Annouchka turned her head as though to arrange the folds of\r\n\r\n      her cloak. Galitch contented himself with shrugging his shoulders\r\n\r\n      impatiently and murmuring:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill some other abomination that you are concocting, monsieur, and that\r\n\r\n      we don\u2019t know how to reply to.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      After which he bowed to the supper-party, took Annouchka\u2019s arm and had her\r\n\r\n      move before him. Gounsovski bowed, almost bent in two. When he rose he saw\r\n\r\n      before him the three astounded and horrified figures of Thaddeus\r\n\r\n      Tchitchnikoff, Ivan Petrovitch and Athanase Georgevitch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMessieurs,\u201d he said to them, in a colorless voice which seemed not to\r\n\r\n      belong to him, \u201cthe time has come for us to part. I need not say that we\r\n\r\n      have supped as friends and that, if you wish it to be so, we can forget\r\n\r\n      everything that has been said here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The three others, frightened, at once protested their discretion. He\r\n\r\n      added, roughly this time, \u201cService of the Tsar,\u201d and the three stammered,\r\n\r\n      \u201cGod save the Tsar!\u201d After which he saw them to the door. When the door\r\n\r\n      had closed after them, he said, \u201cMy little Annouchka, you mustn\u2019t reckon\r\n\r\n      without me.\u201d He hurried toward the sofa, where Rouletabille was lying\r\n\r\n      forgotten, and gave him a tap on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome, get up. Don\u2019t act as though you were asleep. Not an instant to\r\n\r\n      lose. They are going to carry through the Trebassof affair this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was already on his legs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, monsieur,\u201d said he, \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to tell me that. Thanks all\r\n\r\n      the same, and good evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He went out.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski rang. A servant appeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTell them they may now open all the rooms on this corridor; I\u2019ll not hold\r\n\r\n      them any longer.\u201d Thus had Gounsovski kept himself protected.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Left alone, the head of the Secret Service wiped his brow and drank a\r\n\r\n      great glass of iced water which he emptied at a draught. Then he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cKoupriane will have his work cut out for him this evening; I wish him\r\n\r\n      good luck. As to them, whatever happens, I wash my hands of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      X. A DRAMA IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At the door of the Krestowsky Rouletabille, who was in a hurry for a\r\n\r\n      conveyance, jumped into an open carriage where la belle Onoto was already\r\n\r\n      seated. The dancer caught him on her knees.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo Eliaguine, fast as you can,\u201d cried the reporter for all explanation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cScan! Scan! (Quickly, quickly)\u201d repeated Onoto.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She was accompanied by a vague sort of person to whom neither of them paid\r\n\r\n      the least attention.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a supper! You waked up at last, did you?\u201d quizzed the actress. But\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, standing up behind the enormous coachman, urged the horses\r\n\r\n      and directed the route of the carriage. They bolted along through the\r\n\r\n      night at a dizzy pace. At the corner of a bridge he ordered the horses\r\n\r\n      stopped, thanked his companions and disappeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a country! What a country! Caramba!\u201d said the Spanish artist.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The carriage waited a few minutes, then turned back toward the city.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille got down the embankment and slowly, taking infinite\r\n\r\n      precautions not to reveal his presence by making the least noise, made his\r\n\r\n      way to where the river is widest. Seen through the blackness of the night\r\n\r\n      the blacker mass of the Trebassof villa loomed like an enormous blot, he\r\n\r\n      stopped. Then he glided like a snake through the reeds, the grass, the\r\n\r\n      ferns. He was at the back of the villa, near the river, not far from the\r\n\r\n      little path where he had discovered the passage of the assassin, thanks to\r\n\r\n      the broken cobwebs. At that moment the moon rose and the birch-trees,\r\n\r\n      which just before had been like great black staffs, now became white\r\n\r\n      tapers which seemed to brighten that sinister solitude.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter wished to profit at once by the sudden luminance to learn if\r\n\r\n      his movements had been noticed and if the approaches to the villa on that\r\n\r\n      side were guarded. He picked up a small pebble and threw it some distance\r\n\r\n      from him along the path. At the unexpected noise three or four shadowy\r\n\r\n      heads were outlined suddenly in the white light of the moon, but\r\n\r\n      disappeared at once, lost again in the dark tufts of grass.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He had gained his information.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter\u2019s acute ear caught a gliding in his direction, a slight swish\r\n\r\n      of twigs; then all at once a shadow grew by his side and he felt the cold\r\n\r\n      of a revolver barrel on his temple. He said \u201cKoupriane,\u201d and at once a\r\n\r\n      hand seized his and pressed it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The night had become black again. He murmured: \u201cHow is it you are here in\r\n\r\n      person?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Prefect of Police whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have been informed that something will happen to-night. Natacha went to\r\n\r\n      Krestowsky and exchanged some words with Annouchka there. Prince Galitch\r\n\r\n      is involved, and it is an affair of State.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha has returned?\u201d inquired Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, a long time ago. She ought to be in bed. In any case she is\r\n\r\n      pretending to be abed. The light from her chamber, in the window over the\r\n\r\n      garden, has been put out.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you warned Matrena Petrovna?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I have let her know that she must keep on the sharp look-out\r\n\r\n      to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have told her anything. She will take such\r\n\r\n      extra precautions that the others will be instantly warned.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have told her she should not go to the ground-floor at all this night,\r\n\r\n      and that she must not leave the general\u2019s chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is perfect, if she will obey you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou see I have profited by all your information. I have followed your\r\n\r\n      instructions. The road from the Krestowsky is under surveillance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps too much. How are you planning?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe will let them enter. I don\u2019t know whom I have to deal with. I want to\r\n\r\n      strike a sure blow. I shall take him in the act. No more doubt after this,\r\n\r\n      you trust me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAdieu.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo bed. I have paid my debt to my host. I have the right to some repose\r\n\r\n      now. Good luck!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Koupriane had seized his hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      With a little attention they detected a light stroke on the water. If a\r\n\r\n      boat was moving at this time for this bank of the Neva and wished to\r\n\r\n      remain hidden, the right moment had certainly been chosen. A great black\r\n\r\n      cloud covered the moon; the wind was light. The boat would have time to\r\n\r\n      get from one bank to the other without being discovered. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      waited no longer. On all-fours he ran like a beast, rapidly and silently,\r\n\r\n      and rose behind the wall of the villa, where he made a turn, reached the\r\n\r\n      gate, aroused the dvornicks and demanded Ermolai, who opened the gate for\r\n\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Barinia?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai pointed his finger to the bedroom floor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCaracho!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was already across the garden and had hoisted himself by his\r\n\r\n      fingers to the window of Natacha\u2019s chamber, where he listened. He plainly\r\n\r\n      heard Natacha walking about in the dark chamber. He fell back lightly onto\r\n\r\n      his feet, mounted the veranda steps and opened the door, then closed it so\r\n\r\n      lightly that Ermolai, who watched him from outside not two feet away, did\r\n\r\n      not hear the slightest grinding of the hinges. Inside the villa\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille advanced on tiptoe. He found the door of the drawing-room\r\n\r\n      open. The door of the sitting-room had not been closed, or else had been\r\n\r\n      reopened. He turned in his tracks, felt in the dark for a chair and sat\r\n\r\n      down, with his hand on his revolver in his pocket, waiting for the events\r\n\r\n      that would not delay long now. Above he heard distinctly from time to time\r\n\r\n      the movements of Matrena Petrovna. And this would evidently give a sense\r\n\r\n      of security to those who needed to have the ground-floor free this night.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille imagined that the doors of the rooms on the ground-floor had\r\n\r\n      been left open so that it would be easier for those who would be below to\r\n\r\n      hear what was happening upstairs. And perhaps he was not wrong.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly there was a vertical bar of pale light from the sitting-room that\r\n\r\n      overlooked the Neva. He deduced two things: first, that the window was\r\n\r\n      already slightly open, then that the moon was out from the clouds again.\r\n\r\n      The bar of light died almost instantly, but Rouletabille\u2019s eyes, now used\r\n\r\n      to the obscurity, still distinguished the open line of the window. There\r\n\r\n      the shade was less deep. Suddenly he felt the blood pound at his temples,\r\n\r\n      for the line of the open window grew larger, increased, and the shadow of\r\n\r\n      a man gradually rose on the balcony. Rouletabille drew his revolver.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The man stood up immediately behind one of the shutters and struck a light\r\n\r\n      blow on the glass. Placed as he was now he could be seen no more. His\r\n\r\n      shadow mixed with the shadow of the shutter. At the noise on the glass\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s door had opened cautiously, and she entered the sitting-room. On\r\n\r\n      tiptoe she went quickly to the window and opened it. The man entered. The\r\n\r\n      little light that by now was commencing to dawn was enough to show\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille that Natacha still wore the toilette in which he had seen her\r\n\r\n      that same evening at Krestowsky. As for the man, he tried in vain to\r\n\r\n      identify him; he was only a dark mass wrapped in a mantle. He leaned over\r\n\r\n      and kissed Natacha\u2019s hand. She said only one word: \u201cScan!\u201d (Quickly).\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But she had no more than said it before, under a vigorous attack, the\r\n\r\n      shutters and the two halves of the window were thrown wide, and silent\r\n\r\n      shadows jumped rapidly onto the balcony and sprang into the villa. Natacha\r\n\r\n      uttered a shrill cry in which Rouletabille believed still he heard more of\r\n\r\n      despair than terror, and the shadows threw themselves on the man; but he,\r\n\r\n      at the first alarm, had thrown himself upon the carpet and had slipped\r\n\r\n      from them between their legs. He regained the balcony and jumped from it\r\n\r\n      as the others turned toward him. At least, it was so that Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      believed he saw the mysterious struggle go in the half-light, amid most\r\n\r\n      impressive silence, after that frightened cry of Natacha\u2019s. The whole\r\n\r\n      affair had lasted only a few seconds, and the man was still hanging over\r\n\r\n      the balcony, when from the bottom of the hall a new person sprang. It was\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Warned by Koupriane that something would happen that night, and foreseeing\r\n\r\n      that it would happen on the ground-floor where she was forbidden to be,\r\n\r\n      she had found nothing better to do than to make her faithful maid go\r\n\r\n      secretly to the bedroom floor, with orders to walk about there all night,\r\n\r\n      to make all think she herself was near the general, while she remained\r\n\r\n      below, hidden in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna now threw herself out onto the balcony, crying in\r\n\r\n      Russian, \u201cShoot! Shoot!\u201d In just that moment the man was hesitating\r\n\r\n      whether to risk the jump and perhaps break his neck, or descend less\r\n\r\n      rapidly by the gutter-pipe. A policeman fired and missed him, and the man,\r\n\r\n      after firing back and wounding the policeman, disappeared. It was still\r\n\r\n      too far from dawn for them to see clearly what happened below, where the\r\n\r\n      barking of Brownings alone was heard. And there could be nothing more\r\n\r\n      sinister than the revolver-shots unaccompanied by cries in the mists of\r\n\r\n      the morning. The man, before he disappeared, had had only time by a quick\r\n\r\n      kick to throw down one of the two ladders which had been used by the\r\n\r\n      police in climbing; down the other one all the police in a bunch, even to\r\n\r\n      the wounded one, went sliding, falling, rising, running after the shadow\r\n\r\n      which fled still, discharging the Browning steadily; other shadows rose\r\n\r\n      from the river-bank, hovering in the mist. Suddenly Koupriane\u2019s voice was\r\n\r\n      heard shouting orders, calling upon his agents to take the quarry alive or\r\n\r\n      dead. From the balcony Matrena Petrovna cried out also, like a savage, and\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille tried in vain to keep her quiet. She was delirious at the\r\n\r\n      thought \u201cThe Other\u201d might escape yet. She fired a revolver, she also, into\r\n\r\n      the group, not knowing whom she might wound. Rouletabille grabbed her arm\r\n\r\n      and as she turned on him angrily she observed Natacha, who, leaning until\r\n\r\n      she almost fell over the balcony, her lips trembling with delirious\r\n\r\n      utterance, followed as well as she could the progress of the struggle,\r\n\r\n      trying to understand what happened below, under the trees, near the Neva,\r\n\r\n      where the tumult by now extended. Matrena Petrovna pulled her back by the\r\n\r\n      arms. Then she took her by the neck and threw her into the drawing-room in\r\n\r\n      a heap. When she had almost strangled her step-daughter, Matrena Petrovna\r\n\r\n      saw that the general was there. He appeared in the pale glimmerings of\r\n\r\n      dawn like a specter. By what miracle had Feodor Feodorovitch been able to\r\n\r\n      descend the stairs and reach there? How had it been brought about? She saw\r\n\r\n      him tremble with anger or with wretchedness under the folds of the\r\n\r\n      soldier\u2019s cape that floated about him. He demanded in a hoarse voice,\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna threw herself at his feet, made the orthodox sign of the\r\n\r\n      Cross, as if she wished to summon God to witness, and then, pointing to\r\n\r\n      Natacha, she denounced his daughter to her husband as she would have\r\n\r\n      pointed her out to a judge.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe one, Feodor Feodorovitch, who has wished more than once to\r\n\r\n      assassinate you, and who this night has opened the datcha to your assassin\r\n\r\n      is your daughter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general held himself up by his two hands against the wall, and,\r\n\r\n      looking at Matrena and Natacha, who now were both upon the floor before\r\n\r\n      him like suppliants, he said to Matrena:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is you who assassinate me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMe! By the living God!\u201d babbled Matrena Petrovna desperately. \u201cIf I had\r\n\r\n      been able to keep this from you, Jesus would have been good! But I say no\r\n\r\n      more to crucify you. Feodor Feodorovitch, question your daughter, and if\r\n\r\n      what I have said is not true, kill me, kill me as a lying, evil beast. I\r\n\r\n      will say thank you, thank you, and I will die happier than if what I have\r\n\r\n      said was true. Ah, I long to be dead! Kill me!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Feodor Feodorovitch pushed her back with his stick as one would push a\r\n\r\n      worm in his path. Without saying anything further, she rose from her knees\r\n\r\n      and looked with her haggard eyes, with her crazed face, at Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      who grasped her arm. If she had had her hands still free she would not\r\n\r\n      have hesitated a second in wreaking justice upon herself under this bitter\r\n\r\n      fate of alienating Feodor. And it seemed frightful to Rouletabille that he\r\n\r\n      should be present at one of those horrible family dramas the issue of\r\n\r\n      which in the wild times of Peter the Great would have sent the general to\r\n\r\n      the hangman either as a father or as a husband.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general did not deign even to consider for any length of time\r\n\r\n      Matrena\u2019s delirium. He said to his daughter, who shook with sobs on the\r\n\r\n      floor, \u201cRise, Natacha Feodorovna.\u201d And Feodor\u2019s daughter understood that\r\n\r\n      her father never would believe in her guilt. She drew herself up towards\r\n\r\n      him and kissed his hands like a happy slave.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At this moment repeated blows shook the veranda door. Matrena, the\r\n\r\n      watch-dog, anxious to die after Feodor\u2019s reproach, but still at her post,\r\n\r\n      ran toward what she believed to be a new danger. But she recognized\r\n\r\n      Koupriane\u2019s voice, which called on her to open. She let him in herself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she implored.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, he is dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A cry answered him. Natacha had heard.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut who\u2014who\u2014who?\u201d questioned Matrena breathlessly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane went over to Feodor and grasped his hands.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGeneral,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was a man who had sworn your ruin and who was\r\n\r\n      made an instrument by your enemies. We have just killed that man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo I know him?\u201d demanded Feodor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is one of your friends, you have treated him like a son.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis name?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAsk your daughter, General.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Feodor turned toward Natacha, who burned Koupriane with her gaze, trying\r\n\r\n      to learn what this news was he brought\u2014the truth or a ruse.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know the man who wished to kill me, Natacha?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d she replied to her father, in accents of perfect fury. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      know any such man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said Koupriane, in a firm, terribly hostile voice, \u201cyou\r\n\r\n      have yourself, with your own hands, opened that window to-night; and you\r\n\r\n      have opened it to him many other times besides. While everyone else here\r\n\r\n      does his duty and watches that no person shall be able to enter at night\r\n\r\n      the house where sleeps General Trebassof, governor of Moscow, condemned to\r\n\r\n      death by the Central Revolutionary Committee now reunited at Presnia, this\r\n\r\n      is what you do; it is you who introduce the enemy into this place.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnswer, Natacha; tell me, yes or no, whether you have let anybody into\r\n\r\n      this house by night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFather, it is true.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Feodor roared like a lion:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis name!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur will tell you himself,\u201d said Natacha, in a voice thick with\r\n\r\n      terror, and she pointed to Koupriane. \u201cWhy does he not tell you himself\r\n\r\n      the name of that person? He must know it, if the man is dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd if the man is not dead,\u201d replied Feodor, who visibly held onto\r\n\r\n      himself, \u201cif that man, whom you helped to enter my house this night, has\r\n\r\n      succeeded in escaping, as you seem to hope, will you tell us his name?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI could not tell it, Father.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd if I prayed you to do so?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha desperately shook her head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd if I order you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou can kill me, Father, but I will not pronounce that name.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWretch!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He raised his stick toward her. Thus Ivan the Terrible had killed his son\r\n\r\n      with a blow of his boar-spear.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Natacha, instead of bowing her head beneath the blow that menaced her,\r\n\r\n      turned toward Koupriane and threw at him in accents of triumph:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is not dead. If you had succeeded in taking him, dead or alive, you\r\n\r\n      would already have his name.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane took two steps toward her, put his hand on her shoulder and\r\n\r\n      said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMichael Nikolaievitch.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMichael Korsakoff!\u201d cried the general.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna, as if revolted by that suggestion, stood upright to\r\n\r\n      repeat:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMichael Korsakoff!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general could not believe his ears, and was about to protest when he\r\n\r\n      noticed that his daughter had turned away and was trying to flee to her\r\n\r\n      room. He stopped her with a terrible gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha, you are going to tell us what Michael Korsakoff came here to do\r\n\r\n      to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFeodor Feodorovitch, he came to poison you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was Matrena who spoke now and whom nothing could have kept silent, for\r\n\r\n      she saw in Natacha\u2019s attempt at flight the most sinister confession. Like\r\n\r\n      a vengeful fury she told over with cries and terrible gestures what she\r\n\r\n      had experienced, as if once more stretched before her the hand armed with\r\n\r\n      the poison, the mysterious hand above the pillow of her poor invalid, her\r\n\r\n      dear, rigorous tyrant; she told them about the preceding night and all her\r\n\r\n      terrors, and from her lips, by her voluble staccato utterance that ominous\r\n\r\n      recital had grotesque emphasis. Finally she told all that she had done,\r\n\r\n      she and the little Frenchman, in order not to betray their suspicions to\r\n\r\n      The Other, in order to take finally in their own trap all those who for so\r\n\r\n      many days and nights schemed for the death of Feodor Feodorovitch. As she\r\n\r\n      ended she pointed out Rouletabille to Feodor and cried, \u201cThere is the one\r\n\r\n      who has saved you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha, as she listened to this tragic recital, restrained herself\r\n\r\n      several times in order not to interrupt, and Rouletabille, who was\r\n\r\n      watching her closely, saw that she had to use almost superhuman efforts in\r\n\r\n      order to achieve that. All the horror of what seemed to be to her as well\r\n\r\n      as to Feodor a revelation of Michael\u2019s crime did not subdue her, but\r\n\r\n      seemed, on the contrary, to restore to her in full force all the life that\r\n\r\n      a few seconds earlier had fled from her. Matrena had hardly finished her\r\n\r\n      cry, \u201cThere is the one who has saved you,\u201d before Natacha cried in her\r\n\r\n      turn, facing the reporter with a look full of the most frightful hate,\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is the one who has been the death of an innocent man!\u201d She turned\r\n\r\n      to her father. \u201cAh, papa, let me, let me say that Michael Nikolaievitch,\r\n\r\n      who came here this evening, I admit, and whom, it is true, I let into the\r\n\r\n      house, that Michael Nikolaievitch did not come here yesterday, and that\r\n\r\n      the man who has tried to poison you is certainly someone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At these words Rouletabille turned pale, but he did not let himself lose\r\n\r\n      self-control. He replied simply:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, mademoiselle, it was the same man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Koupriane felt compelled to add:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnyway, we have found the proof of Michael Nikolaievitch\u2019s relations with\r\n\r\n      the revolutionaries.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere have you found that?\u201d questioned the young girl, turning toward the\r\n\r\n      Chief of Police a face ravished with anguish.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt Krestowsky, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She looked a long time at him as though she would penetrate to the bottom\r\n\r\n      of his thoughts.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat proofs?\u201d she implored.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA correspondence which we have placed under seal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWas it addressed to him? What kind of correspondence?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf it interests you, we will open it before you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy God! My God!\u201d she gasped. \u201cWhere have you found this correspondence?\r\n\r\n      Where? Tell me where!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will tell you. At the villa, in his chamber. We forced the lock of his\r\n\r\n      bureau.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She seemed to breathe again, but her father took her brutally by the arm.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome, Natacha, you are going to tell us what that man was doing here\r\n\r\n      to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn her chamber!\u201d cried Matrena Petrovna.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha turned toward Matrena:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you believe, then? Tell me now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd I, what ought I to believe?\u201d muttered Feodor. \u201cYou have not told me\r\n\r\n      yet. You did not know that man had relations with my enemies. You are\r\n\r\n      innocent of that, perhaps. I wish to think so. I wish it, in the name of\r\n\r\n      Heaven I wish it. But why did you receive him? Why? Why did you bring him\r\n\r\n      in here, as a robber or as a...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, papa, you know that I love Boris, that I love him with all my heart,\r\n\r\n      and that I would never belong to anyone but him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, then, then.\u2014speak!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The young girl had reached the crisis.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, Father, Father, do not question me! You, you above all, do not\r\n\r\n      question me now. I can say nothing! There is nothing I can tell you.\r\n\r\n      Excepting that I am sure\u2014sure, you understand\u2014that Michael\r\n\r\n      Nikolaievitch did not come here last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe did come,\u201d insisted Rouletabille in a slightly troubled voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe came here with poison. He came here to poison your father, Natacha,\u201d\r\n\r\n       moaned Matrena Petrovna, who twined her hands in gestures of sincere and\r\n\r\n      naive tragedy.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd I,\u201d replied the daughter of Feodor ardently, with an accent of\r\n\r\n      conviction which made everyone there vibrate, and particularly\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, \u201cand I, I tell you it was not he, that it was not he, that\r\n\r\n      it could not possibly be he. I swear to you it was another, another.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut then, this other, did you let him in as well?\u201d said Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, yes, yes. It was I. It was I. It was I who left the window and blinds\r\n\r\n      open. Yes, it is I who did that. But I did not wait for the other, the\r\n\r\n      other who came to assassinate. As to Michael Nikolaievitch, I swear to\r\n\r\n      you, my father, by all that is most sacred in heaven and on earth, that he\r\n\r\n      could not have committed the crime that you say. And now\u2014kill me,\r\n\r\n      for there is nothing more I can say.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe poison,\u201d replied Koupriane coldly, \u201cthe poison that he poured into\r\n\r\n      the general\u2019s potion was that arsenate of soda which was on the grapes the\r\n\r\n      Marshal of the Court brought here. Those grapes were left by the Marshal,\r\n\r\n      who warned Michael Nikolaievitch and Boris Alexandrovitch to wash them.\r\n\r\n      The grapes disappeared. If Michael is innocent, do you accuse Boris?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha, who seemed to have suddenly lost all power for defending herself,\r\n\r\n      moaned, begged, railed, seemed dying.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t accuse Boris. He has nothing to do with it. Don\u2019t accuse\r\n\r\n      Michael. Don\u2019t accuse anyone so long as you don\u2019t know. But these two are\r\n\r\n      innocent. Believe me. Believe me. Ah, how shall I say it, how shall I\r\n\r\n      persuade you! I am not able to say anything to you. And you have killed\r\n\r\n      Michael. Ah, what have you done, what have you done!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have suppressed a man,\u201d said the icy voice of Koupriane, \u201cwho was\r\n\r\n      merely the agent for the base deeds of Nihilism.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She succeeded in recovering a new energy that in her depths of despair\r\n\r\n      they would have supposed impossible. She shook her fists at Koupriane:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is not true, it is not true. These are slanders, infamies! The\r\n\r\n      inventions of the police! Papers devised to incriminate him. There is\r\n\r\n      nothing at all of what you said you found at his house. It is not\r\n\r\n      possible. It is not true.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere are those papers?\u201d demanded the curt voice of Feodor. \u201cBring them\r\n\r\n      here at once, Koupriane; I wish to see them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane was slightly troubled, and this did not escape Natacha, who\r\n\r\n      cried:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, let him give us them, let him bring them if he has them. But he\r\n\r\n      hasn\u2019t,\u201d she clamored with a savage joy. \u201cHe has nothing. You can see,\r\n\r\n      papa, that he has nothing. He would already have brought them out. He has\r\n\r\n      nothing. I tell you he has nothing. Ah, he has nothing! He has nothing!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And she threw herself on the floor, weeping, sobbing, \u201cHe has nothing, he\r\n\r\n      has nothing!\u201d She seemed to weep for joy.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs that true?\u201d demanded Feodor Feodorovitch, with his most somber manner.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it true, Koupriane, that you have nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is true, General, that we have found nothing. Everything had already\r\n\r\n      been carried away.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Natacha uttered a veritable torrent of glee:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe has found nothing! Yet he accuses him of being allied with the\r\n\r\n      revolutionaries. Why? Why? Because I let him in? But I, am I a\r\n\r\n      revolutionary? Tell me. Have I sworn to kill papa? I? I? Ah, he doesn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      know what to say. You see for yourself, papa, he is silent. He has lied.\r\n\r\n      He has lied.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy have you made this false statement, Koupriane?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, we have suspected Michael for some time, and truly, after what has\r\n\r\n      just happened, we cannot have any doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, but you declared you had papers, and you have not. That is\r\n\r\n      abominable procedure, Koupriane,\u201d replied Feodor sternly. \u201cI have heard\r\n\r\n      you condemn such expedients many times.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGeneral! We are sure, you hear, we are absolutely sure that the man who\r\n\r\n      tried to poison you yesterday and the man to-day who is dead are one and\r\n\r\n      the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what reason have you for being so sure? It is necessary to tell it,\u201d\r\n\r\n       insisted the general, who trembled with distress and impatience.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, let him tell now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAsk monsieur,\u201d said Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They all turned to Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter replied, affecting a coolness that perhaps he did not\r\n\r\n      entirely feel:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am able to state to you, as I already have before Monsieur the Prefect\r\n\r\n      of Police, that one, and only one, person has left the traces of his\r\n\r\n      various climbings on the wall and on the balcony.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIdiot!\u201d interrupted Natacha, with a passionate disdain for the young man.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd that satisfies you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general roughly seized the reporter\u2019s wrist:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen to me, monsieur. A man came here this night. That concerns only\r\n\r\n      me. No one has any right to be astonished excepting myself. I make it my\r\n\r\n      own affair, an affair between my daughter and me. But you, you have just\r\n\r\n      told us that you are sure that man is an assassin. Then, you see, that\r\n\r\n      calls for something else. Proofs are necessary, and I want the proofs at\r\n\r\n      once. You speak of traces; very well, we will go and examine those traces\r\n\r\n      together. And I wish for your sake, monsieur, that I shall be as convinced\r\n\r\n      by them as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille quietly disengaged his wrist and replied with perfect calm:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, monsieur, I am no longer able to prove anything to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause the ladders of the police agents have wiped out all my proofs,\r\n\r\n      monsieur.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo now there remains for us only your word, only your belief in yourself.\r\n\r\n      And if you are mistaken?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe would never admit it, papa,\u201d cried Natacha. \u201cAh, it is he who deserves\r\n\r\n      the fate Michael Nikolaievitch has met just now. Isn\u2019t it so? Don\u2019t you\r\n\r\n      know it? And that will be your eternal remorse! Isn\u2019t there something that\r\n\r\n      always keeps you from admitting that you are mistaken? You have had an\r\n\r\n      innocent man killed. Now, you know well enough, you know well that I would\r\n\r\n      not have admitted Michael Nikolaievitch here if I had believed he was\r\n\r\n      capable of wishing to poison my father.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d replied Rouletabille, not lowering his eyes under\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s thunderous regard, \u201cI am sure of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He said it in such a tone that Natacha continued to look at him with\r\n\r\n      incomprehensible anguish in her eyes. Ah, the baffling of those two\r\n\r\n      regards, the mute scene between those two young people, one of whom wished\r\n\r\n      to make himself understood and the other afraid beyond all other things of\r\n\r\n      being thoroughly understood. Natacha murmured:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow he looks at me! See, he is the demon; yes, yes, the little domovoi,\r\n\r\n      the little domovoi. But look out, poor wretch; you don\u2019t know what you\r\n\r\n      have done.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She turned brusquely toward Koupriane:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere is the body of Michael Nikolaievitch?\u201d said she. \u201cI wish to see it.\r\n\r\n      I must see it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Feodor Feodorovitch had fallen, as though asleep, upon a chair. Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna dared not approach him. The giant appeared hurt to the death,\r\n\r\n      disheartened forever. What neither bombs, nor bullets, nor poison had been\r\n\r\n      able to do, the single idea of his daughter\u2019s co-operation in the work of\r\n\r\n      horror plotted about him\u2014or rather the impossibility he faced of\r\n\r\n      understanding Natacha\u2019s attitude, her mysterious conduct, the chaos of her\r\n\r\n      explanations, her insensate cries, her protestations of innocence, her\r\n\r\n      accusations, her menaces, her prayers and all her disorder, the avowed\r\n\r\n      fact of her share in that tragic nocturnal adventure where Michael\r\n\r\n      Nikolaievitch found his death, had knocked over Feodor Feodorovitch like a\r\n\r\n      straw. One instant he sought refuge in some vague hope that Koupriane was\r\n\r\n      less assured than he pretended of the orderly\u2019s guilt. But that, after\r\n\r\n      all, was only a detail of no importance in his eyes. What alone mattered\r\n\r\n      was the significance of Natacha\u2019s act, and the unhappy girl seemed not to\r\n\r\n      be concerned over what he would think of it. She was there to fight\r\n\r\n      against Koupriane, Rouletabille and Matrena Petrovna, defending her\r\n\r\n      Michael Nikolaievitch, while he, the father, after having failed to\r\n\r\n      overawe her just now, was there in a corner suffering agonizedly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane walked over to him and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen to me carefully, Feodor Feodorovitch. He who speaks to you is Head\r\n\r\n      of the Police by the will of the Tsar, and your friend by the grace of\r\n\r\n      God. If you do not demand before us, who are acquainted with all that has\r\n\r\n      happened and who know how to keep any necessary secret, if you do not\r\n\r\n      demand of your daughter the reason for her conduct with Michael\r\n\r\n      Nikolaievitch, and if she does not tell you in all sincerity, there is\r\n\r\n      nothing more for me to do here. My men have already been ordered away from\r\n\r\n      this house as unworthy to guard the most loyal subject of His Majesty; I\r\n\r\n      have not protested, but now I in my turn ask you to prove to me that the\r\n\r\n      most dangerous enemy you have had in your house is not your daughter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      These words, which summed up the horrible situation, came as a relief for\r\n\r\n      Feodor. Yes, they must know. Koupriane was right. She must speak. He\r\n\r\n      ordered his daughter to tell everything, everything.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha fixed Koupriane again with her look of hatred to the death, turned\r\n\r\n      from him and repeated in a firm voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is the accomplice of your assassins,\u201d growled Koupriane then, his\r\n\r\n      arm extended.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha uttered a cry like a wounded beast and fell at her father\u2019s feet.\r\n\r\n      She gathered them within her supplicating arms. She pressed them to her\r\n\r\n      breasts. She sobbed from the bottom of her heart. And he, not\r\n\r\n      comprehending, let her lie there, distant, hostile, somber. Then she\r\n\r\n      moaned, distractedly, and wept bitterly, and the dramatic atmosphere in\r\n\r\n      which she thus suddenly enveloped Feodor made it all sound like those\r\n\r\n      cries of an earlier time when the all-powerful, punishing father appeared\r\n\r\n      in the women\u2019s apartments to punish the culpable ones.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy father! Dear Father! Look at me! Look at me! Have pity on me, and do\r\n\r\n      not require me to speak when I must be silent forever. And believe me! Do\r\n\r\n      not believe these men! Do not believe Matrena Petrovna. And am I not your\r\n\r\n      daughter? Your very own daughter! Your Natacha Feodorovna! I cannot make\r\n\r\n      things dear to you. No, no, by the Holy Virgin Mother of Jesus I cannot\r\n\r\n      explain. By the holy ikons, it is because I must not. By my mother, whom I\r\n\r\n      have not known and whose place you have taken, oh, my father, ask me\r\n\r\n      nothing more! Ask me nothing more! But take me in your arms as you did\r\n\r\n      when I was little; embrace me, dear father; love me. I never have had such\r\n\r\n      need to be loved. Love me! I am miserable. Unfortunate me, who cannot even\r\n\r\n      kill myself before your eyes to prove my innocence and my love. Papa,\r\n\r\n      Papa! What will your arms be for in the days left you to live, if you no\r\n\r\n      longer wish to press me to your heart? Papa! Papa!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She laid her head on Feodor\u2019s knees. Her hair had come down and hung about\r\n\r\n      her in a magnificent disorderly mass of black.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook in my eyes! Look in my eyes! See how they love you, Batouchka!\r\n\r\n      Batouchka! My dear Batouchka!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then Feodor wept. His great tears fell upon Natacha\u2019s tears. He raised her\r\n\r\n      head and demanded simply in a broken voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou can tell me nothing now? But when will you tell me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha lifted her eyes to his, then her look went past him toward heaven,\r\n\r\n      and from her lips came just one word, in a sob:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna, Koupriane and the reporter shuddered before the high and\r\n\r\n      terrible thing that happened then. Feodor had taken his daughter\u2019s face\r\n\r\n      between his hands. He looked long at those eyes raised toward heaven, the\r\n\r\n      mouth which had just uttered the word \u201cNever,\u201d then, slowly, his rude lips\r\n\r\n      went to the tortured, quivering lips of the girl. He held her close. She\r\n\r\n      raised her head wildly, triumphantly, and cried, with arm extended toward\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe believes me! He believes me! And you would have believed me also if\r\n\r\n      you had been my real mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Her head fell back and she dropped unconscious to the floor. Feodor fell\r\n\r\n      to his knees, tending her, deploring her, motioning the others out of the\r\n\r\n      room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo away! All of you, go! All! You, too, Matrena Petrovna. Go away!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They disappeared, terrified by his savage gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      In the little datcha across the river at Krestowsky there was a body.\r\n\r\n      Secret Service agents guarded it while they waited for their chief.\r\n\r\n      Michael Nikolaievitch had come there to die, and the police had reached\r\n\r\n      him just at his last breath. They were behind him as, with the\r\n\r\n      death-rattle in his throat, he pulled himself into his chamber and fell in\r\n\r\n      a heap. Katharina the Bohemian was there. She bent her quick-witted,\r\n\r\n      puzzled head over his death agony. The police swarmed everywhere,\r\n\r\n      ransacking, forcing locks, pulling drawers from the bureau and tables,\r\n\r\n      emptying the cupboards. Their search took in everything, even to ripping\r\n\r\n      the mattresses, and not respecting the rooms of Boris Mourazoff, who was\r\n\r\n      away this night. They searched thoroughly, but they found absolutely\r\n\r\n      nothing they were looking for in Michael\u2019s rooms. But they accumulated a\r\n\r\n      multitude of publications that belonged to Boris: Western books, essays on\r\n\r\n      political economy, a history of the French Revolution, and verses that a\r\n\r\n      man ought to hang for. They put them all under seal. During the search\r\n\r\n      Michael died in Katharina\u2019s arms. She had held him close, after opening\r\n\r\n      his clothes over the chest, doubtless to make his last breaths easier. The\r\n\r\n      unfortunate officer had received a bullet at the back of the head just\r\n\r\n      after he had plunged into the Neva from the rear of the Trebassof datcha\r\n\r\n      and started to swim across. It was a miracle that he had managed to keep\r\n\r\n      going. Doubtless he hoped to die in peace if only he could reach his own\r\n\r\n      house. He apparently had believed he could manage that once he had broken\r\n\r\n      through his human bloodhounds. He did not know he was recognized and his\r\n\r\n      place of retreat therefore known.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Now the police had gone from cellar to garret. Koupriane came from the\r\n\r\n      Trebassof villa and joined them, Rouletabille followed him. The reporter\r\n\r\n      could not stand the sight of that body, that still had a lingering warmth,\r\n\r\n      of the great open eyes that seemed to stare at him, reproaching him for\r\n\r\n      this violent death. He turned away in distaste, and perhaps a little in\r\n\r\n      fright. Koupriane caught the movement.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRegrets?\u201d he queried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cA death always must be regretted. None the\r\n\r\n      less, he was a criminal. But I\u2019m sincerely sorry he died before he had\r\n\r\n      been driven to confess, even though we are sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBeing in the pay of the Nihilists, you mean? That is still your opinion?\u201d\r\n\r\n       asked Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know that nothing has been found here in his rooms. The only\r\n\r\n      compromising papers that have been found belong to Boris Mourazoff.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh\u2014nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane questioned his men further. They replied categorically. No,\r\n\r\n      nothing had been found that directly incriminated anybody; and suddenly\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille noted that the conversation of the police and their chief had\r\n\r\n      grown more animated. Koupriane had become angry and was violently\r\n\r\n      reproaching them. They excused themselves with vivid gesture and rapid\r\n\r\n      speech.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane started away. Rouletabille followed him. What had happened?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As he came up behind Koupriane, he asked the question. In a few curt\r\n\r\n      words, still hurrying on, Koupriane told the reporter he had just learned\r\n\r\n      that the police had left the little Bohemian Katharina alone for a moment\r\n\r\n      with the expiring officer. Katharina acted as housekeeper for Michael and\r\n\r\n      Boris. She knew the secrets of them both. The first thing any novice\r\n\r\n      should have known was to keep a constant eye upon her, and now no one knew\r\n\r\n      where she was. She must be searched for and found at once, for she had\r\n\r\n      opened Michael\u2019s shirt, and therein probably lay the reason that no papers\r\n\r\n      were found on the corpse when the police searched it. The absence of\r\n\r\n      papers, of a portfolio, was not natural.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The chase commenced in the rosy dawn of the isles. Already blood-like\r\n\r\n      tints were on the horizon. Some of the police cried that they had the\r\n\r\n      trail. They ran under the trees, because it was almost certain she had\r\n\r\n      taken the narrow path leading to the bridge that joins Krestowsky to\r\n\r\n      Kameny-Ostrow. Some indications discovered by the police who swarmed to\r\n\r\n      right and left of the path confirmed this hypothesis. And no carriage in\r\n\r\n      sight! They all ran on, Koupriane among the first. Rouletabille kept at\r\n\r\n      his heels, but he did not pass him. Suddenly there were cries and calls\r\n\r\n      among the police. One pointed out something below gliding upon the sloping\r\n\r\n      descent. It was little Katharina. She flew like the wind, but in a\r\n\r\n      distracted course. She had reached Kameny-Ostrow on the west bank. \u201cOh,\r\n\r\n      for a carriage, a horse!\u201d clamored Koupriane, who had left his turn-out at\r\n\r\n      Eliaguine. \u201cThe proof is there. It is the final proof of everything that\r\n\r\n      is escaping us!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Dawn was enough advanced now to show the ground clearly. Katharina was\r\n\r\n      easily discernible as she reached the Eliaguine bridge. There she was in\r\n\r\n      Eliaguine-Ostrow. What was she doing there? Was she going to the Trebassof\r\n\r\n      villa? What would she have to say to them? No, she swerved to the right.\r\n\r\n      The police raced behind her. She was still far ahead, and seemed untiring.\r\n\r\n      Then she disappeared among the trees, in the thicket, keeping still to the\r\n\r\n      right. Koupriane gave a cry of joy. Going that way she must be taken. He\r\n\r\n      gave some breathless orders for the island to be barred. She could not\r\n\r\n      escape now! She could not escape! But where was she going? Koupriane knew\r\n\r\n      that island better than anybody. He took a short cut to reach the other\r\n\r\n      side, toward which Katharina seemed to be heading, and all at once he\r\n\r\n      nearly fell over the girl, who gave a squawk of surprise and rushed away,\r\n\r\n      seeming all arms and legs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStop, or I fire!\u201d cried Koupriane, and he drew his revolver. But a hand\r\n\r\n      grabbed it from him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot that!\u201d said Rouletabille, as he threw the revolver far from them.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane swore at him and resumed the chase. His fury multiplied his\r\n\r\n      strength, his agility; he almost reached Katharina, who was almost out of\r\n\r\n      breath, but Rouletabille threw himself into the Chief\u2019s arms and they\r\n\r\n      rolled together upon the grass. When Koupriane rose, it was to see\r\n\r\n      Katharina mounting in mad haste the stairs that led to the Barque, the\r\n\r\n      floating restaurant of the Strielka. Cursing Rouletabille, but believing\r\n\r\n      his prey easily captured now, the Chief in his turn hurried to the Barque,\r\n\r\n      into which Katharina had disappeared. He reached the bottom of the stairs.\r\n\r\n      On the top step, about to descend from the festive place, the form of\r\n\r\n      Prince Galitch appeared. Koupriane received the sight like a blow stopping\r\n\r\n      him short in his ascent. Galitch had an exultant air which Koupriane did\r\n\r\n      not mistake. Evidently he had arrived too late. He felt the certainty of\r\n\r\n      it in profound discouragement. And this appearance of the prince on the\r\n\r\n      Barque explained convincingly enough the reason for Katharina\u2019s flight\r\n\r\n      here.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      If the Bohemian had filched the papers or the portfolio from the dead, it\r\n\r\n      was the prince now who had them in his pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane, as he saw the prince about to pass him, trembled. The prince\r\n\r\n      saluted him and ironically amused himself by inquiring:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, well, how do you do, my dear Monsieur Koupriane. Your Excellency\r\n\r\n      has risen in good time this morning, it seems to me. Or else it is I who\r\n\r\n      start for bed too late.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrince,\u201d said Koupriane, \u201cmy men are in pursuit of a little Bohemian\r\n\r\n      named Katharina, well known in the restaurants where she sings. We have\r\n\r\n      seen her go into the Barque. Have you met her by any chance?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood Lord, Monsieur Koupriane, I am not the concierge of the Barque, and\r\n\r\n      I have not noticed anything at all, and nobody. Besides, I am naturally a\r\n\r\n      little sleepy. Pardon me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrince, it is not possible that you have not seen Katharina.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, Monsieur the Prefect of Police, if I had seen her I would not tell\r\n\r\n      you about it, since you are pursuing her. Do you take me for one of your\r\n\r\n      bloodhounds? They say you have them in all classes, but I insist that I\r\n\r\n      haven\u2019t enlisted yet. You have made a mistake, Monsieur Koupriane.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The prince saluted again. But Koupriane still stood in his way.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrince, consider that this matter is very serious. Michael Nikolaievitch,\r\n\r\n      General Trebassof\u2019s orderly, is dead, and this little girl has stolen his\r\n\r\n      papers from his body. All persons who have spoken with Katharina will be\r\n\r\n      under suspicion. This is an affair of State, monsieur, which may reach\r\n\r\n      very far. Can you swear to me that you have not seen, that you have not\r\n\r\n      spoken to Katharina?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The prince looked at Koupriane so insolently that the Prefect turned pale\r\n\r\n      with rage. Ah, if he were able\u2014if he only dared!\u2014but such men\r\n\r\n      as this were beyond him. Galitch walked past him without a word of answer,\r\n\r\n      and ordered the schwitzar to call him a carriage.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d said Koupriane, \u201cI will make my report to the Tsar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Galitch turned. He was as pale as Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn that case, monsieur,\u201d said he, \u201cdon\u2019t forget to add that I am His\r\n\r\n      Majesty\u2019s most humble servant.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The carriage drew up. The prince stepped in. Koupriane watched him roll\r\n\r\n      away, raging at heart and with his fists doubled. Just then his men came\r\n\r\n      up.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo. Search,\u201d he said roughly, pointing into the Barque.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They scattered through the establishment, entering all the rooms. Cries of\r\n\r\n      irritation and of protest arose. Those lingering after the latest of late\r\n\r\n      suppers were not pleased at this invasion of the police. Everybody had to\r\n\r\n      rise while the police looked under the tables, the benches, the long\r\n\r\n      table-cloths. They went into the pantries and down into the hold. No sign\r\n\r\n      of Katharina. Suddenly Koupriane, who leaned against a netting and looked\r\n\r\n      vaguely out upon the horizon, waiting for the outcome of the search, got a\r\n\r\n      start. Yonder, far away on the other side of the river, between a little\r\n\r\n      wood and the Staria Derevnia, a light boat drew to the shore, and a little\r\n\r\n      black spot jumped from it like a flea. Koupriane recognized the little\r\n\r\n      black spot as Katharina. She was safe. Now he could not reach her. It would\r\n\r\n      be useless to search the maze of the Bohemian quarter, where her\r\n\r\n      country-people lived in full control, with customs and privileges that had\r\n\r\n      never been infringed. The entire Bohemian population of the capital would\r\n\r\n      have risen against him. It was Prince Galitch who had made him fail. One\r\n\r\n      of his men came to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo luck,\u201d said he. \u201cWe have not found Katharina, but she has been here\r\n\r\n      nevertheless. She met Prince Galitch for just a minute, and gave him\r\n\r\n      something, then went over the other side into a canoe.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d and the Prefect shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI was sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He felt more and more, exasperated. He went down along the river edge and\r\n\r\n      the first person he saw was Rouletabille, who waited for him without any\r\n\r\n      impatience, seated philosophically on a bench.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was looking for you,\u201d cried the Prefect. \u201cWe have failed. By your\r\n\r\n      fault! If you had not thrown yourself into my arms\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did it on purpose,\u201d declared the reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! What is that you say? You did it on purpose?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane choked with rage.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour Excellency,\u201d said Rouletabille, taking him by the arm, \u201ccalm\r\n\r\n      yourself. They are watching us. Come along and have a cup of tea at\r\n\r\n      Cubat\u2019s place. Easy now, as though we were out for a walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWill you explain to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, Your Excellency. Remember that I have promised you General\r\n\r\n      Trebassof\u2019s life in exchange for your prisoner\u2019s. Very well; by throwing\r\n\r\n      myself in your arms and keeping you from reaching Katharina, I saved the\r\n\r\n      general\u2019s life. It is very simple.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you laughing at me? Do you think you can mock me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the prefect saw quickly that Rouletabille was not fooling and had no\r\n\r\n      mockery in his manner.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d he insisted, \u201csince you speak seriously, I certainly wish to\r\n\r\n      understand\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is useless,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cIt is very necessary that you should\r\n\r\n      not understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut at least...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, I can\u2019t tell you anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen, then, will you tell me something to explain your unbelievable\r\n\r\n      conduct?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille stopped in his tracks and declared solemnly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Koupriane, recall what Natacha Feodorovna as she raised her\r\n\r\n      lovely eyes to heaven, replied to her father, when he, also, wished to\r\n\r\n      understand: \u2018Never.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XI. THE POISON CONTINUES\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At ten o\u2019clock that morning Rouletabille went to the Trebassof villa,\r\n\r\n      which had its guard of secret agents again, a double guard, because\r\n\r\n      Koupriane was sure the Nihilists would not delay in avenging Michael\u2019s\r\n\r\n      death. Rouletabille was met by Ermolai, who would not allow him to enter.\r\n\r\n      The faithful servant uttered some explanation in Russian, which the young\r\n\r\n      man did not understand, or, rather, Rouletabille understood perfectly from\r\n\r\n      his manner that henceforth the door of the villa was closed to him. In\r\n\r\n      vain he insisted on seeing the general, Matrena Petrovna and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Natacha. Ermolai made no reply but \u201cNiet, niet, niet.\u201d The reporter turned\r\n\r\n      away without having seen anyone, and walked away deeply depressed. He went\r\n\r\n      afoot clear into the city, a long promenade, during which his brain surged\r\n\r\n      with the darkest forebodings. As he passed by the Department of Police he\r\n\r\n      resolved to see Koupriane again. He went in, gave his name, and was\r\n\r\n      ushered at once to the Chief of Police, whom he found bent over a long\r\n\r\n      report that he was reading through with noticeable agitation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGounsovski has sent me this,\u201d he said in a rough voice, pointing to the\r\n\r\n      report. \u201cGounsovski, \u2018to do me a service,\u2019 desires me to know that he is\r\n\r\n      fully aware of all that happened at the Trebassof datcha last night. He\r\n\r\n      warns me that the revolutionaries have decided to get through with the\r\n\r\n      general at once, and that two of them have been given the mission to enter\r\n\r\n      the datcha in any way possible. They will have bombs upon their bodies and\r\n\r\n      will blow the bombs and themselves up together as soon as they are beside\r\n\r\n      the general. Who are the two victims designated for this horrible\r\n\r\n      vengeance, and who have light-heartedly accepted such a death for\r\n\r\n      themselves as well as for the general? That is what we don\u2019t know. That is\r\n\r\n      what we would have known, perhaps, if you had not prevented me from\r\n\r\n      seizing the papers that Prince Galitch has now,\u201d Koupriane finished,\r\n\r\n      turning hostilely toward Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had turned pale.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t regret what happened to the papers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is I who tell you\r\n\r\n      not to. But what you say doesn\u2019t surprise me. They must believe that\r\n\r\n      Natacha has betrayed them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, then you admit at last that she really is their accomplice?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI haven\u2019t said that and I don\u2019t admit it. But I know what I mean, and\r\n\r\n      you, you can\u2019t. Only, know this one thing, that at the present moment I am\r\n\r\n      the only person able to save you in this horrible situation. To do that I\r\n\r\n      must see Natacha at once. Make her understand this, while I wait at my\r\n\r\n      hotel for word. I\u2019ll not leave it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille saluted Koupriane and went out.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Two days passed, during which Rouletabille did not receive any word from\r\n\r\n      either Natacha or Koupriane, and tried in vain to see them. He made a trip\r\n\r\n      for a few hours to Finland, going as far as Pergalovo, an isolated town\r\n\r\n      said to be frequented by the revolutionaries, then returned, much\r\n\r\n      disturbed, to his hotel, after having written a last letter to Natacha\r\n\r\n      imploring an interview. The minutes passed very slowly for him in the\r\n\r\n      hotel\u2019s vestibule, where he had seemed to have taken up a definite\r\n\r\n      residence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Installed on a bench, he seemed to have become part of the hotel staff,\r\n\r\n      and more than one traveler took him for an interpreter. Others thought he\r\n\r\n      was an agent of the Secret Police appointed to study the faces of those\r\n\r\n      arriving and departing. What was he waiting for, then? Was it for\r\n\r\n      Annouchka to return for a luncheon or dinner in that place that she\r\n\r\n      sometimes frequented? And did he at the same time keep watch upon\r\n\r\n      Annouchka\u2019s apartments just across the way? If that was so, he could only\r\n\r\n      bewail his luck, for Annouchka did not appear either at her apartments or\r\n\r\n      the hotel, or at the Krestowsky establishment, which had been obliged to\r\n\r\n      suppress her performance. Rouletabille naturally thought, in the latter\r\n\r\n      connection, that some vengeance by Gounsovski lay back of this, since the\r\n\r\n      head of the Secret Service could hardly forget the way he had been\r\n\r\n      treated. The reporter could see already the poor singer, in spite of all\r\n\r\n      her safeguards and the favor of the Imperial family, on the road to the\r\n\r\n      Siberian steppes or the dungeons of Schlusselbourg.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy, what a country!\u201d he murmured.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But his thoughts soon quit Annouchka and returned to the object of his\r\n\r\n      main preoccupation. He waited for only one thing, and for that as soon as\r\n\r\n      possible\u2014to have a private interview with Natacha. He had written\r\n\r\n      her ten letters in two days, but they all remained unanswered. It was an\r\n\r\n      answer that he waited for so patiently in the vestibule of the hotel\u2014so\r\n\r\n      patiently, but so nervously, so feverishly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When the postman entered, poor Rouletabille\u2019s heart beat rapidly. On that\r\n\r\n      answer he waited for depended the formidable part he meant to play before\r\n\r\n      quitting Russia. He had accomplished nothing up to now, unless he could\r\n\r\n      play his part in this later development.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the letter did not come. The postman left, and the schwitzar, after\r\n\r\n      examining all the mail, made him a negative sign. Ah, the servants who\r\n\r\n      entered, and the errand-boys, how he looked at them! But they never came\r\n\r\n      for him. Finally, at six o\u2019clock in the evening of the second day, a man\r\n\r\n      in a frock-coat, with a false astrakhan collar, came in and handed the\r\n\r\n      concierge a letter for Joseph Rouletabille. The reporter jumped up. Before\r\n\r\n      the man was out the door he had torn open the letter and read it. The\r\n\r\n      letter was not from Natacha. It was from Gounsovski. This is what it said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille, if it will not inconvenience you, I\r\n\r\n      wish you would come and dine with me to-day. I will look for you within\r\n\r\n      two hours. Madame Gounsovski will be pleased to make your acquaintance.\r\n\r\n      Believe me your devoted Gounsovski.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille considered, and decided:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will go. He ought to have wind of what is being plotted, and as for me,\r\n\r\n      I don\u2019t know where Annouchka has gone. I have more to learn from him than\r\n\r\n      he has from me. Besides, as Athanase Georgevitch said, one may regret not\r\n\r\n      accepting the Head of the Okrana\u2019s pleasant invitation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      From six o\u2019clock to seven he still waited vainly for Natacha\u2019s response.\r\n\r\n      At seven o\u2019clock, he decided to dress for the dinner. Just as he rose, a\r\n\r\n      messenger arrived. There was still another letter for Joseph Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n      This time it was from Natacha, who wrote him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGeneral Trebassof and my step-mother will be very happy to have you come\r\n\r\n      to dinner to-day. As for myself, monsieur, you will pardon me the order\r\n\r\n      which has closed to you for a number of days a dwelling where you have\r\n\r\n      rendered services which I shall not forget all my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The letter ended with a vague polite formula. With the letter in his hand\r\n\r\n      the reporter sat in thought. He seemed to be asking himself, \u201cIs it fish\r\n\r\n      or flesh?\u201d Was it a letter of thanks or of menace? That was what he could\r\n\r\n      not decide. Well, he would soon know, for he had decided to accept that\r\n\r\n      invitation. Anything that brought him and Natacha into communication at\r\n\r\n      the moment was a thing of capital importance to him. Half-an-hour later he\r\n\r\n      gave the address of the villa to an isvotchick, and soon he stepped out\r\n\r\n      before the gate where Ermolai seemed to be waiting for him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was so occupied by thought of the conversation he was going\r\n\r\n      to have with Natacha that he had completely forgotten the excellent\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Gounsovski and his invitation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter found Koupriane\u2019s agents making a close-linked chain around\r\n\r\n      the grounds and each watching the other. Matrena had not wished any agent\r\n\r\n      to be in house. He showed Koupriane\u2019s pass and entered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai ushered Rouletabille in with shining face. He seemed glad to have\r\n\r\n      him there again. He bowed low before him and uttered many compliments, of\r\n\r\n      which the reporter did not understand a word. Rouletabille passed on,\r\n\r\n      entered the garden and saw Matrena Petrovna there walking with her\r\n\r\n      step-daughter. They seemed on the best of terms with each other. The\r\n\r\n      grounds wore an air of tranquillity and the residents seemed to have\r\n\r\n      totally forgotten the somber tragedy of the other night. Matrena and\r\n\r\n      Natacha came smilingly up to the young man, who inquired after the\r\n\r\n      general. They both turned and pointed out Feodor Feodorovitch, who waved\r\n\r\n      to him from the height of the kiosk, where it seemed the table had been\r\n\r\n      spread. They were going to dine out of doors this fine night.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything goes very well, very well indeed, dear little domovoi,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Matrena. \u201cHow glad it is to see you and thank you. If you only knew how I\r\n\r\n      suffered in your absence, I who know how unjust my daughter was to you.\r\n\r\n      But dear Natacha knows now what she owes you. She doesn\u2019t doubt your word\r\n\r\n      now, nor your clear intelligence, little angel. Michael Nikolaievitch was\r\n\r\n      a monster and he was punished as he deserved. You know the police have\r\n\r\n      proof now that he was one of the Central Revolutionary Committee\u2019s most\r\n\r\n      dangerous agents. And he an officer! Whom can we trust now!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd Monsieur Boris Mourazoff, have you seen him since?\u201d inquired\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBoris called to see us to-day, to say good-by, but we did not receive\r\n\r\n      him, under the orders of the police. Natacha has written to tell him of\r\n\r\n      Koupriane\u2019s orders. We have received letters from him; he is quitting St.\r\n\r\n      Petersburg.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat for?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, after the frightful bloody scene in his little house, when he\r\n\r\n      learned how Michael Nikolaievitch had found his death, and after he\r\n\r\n      himself had undergone a severe grilling from the police, and when he\r\n\r\n      learned the police had sacked his library and gone through his papers, he\r\n\r\n      resigned, and has resolved to live from now on out in the country, without\r\n\r\n      seeing anyone, like the philosopher and poet he is. So far as I am\r\n\r\n      concerned, I think he is doing absolutely right. When a young man is a\r\n\r\n      poet, it is useless to live like a soldier. Someone has said that, I don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      know the name now, and when one has ideas that may upset other people,\r\n\r\n      surely they ought to live in solitude.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at Natacha, who was as pale as her white gown, and who\r\n\r\n      added no word to her mother\u2019s outburst. They had drawn near the kiosk.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille saluted the general, who called to him to come up and, when\r\n\r\n      the young man extended his hand, he drew him abruptly nearer and embraced\r\n\r\n      him. To show Rouletabille how active he was getting again, Feodor\r\n\r\n      Feodorovitch marched up and down the kiosk with only the aid of a stick.\r\n\r\n      He went and came with a sort of wild, furious gayety.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey haven\u2019t got me yet, the dogs. They haven\u2019t got me! And one (he was\r\n\r\n      thinking of Michael) who saw me every day was here just for that. Very\r\n\r\n      well. I ask you where he is now. And yet here I am! An attack! I\u2019m always\r\n\r\n      here! But with a good eye; and I begin to have a good leg. We shall see.\r\n\r\n      Why, I recollect how, when I was at Tiflis, there was an insurrection in\r\n\r\n      the Caucasus. We fought. Several times I could feel the swish of bullets\r\n\r\n      past my hair. My comrades fell around me like flies. But nothing happened\r\n\r\n      to me, not a thing. And here now! They will not get me, they will not get\r\n\r\n      me. You know how they plan now to come to me, as living bombs. Yes, they\r\n\r\n      have decided on that. I can\u2019t press a friend\u2019s hand any more without the\r\n\r\n      fear of seeing him explode. What do you think of that? But they won\u2019t get\r\n\r\n      me. Come, drink my health. A small glass of vodka for an appetizer. You\r\n\r\n      see, young man, we are going to have zakouskis here. What a marvelous\r\n\r\n      panorama! You can see everything from here. If the enemy comes,\u201d he added\r\n\r\n      with a singular loud laugh, \u201cwe can\u2019t fail to detect him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Certainly the kiosk did rise high above the garden and was completely\r\n\r\n      detached, no wall being near. They had a clear view. No branches of trees\r\n\r\n      hung over the roof and no tree hid the view. The rustic table of rough\r\n\r\n      wood was covered with a short cloth and was spread with zakouskis. It was\r\n\r\n      a meal under the open sky, a seat and a glass in the clear azure. The\r\n\r\n      evening could not have been softer and clearer. And, as the general felt\r\n\r\n      so gay, the repast would have promised to be most agreeable, if\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had not noticed that Matrena Petrovna and Natacha were uneasy\r\n\r\n      and downcast. The reporter soon saw, too, that all the general\u2019s joviality\r\n\r\n      was a little excessive. Anyone would have said that Feodor Feodorovitch\r\n\r\n      spoke to distract himself, to keep himself from thinking. There was\r\n\r\n      sufficient excuse for him after the outrageous drama of the other night.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille noticed further that the general never looked at his\r\n\r\n      daughter, even when he spoke to her. There was too formidable a mystery\r\n\r\n      lying between them for restraint not to increase day by day. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      involuntarily shook his head, saddened by all he saw. His movement was\r\n\r\n      surprised by Matrena Petrovna, who pressed his hand in silence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, now,\u201d said the general, \u201cwell, now my children, where is the\r\n\r\n      vodka?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Among all the bottles which graced the table the general looked in vain\r\n\r\n      for his flask of vodka. How in the world could he dine if he did not\r\n\r\n      prepare for that important act by the rapid absorption of two or three\r\n\r\n      little glasses of white wine, between two or three sandwiches of caviare!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cErmolai must have left it in the wine-chest,\u201d said Matrena.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The wine-closet was in the dining-room. She rose to go there, but Natacha\r\n\r\n      hurried before her down the little flight of steps, crying, \u201cStay there,\r\n\r\n      mamma. I will go.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t you bother, either. I know where it is,\u201d cried Rouletabille, and\r\n\r\n      hurried after Natacha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She did not stop. The two young people arrived in the dining-room at the\r\n\r\n      same time. They were there alone, as Rouletabille had foreseen. He stopped\r\n\r\n      Natacha and planted himself in front of her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, mademoiselle, did you not answer me earlier?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I don\u2019t wish to have any conversation with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf that was so, you would not have come here, where you were sure I would\r\n\r\n      follow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She hesitated, with an emotion that would have been incomprehensible to\r\n\r\n      all others perhaps, but was not to Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, yes, I wished to say this to you: Don\u2019t write to me any more. Don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      speak to me. Don\u2019t see me. Go away from here, monsieur; go away. They will\r\n\r\n      have your life. And if you have found out anything, forget it. Ah, on the\r\n\r\n      head of your mother, forget it, or you are lost. That is what I wished to\r\n\r\n      tell you. And now, you go.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She grasped his hand in a quick sympathetic movement that she seemed\r\n\r\n      instantly to regret.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou go away,\u201d she repeated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille still held his place before her. She turned from him; she did\r\n\r\n      not wish to hear anything further.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are watched closer than ever. Who will take\r\n\r\n      Michael Nikolaievitch\u2019s place?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadman, be silent! Hush!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He said this with such simple bravery that tears sprang to her eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDear man! Poor man! Dear brave man!\u201d She did not know what to say. Her\r\n\r\n      emotion checked all utterance. But it was necessary for her to enable him\r\n\r\n      to understand that there was nothing he could do to help her in her sad\r\n\r\n      straits.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo. If they knew what you have just said, what you have proposed now, you\r\n\r\n      would be dead to-morrow. Don\u2019t let them suspect. And above all, don\u2019t try\r\n\r\n      to see me anywhere. Go back to papa at once. We have been here too long.\r\n\r\n      What if they learn of it?\u2014and they learn everything! They are\r\n\r\n      everywhere, and have ears everywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle, just one word more, a single word. Do you doubt now that\r\n\r\n      Michael tried to poison your father?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, I wish to believe it. I wish to. I wish to believe it for your sake,\r\n\r\n      my poor boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille desired something besides \u201cI wish to believe it for your\r\n\r\n      sake, my poor boy.\u201d He was far from being satisfied. She saw him turn\r\n\r\n      pale. She tried to reassure him while her trembling hands raised the lid\r\n\r\n      of the wine-chest.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat makes me think you are right is that I have decided myself that only\r\n\r\n      one and the same person, as you said, climbed to the window of the little\r\n\r\n      balcony. Yes, no one can doubt that, and you have reasoned well.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But he persisted still.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd yet, in spite of that, you are not entirely sure, since you say, \u2018I\r\n\r\n      wish to believe it, my poor boy.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Rouletabille, someone might have tried to poison my father, and\r\n\r\n      not have come by way of the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, that is impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing is impossible to them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And she turned her head away again.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, why,\u201d she said, with her voice entirely changed and quite\r\n\r\n      indifferent, as if she wished to be merely \u2018the daughter of the house\u2019 in\r\n\r\n      conversation with the young man, \u201cthe vodka is not in the wine chest,\r\n\r\n      after all. What has Ermolai done with it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She ran over to the buffet and found the flask.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, here it is. Papa shan\u2019t be without it, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was already into the garden again.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf that is the only doubt she has,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cI can reassure\r\n\r\n      her. No one could come, excepting by the window. And only one came that\r\n\r\n      way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The young girl had rejoined him, bringing the flask. They crossed the\r\n\r\n      garden together to the general, who was whiling away the time as he waited\r\n\r\n      for his vodka explaining to Matrena Petrovna the nature of \u201cthe\r\n\r\n      constitution.\u201d He had spilt a box of matches on the table and arranged\r\n\r\n      them carefully.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere,\u201d he cried to Natacha and Rouletabille. \u201cCome here and I will\r\n\r\n      explain to you as well what this Constitution amounts to.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The young people leaned over his demonstration curiously and all eyes in\r\n\r\n      the kiosk were intent on the matches.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou see that match,\u201d said Feodor Feodorovitch. \u201cIt is the Emperor. And\r\n\r\n      this other match is the Empress; this one is the Tsarevitch; and that one\r\n\r\n      is the Grand-duke Alexander; and these are the other granddukes. Now, here\r\n\r\n      are the ministers and there the principal governors, and then the\r\n\r\n      generals; these here are the bishops.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The whole box of matches was used up, and each match was in its place, as\r\n\r\n      is the way in an empire where proper etiquette prevails in government and\r\n\r\n      the social order.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d continued the general, \u201cdo you want to know, Matrena Petrovna,\r\n\r\n      what a constitution is? There! That is the Constitution.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The general, with a swoop of his hand, mixed all the matches. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      laughed, but the good Matrena said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t understand, Feodor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFind the Emperor now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then Matrena understood. She laughed heartily, she laughed violently, and\r\n\r\n      Natacha laughed also. Delighted with his success, Feodor Feodorovitch took\r\n\r\n      up one of the little glasses that Natacha had filled with the vodka she\r\n\r\n      brought.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen, my children,\u201d said he. \u201cWe are going to commence the zakouskis.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane ought to have been here before this.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Saying this, holding still the little glass in his hand, he felt in his\r\n\r\n      pocket with the other for his watch, and drew out a magnificent large\r\n\r\n      watch whose ticking was easily heard.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, the watch has come back from the repairer,\u201d Rouletabille remarked\r\n\r\n      smilingly to Matrena Petrovna. \u201cIt looks like a splendid one.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt has very fine works,\u201d said the general. \u201cIt was bequeathed to me by my\r\n\r\n      grandfather. It marks the seconds, and the phases of the moon, and sounds\r\n\r\n      the hours and half-hours.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille bent over the watch, admiring it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou expect M. Koupriane for dinner?\u201d inquired the young man, still\r\n\r\n      examining the watch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, but since he is so late, we\u2019ll not delay any longer. Your healths,\r\n\r\n      my children,\u201d said the general as Rouletabille handed him back the watch\r\n\r\n      and he put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour health, Feodor Feodorovitch,\u201d replied Matrena Petrovna, with her\r\n\r\n      usual tenderness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and Natacha only touched their lips to the vodka, but Feodor\r\n\r\n      Feodorovitch and Matrena drank theirs in the Russian fashion, head back\r\n\r\n      and all at a draught, draining it to the bottom and flinging the contents\r\n\r\n      to the back of the throat. They had no more than performed this gesture\r\n\r\n      when the general uttered an oath and tried to expel what he had drained so\r\n\r\n      heartily. Matrena Petrovna spat violently also, looking with horror at her\r\n\r\n      husband.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it? What has someone put in the vodka?\u201d cried Feodor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat has someone put in the vodka?\u201d repeated Matrena Petrovna in a thick\r\n\r\n      voice, her eyes almost starting from her head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The two young people threw themselves upon the unfortunates. Feodor\u2019s face\r\n\r\n      had an expression of atrocious suffering.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are poisoned,\u201d cried the general, in the midst of his chokings. \u201cI am\r\n\r\n      burning inside.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Almost mad, Natacha took her father\u2019s head in her hands. She cried to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVomit, papa; vomit!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must find an emetic,\u201d cried Rouletabille, holding on to the general,\r\n\r\n      who had almost slipped from his arms.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna, whose gagging noises were violent, hurried down the\r\n\r\n      steps of the kiosk, crossed the garden as though wild-fire were behind\r\n\r\n      her, and bounded into the veranda. During this time the general succeeded\r\n\r\n      in easing himself, thanks to Rouletabille, who had thrust a spoon to the\r\n\r\n      root of his tongue. Natacha could do nothing but cry, \u201cMy God, my God, my\r\n\r\n      God!\u201d Feodor held onto his stomach, still crying, \u201cI\u2019m burning, I\u2019m\r\n\r\n      burning!\u201d The scene was frightfully tragic and funny at the same time. To\r\n\r\n      add to the burlesque, the general\u2019s watch in his pocket struck eight\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock. Feodor Feodorovitch stood up in a final supreme effort. \u201cOh, it\r\n\r\n      is horrible!\u201d Matrena Petrovna showed a red, almost violet face as she\r\n\r\n      came back; she distorted it, she choked, her mouth twitched, but she\r\n\r\n      brought something, a little packet that she waved, and from which,\r\n\r\n      trembling frightenedly, she shook a powder into the first two empty\r\n\r\n      glasses, which were on her side of the table and were those she and the\r\n\r\n      general had drained. She still had strength to fill them with water, while\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was almost overcome by the general, whom he still had in his\r\n\r\n      arms, and Natacha concerned herself with nothing but her father, leaning\r\n\r\n      over him as though to follow the progress of the terrible poison, to read\r\n\r\n      in his eyes if it was to be life or death. \u201cIpecac,\u201d cried Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna, and she made the general drink it. She did not drink until after\r\n\r\n      him. The heroic woman must have exerted superhuman force to go herself to\r\n\r\n      find the saving antidote in her medicine-chest, even while the agony\r\n\r\n      pervaded her vitals.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Some minutes later both could be considered saved. The servants, Ermolai\r\n\r\n      at their head, were clustered about. Most of them had been at the lodge\r\n\r\n      and they had not, it appeared, heard the beginning of the affair, the\r\n\r\n      cries of Natacha and Rouletabille. Koupriane arrived just then. It was he\r\n\r\n      who worked with Natacha in getting the two to bed. Then he directed one of\r\n\r\n      his agents to go for the nearest doctors they could find.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This done, the Prefect of Police went toward the kiosk where he had left\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille. But Rouletabille was not to be found, and the flask of vodka\r\n\r\n      and the glasses from which they had drunk were gone also. Ermolai was\r\n\r\n      near-by, and he inquired of the servant for the young Frenchman. Ermolai\r\n\r\n      replied that he had just gone away, carrying the flask and the glasses.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane swore. He shook Ermolai and even started to give him a blow with\r\n\r\n      the fist for permitting such a thing to happen before his eyes without\r\n\r\n      making a protest.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai, who had his own haughtiness, dodged Koupriane\u2019s fist and replied\r\n\r\n      that he had wished to prevent the young Frenchman, but the reporter had\r\n\r\n      shown him a police-paper on which Koupriane himself had declared in\r\n\r\n      advance that the young Frenchman was to do anything he pleased.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XII. PERE ALEXIS\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane jumped into his carriage and hurried toward St. Petersburg. On\r\n\r\n      the way he spoke to three agents who only he knew were posted in the\r\n\r\n      neighborhood of Eliaguine. They told him the route Rouletabille had taken.\r\n\r\n      The reporter had certainly returned into the city. He hurried toward\r\n\r\n      Troitski Bridge. There, at the corner of the Naberjnaia, Koupriane saw the\r\n\r\n      reporter in a hired conveyance. Rouletabille was pounding his coachman in\r\n\r\n      the back, Russian fashion, to make him go faster, and was calling with all\r\n\r\n      his strength one of the few words he had had time to learn, \u201cNaleva,\r\n\r\n      naleva\u201d (to the left). The driver was forced to understand at last, for\r\n\r\n      there was no other way to turn than to the left. If he had turned to the\r\n\r\n      right (naprava) he would have driven into the river. The conveyance\r\n\r\n      clattered over the pointed flints of a neighborhood that led to a little\r\n\r\n      street, Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, at the corner of the Katharine canal. This\r\n\r\n      \u201calley of the pharmacists\u201d as a matter of fact contained no pharmacists,\r\n\r\n      but there was a curious sign of a herbarium, where Rouletabille made the\r\n\r\n      driver stop. As the carriage rolled under the arch Rouletabille recognized\r\n\r\n      Koupriane. He did not wait, but cried to him, \u201cAh, here you are. All\r\n\r\n      right; follow me.\u201d He still had the flask and the glasses in his hands.\r\n\r\n      Koupriane couldn\u2019t help noticing how strange he looked. He passed through\r\n\r\n      a court with him, and into a squalid shop.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat,\u201d said Koupriane, \u201cdo you know Pere Alexis?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They were in the midst of a curious litter. Clusters of dried herbs hung\r\n\r\n      from the ceiling, and all among them were clumps of old boots, shriveled\r\n\r\n      skins, battered pans, scrap-iron, sheep-skins, useless touloupes, and on\r\n\r\n      the floor musty old clothes, moth-eaten furs, and sheep-skin coats that\r\n\r\n      even a moujik of the swamps would not have deigned to wear. Here and there\r\n\r\n      were old teeth, ragged finery, dilapidated hats, and jars of strange herbs\r\n\r\n      ranged upon some rickety shelving. Between the set of scales on the\r\n\r\n      counter and a heap of little blocks of wood used for figuring the accounts\r\n\r\n      of this singular business were ungilded ikons, oxidized silver crosses,\r\n\r\n      and Byzantine pictures representing scenes from the Old and New\r\n\r\n      Testaments. Jars of alcohol with what seemed to be the skeletons of frogs\r\n\r\n      swimming in them filled what space was left. In a corner of this large,\r\n\r\n      murky room, under the vault of mossed stone, a small altar stood and the\r\n\r\n      light burned in a hanging glass of oil before the holy images. A man was\r\n\r\n      praying before the altar. He wore the costume of old Russia, the caftan of\r\n\r\n      green cloth, buttoned at the shoulder and tucked in at the waist by a\r\n\r\n      narrow belt. He had a bushy beard and his hair fell to his shoulders. When\r\n\r\n      he had finished his prayer he rose, perceived Rouletabille and came over\r\n\r\n      to take his hand. He spoke French to the reporter:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, here you are again, lad. Do you bring poison again to-day? This\r\n\r\n      will end by being found out, and the police...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Just then he discerned Koupriane\u2019s form in the shadow, drew close to make\r\n\r\n      out who it was, and fell to his knees as he saw who it was. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      tried to raise him, but he insisted on prostrating himself. He was sure\r\n\r\n      the Prefect of Police had come to his house to hang him. Finally he was\r\n\r\n      reassured by Rouletabille\u2019s positive assertions and the great chief\u2019s\r\n\r\n      robust laugh. The Prefect wished to know how the young man came to be\r\n\r\n      acquainted with the \u201calchemist\u201d of the police. Rouletabille told him in a\r\n\r\n      few words.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Maitre Alexis, in his youth, went to France afoot, to study pharmacy,\r\n\r\n      because of his enthusiasm for chemistry. But he always remained\r\n\r\n      countrified, very much a Russian peasant, a semi-Oriental bear, and did\r\n\r\n      not achieve his degree. He took some certificates, but the examinations\r\n\r\n      were too much for him. For fifty years he lived miserably as a\r\n\r\n      pharmacist\u2019s assistant in the back of a disreputable shop in the Notre\r\n\r\n      Dame quarter. The proprietor of the place was implicated in the famous\r\n\r\n      affair of the gold ingots, which started Rouletabille\u2019s reputation, and\r\n\r\n      was arrested along with his assistant, Alexis. It was Rouletabille who\r\n\r\n      proved, clear as day, that poor Alexis was innocent, and that he had never\r\n\r\n      been cognizant of his master\u2019s evil ways, being absorbed in the depths of\r\n\r\n      his laboratory in trying to work out a naive alchemy which fascinated him,\r\n\r\n      though the world of chemistry had passed it by centuries ago. At the trial\r\n\r\n      Alexis was acquitted, but found himself in the street. He shed what tears\r\n\r\n      remained in his body upon the neck of the reporter, assuring him of\r\n\r\n      paradise if he got him back to his own country, because he desired only\r\n\r\n      the one thing more of life, that he might see his birth-land before he\r\n\r\n      died. Rouletabille advanced the necessary means and sent him to St.\r\n\r\n      Petersburg. There he was picked up at the end of two days by the police,\r\n\r\n      in a petty gambling-game, and thrown into prison, where he promptly had a\r\n\r\n      chance to show his talents. He cured some of his companions in misery, and\r\n\r\n      even some of the guards. A guard who had an injured leg, whose healing he\r\n\r\n      had despaired of, was cured by Alexis. Then there was found to be no\r\n\r\n      actual charge against him. They set him free and, moreover, they\r\n\r\n      interested themselves in him. They found meager employment for him in the\r\n\r\n      Stchoukine-dvor, an immense popular bazaar. He accumulated a few roubles\r\n\r\n      and installed himself on his own account at the back of a court in the\r\n\r\n      Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, where he gradually piled up a heap of old odds and\r\n\r\n      ends that no one wanted even in the Stchoukine-dvor. But he was happy,\r\n\r\n      because behind his shop he had installed a little laboratory where he\r\n\r\n      continued for his pleasure his experiments in alchemy and his study of\r\n\r\n      plants. He still proposed to write a book that he had already spoken of in\r\n\r\n      France to Rouletabille, to prove the truth of \u201cEmpiric Treatment of\r\n\r\n      Medicinal Herbs, the Science of Alchemy, and the Ancient Experiments in\r\n\r\n      Sorcery.\u201d Between times he continued to cure anyone who applied to him,\r\n\r\n      and the police in particular. The police guards protected him and used\r\n\r\n      him. He had splendid plasters for them after \u201cthe scandal,\u201d as they called\r\n\r\n      the October riots. So when the doctors of the quarter tried to prosecute\r\n\r\n      him for illegal practice, a deputation of police-guards went to Koupriane,\r\n\r\n      who took the responsibility and discontinued proceedings against him. They\r\n\r\n      regarded him as under protection of the saints, and Alexis soon came to be\r\n\r\n      regarded himself as something of a holy man. He never failed every\r\n\r\n      Christmas and Easter to send his finest images to Rouletabille, wishing\r\n\r\n      him all prosperity and saying that if ever he came to St. Petersburg he\r\n\r\n      should be happy to receive him at Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, where he was\r\n\r\n      established in honest labor. Pere Alexis, like all the true saints, was a\r\n\r\n      modest man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When Alexis had recovered a little from his emotion Rouletabille said to\r\n\r\n      him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPere Alexis, I do bring you poison again, but you have nothing to fear,\r\n\r\n      for His Excellency the Chief of Police is with me. Here is what we want\r\n\r\n      you to do. You must tell us what poison these four glasses have held, and\r\n\r\n      what poison is still in this flask and this little phial.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is that little phial?\u201d demanded Koupriane, as he saw Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      pull a small, stoppered bottle out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter replied, \u201cI have put into this bottle the vodka that was\r\n\r\n      poured into Natacha\u2019s glass and mine and that we barely touched.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSomeone has tried to poison you!\u201d exclaimed Pere Alexis.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, not me,\u201d replied Rouletabille, in bored fashion. \u201cDon\u2019t think about\r\n\r\n      that. Simply do what I tell you. Then analyze these two napkins, as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he drew from his coat two soiled napkins.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d said Koupriane, \u201cyou have thought of everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are the napkins the general and his wife used.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, I understand that,\u201d said the Chief of Police.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you, Alexis, do you understand?\u201d asked the reporter. \u201cWhen can we\r\n\r\n      have the result of your analysis?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn an hour, at the latest.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d said Koupriane. \u201cNow I need not tell you to hold your tongue.\r\n\r\n      I am going to leave one of my men here. You will write us a note that you\r\n\r\n      will seal, and he will bring it to head-quarters. Sure you understand? In\r\n\r\n      an hour?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn an hour, Excellency.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They went out, and Alexis followed them, bowing to the floor. Koupriane\r\n\r\n      had Rouletabille get into his carriage. The young man did as he was told.\r\n\r\n      One would have said he did not know where he was or what he did. He made\r\n\r\n      no reply to the chief\u2019s questions.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis Pere Alexander,\u201d resumed Koupriane, \u201cis a character, really quite a\r\n\r\n      figure. And a bit of a schemer, I should say. He has seen how Father John\r\n\r\n      of Cronstadt succeeded, and he says to himself, \u2018Since the sailors had\r\n\r\n      their Father John of Cronstadt, why shouldn\u2019t the police-guard have their\r\n\r\n      Father Alexis of Aptiekarski-Pereoulok?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Rouletabille did not reply at all, and Koupriane wound up by demanding\r\n\r\n      what was the matter with him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe matter is,\u201d replied Rouletabille, unable longer to conceal his\r\n\r\n      anguish, \u201cthat the poison continues.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoes that astonish you?\u201d returned Koupriane. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at him and shook his head. His lips trembled as he\r\n\r\n      said, \u201cI know what you think. It is abominable. But the thing I have done\r\n\r\n      certainly is more abominable still.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat have you done, then, Monsieur Rouletabille?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps I have caused the death of an innocent man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo long as you aren\u2019t sure of it, you would better not fret about it, my\r\n\r\n      dear friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is enough that the doubt has arisen,\u201d said the reporter, \u201calmost to\r\n\r\n      kill me;\u201d and he heaved so gloomy a sigh that the excellent Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Koupriane felt pity for the lad. He tapped him on the knee.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome, come, young man, you ought to know one thing by this time\u2014\u2018you\r\n\r\n      can\u2019t make omelettes without breaking eggs,\u2019 as they say, I think, in\r\n\r\n      Paris.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille turned away from him with horror in his heart. If there\r\n\r\n      should be another, someone besides Michael! If it was another hand than\r\n\r\n      his that appeared to Matrena and him in the mysterious night! If Michael\r\n\r\n      Nikolaievitch had been innocent! Well, he would kill himself, that was\r\n\r\n      all. And those horrible words that he had exchanged with Natacha rose in\r\n\r\n      his memory, singing in his ears as though they would deafen him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you doubt still?\u201d he had asked her, \u201cthat Michael tried to poison your\r\n\r\n      father?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Natacha had replied, \u201cI wish to believe it! I wish to believe it, for\r\n\r\n      your sake, my poor boy.\u201d And then he recalled her other words, still more\r\n\r\n      frightful now! \u201cCouldn\u2019t someone have tried to poison my father and not\r\n\r\n      have come by the window?\u201d He had faced such a hypothesis with assurance\r\n\r\n      then\u2014but now, now that the poison continued, continued within the\r\n\r\n      house, where he believed himself so fully aware of all people and things\u2014continued\r\n\r\n      now that Michael Nikolaievitch was dead\u2014ah, where did it come from,\r\n\r\n      this poison?\u2014and what was it? Pere Alexis would hurry his analysis\r\n\r\n      if he had any regard for poor Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      For Rouletabille to doubt, and in an affair where already there was one\r\n\r\n      man dead through his agency, was torment worse than death.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When they arrived at police-headquarters, Rouletabille jumped from\r\n\r\n      Koupriane\u2019s carriage and without saying a word hailed an empty isvotchick\r\n\r\n      that was passing. He had himself driven back to Pere Alexis. His doubt\r\n\r\n      mastered his will; he could not bear to wait away. Under the arch of\r\n\r\n      Aptiekarski-Pereoulok he saw once more the man Koupriane had placed there\r\n\r\n      with the order to bring him Alexis\u2019s message. The man looked at him in\r\n\r\n      astonishment. Rouletabille crossed the court and entered the dingy old\r\n\r\n      room once more. Pere Alexis was not there, naturally, engaged as he was in\r\n\r\n      his laboratory. But a person whom he did not recognize at first sight\r\n\r\n      attracted the reporter\u2019s attention. In the half-light of the shop a\r\n\r\n      melancholy shadow leaned over the ikons on the counter. It was only when\r\n\r\n      he straightened up, with a deep sigh, and a little light, deflected and\r\n\r\n      yellow from passing through window-panes that had known no touch of\r\n\r\n      cleaning since they were placed there, fell faintly on the face, that\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille ascertained he was face to face with Boris Mourazoff. It was\r\n\r\n      indeed he, the erstwhile brilliant officer whose elegance and charm the\r\n\r\n      reporter had admired as he saw him at beautiful Natacha\u2019s feet in the\r\n\r\n      datcha at Eliaguine. Now, no more in uniform, he had thrown over his bowed\r\n\r\n      shoulders a wretched coat, whose sleeves swayed listlessly at his sides,\r\n\r\n      in accord with his mood of languid desperation, a felt hat with the rim\r\n\r\n      turned down hid a little the misery in his face in these few days, these\r\n\r\n      not-many hours, how he was changed! But, even as he was, he still\r\n\r\n      concerned Rouletabille. What was he doing there? Was he not going to go\r\n\r\n      away, perhaps? He had picked up an ikon from the counter and carried it\r\n\r\n      over to the window to examine its oxidized silver, giving such close\r\n\r\n      attention to it that the reporter hoped he might reach the door of the\r\n\r\n      laboratory without being noticed. He already had his hand on the knob of\r\n\r\n      that door, which was behind the counter, when he heard his name called.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is you, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d said the low, sad voice of Boris.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat has brought you here, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, well, Monsieur Boris Mourazoff, unless I\u2019m mistaken? I certainly\r\n\r\n      didn\u2019t expect to find you here in Pere Alexis\u2019s place.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy not, Monsieur Rouletabille? One can find anything here in Pere\r\n\r\n      Alexis\u2019s stock. See; here are two old ikons in wood, carved with\r\n\r\n      sculptures, which came direct from Athos, and can\u2019t be equaled, I assure\r\n\r\n      you, either at Gastini-Dvor nor even at Stchoukine-Dvor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, that is possible,\u201d said Rouletabille, impatiently. \u201cAre you an\r\n\r\n      amateur of such things?\u201d he added, in order to say something.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, like anybody else. But I was going to tell you, Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, I have resigned my commission. I have resolved to retire\r\n\r\n      from the world; I am going on a long voyage.\u201d (Rouletabille thought: \u2018Why\r\n\r\n      not have gone at once?\u2019) \u201cAnd before going, I have come here to supply\r\n\r\n      myself with some little gifts to send those of my friends I particularly\r\n\r\n      care for, although now, my dear Monsieur Rouletabille, I don\u2019t care much\r\n\r\n      for anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou look desolate enough, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Boris sighed like a child.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow could it be otherwise?\u201d he said. \u201cI loved and believed myself\r\n\r\n      beloved. But it proved to be\u2014nothing, alas!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSometimes one only imagines things,\u201d said Rouletabille, keeping his hand\r\n\r\n      on the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said the other, growing more and more melancholy. \u201cSo a man\r\n\r\n      suffers. He is his own tormentor; he himself makes the wheel on which,\r\n\r\n      like his own executioner, he binds himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is not necessary, monsieur; it is not necessary,\u201d counseled the\r\n\r\n      reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen,\u201d implored Boris in a voice that showed tears were not far away.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are still a child, but still you can see things. Do you believe\r\n\r\n      Natacha loves me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure of it, Monsieur Boris; I am sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure of it, too. But I don\u2019t know what to think now. She has let me\r\n\r\n      go, without trying to detain me, without a word of hope.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd where are you going like that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am returning to the Orel country, where I first saw her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is good, very good, Monsieur Boris. At least there you are sure to\r\n\r\n      see her again. She goes there every year with her parents for a few weeks.\r\n\r\n      It is a detail you haven\u2019t overlooked, doubtless.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly I haven\u2019t. I will tell you that that prospect decided my place\r\n\r\n      of retreat.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSee!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGod gives me nothing, but He opens His treasures, and each takes what he\r\n\r\n      can.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes; and Mademoiselle Natacha, does she know it is to Orel you have\r\n\r\n      decided to retire?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no reason for concealing it from her, Monsieur Rouletabille.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo far so good. You needn\u2019t feel so desolate, my dear Monsieur Boris. All\r\n\r\n      is not lost. I will say even that I see a future for you full of hope.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, if you are able to say that truthfully, I am happy indeed to have met\r\n\r\n      you. I will never forget this rope you have flung me when all the waters\r\n\r\n      seemed closing over my head. \u2018What do you advise, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI advise you to go to Orel, monsieur, and as quickly as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well. You must have reasons for saying that. I obey you, monsieur,\r\n\r\n      and go.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As Boris started towards the entrance-arch, Rouletabille slipped into the\r\n\r\n      laboratory. Old Alexis was bent over his retorts. A wretched lamp barely\r\n\r\n      lighted his obscure work. He turned at the noise the reporter made.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!-you, lad!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, nothing so quick. Still, I have already analyzed the two napkins, you\r\n\r\n      know.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes? The stains? Tell me, for the love of God!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, my boy, it is arsenate of soda again.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, stricken to the heart, uttered a low cry and everything\r\n\r\n      seemed to dance around him. Pere Alexis in the midst of all the strange\r\n\r\n      laboratory instruments seemed Satan himself, and he repulsed the kindly\r\n\r\n      arms stretched forth to sustain him; in the gloom, where danced here and\r\n\r\n      there the little blue flames from the crucibles, lively as flickering\r\n\r\n      tongues, he believed he saw Michael Nikolaievitch\u2019s ghost come to cry,\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe arsenate of soda continues, and I am dead.\u201d He fell against the door,\r\n\r\n      which swung open, and he rolled as far as the counter, and struck his face\r\n\r\n      against it. The shock, that might well have been fatal, brought him out of\r\n\r\n      his intense nightmare and made him instantly himself again. He rose,\r\n\r\n      jumped over the heap of boots and fol-de-rols, and leaped to the court.\r\n\r\n      There Boris grabbed him by his coat. Rouletabille turned, furious:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you want? You haven\u2019t started for the Orel yet?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I am going, but I will be very grateful if you will take these\r\n\r\n      things yourself to\u2014to Natacha.\u201d He showed him, still with despairing\r\n\r\n      mien, the two ikons from Mount Athos, and Rouletabille took them from him,\r\n\r\n      thrust them in his pocket, and hurried on, crying, \u201cI understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Outside, Rouletabille tried to get hold of himself, to recover his\r\n\r\n      coolness a little. Was it possible that he had made a mortal error? Alas,\r\n\r\n      alas, how could he doubt it now! The arsenate of soda continued. He made,\r\n\r\n      a superhuman effort to ward off the horror of that, even momentarily\u2014the\r\n\r\n      death of innocent Michael Nikolaievitch\u2014and to think of nothing\r\n\r\n      except the immediate consequences, which must be carefully considered if\r\n\r\n      he wished to avoid some new catastrophe. Ah, the assassin was not\r\n\r\n      discouraged. And that time, what a piece of work he had tried! What a\r\n\r\n      hecatomb if he had succeeded! The general, Matrena Petrovna, Natacha and\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille himself (who almost regretted, so far as he was concerned,\r\n\r\n      that it had not succeeded)\u2014and Koupriane! Koupriane, who should have\r\n\r\n      been there for luncheon. What a bag for the Nihilists! That was it, that\r\n\r\n      was it. Rouletabille understood now why they had not hesitated to poison\r\n\r\n      everybody at once: Koupriane was among them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Michael Nikolaievitch would have been avenged!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The attempt had failed this time, but what might they not expect now! From\r\n\r\n      the moment he believed Michael Nikolaievitch no longer guilty, as he had\r\n\r\n      imagined, Rouletabille fell into a bottomless abyss.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Where should he go? After a few moments he made the circuit of the\r\n\r\n      Rotunda, which serves as the market for this quarter and is the finest\r\n\r\n      ornament of Aptiekarski-Pereoulok. He made the circuit without knowing it,\r\n\r\n      without stopping for anything, without seeing or understanding anything.\r\n\r\n      As a broken-winded horse makes its way in the treadmill, so he walked\r\n\r\n      around with the thought that he also was lost in a treadmill that led him\r\n\r\n      nowhere. Rouletabille was no longer Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XIII. THE LIVING BOMBS\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At random\u2014because now he could only act at random\u2014he returned\r\n\r\n      to the datcha. Great disorder reigned there. The guard had been doubled.\r\n\r\n      The general\u2019s friends, summoned by Trebassof, surrounded the two poisoned\r\n\r\n      sufferers and filled the house with their bustling devotion and their\r\n\r\n      protestations of affection. However, an insignificant doctor from the\r\n\r\n      common quarter of the Vasili-Ostrow, brought by the police, reassured\r\n\r\n      everybody. The police had not found the general\u2019s household physician at\r\n\r\n      home, but promised the immediate arrival of two specialists, whom they had\r\n\r\n      found instead. In the meantime they had picked up on the way this little\r\n\r\n      doctor, who was gay and talkative as a magpie. He had enough to do looking\r\n\r\n      after Matrena Petrovna, who had been so sick that her husband, Feodor\r\n\r\n      Feodorovitch, still trembled, \u201cfor the first time in his life,\u201d as the\r\n\r\n      excellent Ivan Petrovitch said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter was astonished at not finding Natacha either in Matrena\u2019s\r\n\r\n      apartment or Feodor\u2019s. He asked Matrena where her step-daughter was.\r\n\r\n      Matrena turned a frightened face toward him. When they were alone, she\r\n\r\n      said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe do not know where she is. Almost as soon as you left she disappeared,\r\n\r\n      and no one has seen her since. The general has asked for her several\r\n\r\n      times. I have had to tell him Koupriane took her with him to learn the\r\n\r\n      details from her of what happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is not with Koupriane,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere is she? This disappearance is more than strange at the moment we\r\n\r\n      were dying, when her father\u2014O God! Leave me, my child; I am\r\n\r\n      stifling; I am stifling.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille called the temporary doctor and withdrew from the chamber. He\r\n\r\n      had come with the idea of inspecting the house room by room, corner by\r\n\r\n      corner, to make sure whether or not any possibility of entrance existed\r\n\r\n      that he had not noticed before, an entrance would-be poisoners were\r\n\r\n      continuing to use. But now a new fact confronted him and overshadowed\r\n\r\n      everything: the disappearance of Natacha. How he lamented his ignorance of\r\n\r\n      the Russian language\u2014and not one of Koupriane\u2019s men knew French. He\r\n\r\n      might draw something out of Ermolai.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai said he had seen Natacha just outside the gate for a moment,\r\n\r\n      looking up and down the road. Then he had been called to the general, and\r\n\r\n      so knew nothing further.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      That was all the reporter could gather from the gestures rather than the\r\n\r\n      words of the old servant.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      An additional difficulty now was that twilight drew on, and it was\r\n\r\n      impossible for the reporter to discern Natacha\u2019s foot-prints. Was it true\r\n\r\n      that the young girl had fled at such a moment, immediately after the\r\n\r\n      poisoning, before she knew whether her father and mother were entirely out\r\n\r\n      of danger? If Natacha were innocent, as Rouletabille still wished to\r\n\r\n      believe, such an attitude was simply incomprehensible. And the girl could\r\n\r\n      not but be aware she would increase Koupriane\u2019s suspicions. The reporter\r\n\r\n      had a vital reason for seeing her immediately, a vital reason for all\r\n\r\n      concerned, above all in this moment when the Nihilists were culminating\r\n\r\n      their plans, a vital reason for her and for him, equally menaced with\r\n\r\n      death, to talk with her and to renew the propositions he had made a few\r\n\r\n      minutes before the poisoning and which she had not wished to hear him talk\r\n\r\n      about, in fearful pity for him or in defiance of him. Where was Natacha?\r\n\r\n      He thought maybe she was trying to rejoin Annouchka, and there were\r\n\r\n      reasons for that, both if she were innocent and if she were guilty. But\r\n\r\n      where was Annouchka? Who could say! Gounsovski perhaps. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      jumped into an isvo, returning from the Point empty, and gave Gounsovski\u2019s\r\n\r\n      address. He deigned then to recall that he had been invited that same day\r\n\r\n      to dine with the Gounsovskis. They would no longer be expecting him. He\r\n\r\n      blamed himself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They received him, but they had long since finished dinner.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur and Madame Gounsovski were playing a game of draughts under the\r\n\r\n      lamp. Rouletabille as he entered the drawing-room recognized the shining,\r\n\r\n      fattish bald head of the terrible man. Gounsovski came to him, bowing,\r\n\r\n      obsequious, his fat hands held out. He was presented to Madame Gounsovski,\r\n\r\n      who was besprinkled with jewels over her black silk gown. She had a muddy\r\n\r\n      skin and magnificent eyes. She also was tentatively effusive. \u201cWe waited\r\n\r\n      for you, monsieur,\u201d she said, smirking timidly, with the careful charm of\r\n\r\n      a woman a little along in years who relies still on infantine graces. As\r\n\r\n      the recreant young man offered his apologies, \u201cOh, we know you are much\r\n\r\n      occupied, Monsieur Rouletabille. My husband said that to me only a moment\r\n\r\n      ago. But he knew you would come finally. In the end one always accepts my\r\n\r\n      husband\u2019s invitation.\u201d She said this with a fat smile of importance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille turned cold at this last phrase. He felt actual fear in the\r\n\r\n      presence of these two figures, so atrociously commonplace, in their\r\n\r\n      horrible, decent little drawing-room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut you have had rather a bad dinner already, through that dreadful\r\n\r\n      affair at General Trebassof\u2019s. Come into the dining-room.\u201d \u201cAh, so someone\r\n\r\n      has told you?\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cNo, no, thanks; I don\u2019t need anything\r\n\r\n      more. You know what has happened?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you had come to dinner, perhaps nothing would have happened at all,\r\n\r\n      you know,\u201d said Gounsovski tranquilly, seating himself again on the\r\n\r\n      cushions and considering his game of draughts through his glasses.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnyway, congratulations to Koupriane for being away from there through\r\n\r\n      his fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      For Gounsovski there was only Koupriane! The life or death of Trebassof\r\n\r\n      did not occupy his mind. Only the acts and movements of the Prefect of\r\n\r\n      Police had power to move him. He ordered a waiting-maid who glided into\r\n\r\n      the apartment without making more noise than a shadow to bring a small\r\n\r\n      stand loaded with zakouskis and bottles of champagne close to the\r\n\r\n      game-table, and he moved one of his pawns, saying, \u201cYou will permit me?\r\n\r\n      This move is mine. I don\u2019t wish to lose it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille ventured to lay his hand on the oily, hairy fist which\r\n\r\n      extended from a dubious cuff.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is this you tell me? How could you have foreseen it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was easy to foresee everything,\u201d replied Gounsovski, offering cigars,\r\n\r\n      \u201cto foresee everything from the moment Matiew\u2019s place was filled by\r\n\r\n      Priemkof.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d questioned Rouletabille, recalling with some inquietude the sight\r\n\r\n      of the whipping in the guards\u2019 chapel.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, this Priemkof, between ourselves,\u201d (and he bent close to the\r\n\r\n      reporter\u2019s ear) \u201cis no better, as a police-guard for Koupriane than Matiew\r\n\r\n      himself. Very dangerous. So when I learned that he took Matiew\u2019s place at\r\n\r\n      the datcha des Iles, I thought there was sure to be some unfortunate\r\n\r\n      happening. But it was no affair of mine, was it? Koupriane would have been\r\n\r\n      able to say to me, \u2018Mind your own business.\u2019 I had gone far enough in\r\n\r\n      warning him of the \u2018living bombs.\u2019 They had been denounced to us by the\r\n\r\n      same agency that enabled us to seize the two living bombs (women, if you\r\n\r\n      please!) who were going to the military tribunal at Cronstadt after the\r\n\r\n      rebellion in the fleet. Let him recall that. That ought to make him\r\n\r\n      reflect. I am a brave man. I know he speaks ill of me; but I don\u2019t wish\r\n\r\n      him any harm. The interests of the Empire before all else between us! I\r\n\r\n      wouldn\u2019t talk to you as I do if I didn\u2019t know the Tsar honors you with his\r\n\r\n      favor. Then I invited you to dinner. As one dines one talks. But you did\r\n\r\n      not come. And, while you were dining down there and while Priemkof was on\r\n\r\n      guard at the datcha, that annoying affair Madame Gounsovski has spoken\r\n\r\n      about happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had not sat down, in spite of Madame Gounsovski\u2019s\r\n\r\n      insistences. He took the box of cigars brusquely out of the hand of the\r\n\r\n      Chief of the Secret Service, who had continued tendering them, for this\r\n\r\n      detail of hospitality only annoyed his mood, which had been dark enough\r\n\r\n      for hours and was now deepened by what the other had just said. He\r\n\r\n      comprehended only one thing, that a man named Priemkof, whom he had never\r\n\r\n      heard spoken of, as determined as Matiew to destroy the general, had been\r\n\r\n      entrusted by Koupriane with the guard of the datcha des Iles. It was\r\n\r\n      necessary to warn Koupriane instantly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow is it that you have not done so already, yourself, Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski? Why wait to speak about it to me? It is unimaginable.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon, pardon,\u201d said Gounsovski, smiling softly behind his goggles; \u201cit\r\n\r\n      is not the same thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, it is not the same thing,\u201d seconded the lady with the black silk,\r\n\r\n      brilliant jewels and flabby chin. \u201cWe speak here to a friend in the course\r\n\r\n      of dinner-talk, to a friend who is not of the police. We never denounce\r\n\r\n      anybody.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must tell you. But sit down now,\u201d Gounsovski still insisted, lighting\r\n\r\n      his cigar. \u201cBe reasonable. They have just tried to poison him, so they\r\n\r\n      will take time to breathe before they try something else. Then, too, this\r\n\r\n      poison makes me think they may have given up the idea of living bombs.\r\n\r\n      Then, after all, what is to be will be.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u201d approved the ample dame. \u201cThe police never have been able to\r\n\r\n      prevent what was bound to happen. But, speaking of this Priemkof, it\r\n\r\n      remains between us, eh? Between just us?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, we must tell you now,\u201d Gounsovski slipped in softly, \u201cthat it will\r\n\r\n      be much better not to let Koupriane know that you got the information from\r\n\r\n      me. Because then, you understand, he would not believe you; or, rather, he\r\n\r\n      would not believe me. That is why we take these precautions of dining and\r\n\r\n      smoking a cigar. We speak of one thing and another and you do as you\r\n\r\n      please with what we say. But, to make them useful, it is absolutely\r\n\r\n      necessary, I repeat, to be silent about their source.\u201d (As he said that,\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski gave Rouletabille a piercing glance through his goggles, the\r\n\r\n      first time Rouletabille had seen such a look in his eyes. He never would\r\n\r\n      have suspected him capable of such fire.) \u201cPriemkof,\u201d continued Gounsovski\r\n\r\n      in a low voice, using his handkerchief vigorously, \u201cwas employed here in\r\n\r\n      my home and we separated on bad terms, through his fault, it is necessary\r\n\r\n      to say. Then he got into Koupriane\u2019s confidence by saying the worst he\r\n\r\n      could of us, my dear little monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what could he say?\u2014servants\u2019 stories! my dear little monsieur,\u201d\r\n\r\n       repeated the fat dame, and rolled her great magnificent black eyes\r\n\r\n      furiously. \u201cStories that have been treated as they deserved at Court,\r\n\r\n      certainly. Madame Daquin, the wife of His Majesty\u2019s head-cook, whom you\r\n\r\n      certainly know, and the nephew of the second Maid of Honor to the Empress,\r\n\r\n      who stands very well with his aunt, have told us so; servants\u2019 stories\r\n\r\n      that might have ruined us but have not produced any effect on His Majesty,\r\n\r\n      for whom we would give our lives, Christ knows. Well, you understand now\r\n\r\n      that if you were to say to Koupriane, \u2018Gaspadine Gounsovski has spoken ill\r\n\r\n      to me of Priemkof,\u2019 he would not care to hear a word further. Still,\r\n\r\n      Priemkof is in the scheme for the living bombs, that is all I can tell\r\n\r\n      you; at least, he was before the affair of the poisoning. That poisoning\r\n\r\n      is certainly very astonishing, between us. It does not appear to have come\r\n\r\n      from without, whereas the living bombs will have to come from without. And\r\n\r\n      Priemkof is mixed up in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u201d approved Madame Gounsovski again, \u201che is committed to it.\r\n\r\n      There have been stories about him, too. Other people as well as he can\r\n\r\n      tell tales; it isn\u2019t hard to do. He has got to make some showing now if he\r\n\r\n      is to keep in with Annouchka\u2019s clique.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cKoupriane, our dear Koupriane,\u201d interrupted Gounsovski, slightly troubled\r\n\r\n      at hearing his wife pronounce Annouchka\u2019s name, \u201cKoupriane ought to be\r\n\r\n      able to understand that this time Priemkof must bring things off, or he is\r\n\r\n      definitely ruined.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPriemkof knows it well enough,\u201d replied Madame as she re-filled the\r\n\r\n      glasses, \u201cbut Koupriane doesn\u2019t know it; that is all we can tell you. Is\r\n\r\n      it enough? All the rest is mere gossip.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It certainly was enough for Rouletabille; he had had enough of it! This\r\n\r\n      idle gossip and these living bombs! These pinchbecks, these whispering\r\n\r\n      tale-tellers in their bourgeois, countrified setting; these\r\n\r\n      politico-police combinations whose grotesque side was always uppermost;\r\n\r\n      while the terrible side, the Siberian aspect, prisons, black holes,\r\n\r\n      hangings, disappearances, exiles and deaths and martyrdoms remained so\r\n\r\n      jealously hidden that no one ever spoke of them! All that weight of\r\n\r\n      horror, between a good cigar and \u201ca little glass of anisette, monsieur, if\r\n\r\n      you won\u2019t take champagne.\u201d Still, he had to drink before he left, touch\r\n\r\n      glasses in a health, promise to come again, whenever he wished\u2014the\r\n\r\n      house was open to him. Rouletabille knew it was open to anybody\u2014anybody\r\n\r\n      who had a tale to tell, something that would send some other person to\r\n\r\n      prison or to death and oblivion. No guard at the entrance to check a\r\n\r\n      visitor\u2014men entered Gounsovski\u2019s house as the house of a friend, and\r\n\r\n      he was always ready to do you a service, certainly!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He accompanied the reporter to the stairs. Rouletabille was just about to\r\n\r\n      risk speaking of Annouchka to him, in order to approach the subject of\r\n\r\n      Natacha, when Gounsovski said suddenly, with a singular smile:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the way, do you still believe in Natacha Trebassof?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall believe in her until my death,\u201d Rouletabille thrust back; \u201cbut I\r\n\r\n      admit to you that at this moment I don\u2019t know where she has gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWatch the Bay of Lachtka, and come to tell me to-morrow if you will\r\n\r\n      believe in her always,\u201d replied Gounsovski, confidentially, with a horrid\r\n\r\n      sort of laugh that made the reporter hurry down the stairs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And now here was Priemkof to look after! Priemkof after Matiew! It seemed\r\n\r\n      to the young man that he had to contend against all the revolutionaries\r\n\r\n      not only, but all the Russian police as well\u2014and Gounsovski himself,\r\n\r\n      and Koupriane! Everybody, everybody! But most urgent was Priemkof and his\r\n\r\n      living bombs. What a strange and almost incomprehensible and harassing\r\n\r\n      adventure this was between Nihilism and the Russian police. Koupriane and\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski both employed a man they knew to be a revolutionary and the\r\n\r\n      friend of revolutionaries. Nihilism, on its side, considered this man of\r\n\r\n      the police force as one of its own agents. In his turn, this man, in order\r\n\r\n      to maintain his perilous equilibrium, had to do work for both the police\r\n\r\n      and the revolutionaries, and accept whatever either gave him to do as it\r\n\r\n      came, because it was necessary he should give them assurances of his\r\n\r\n      fidelity. Only imbeciles, like Gapone, let themselves be hanged or ended\r\n\r\n      by being executed, like Azef, because of their awkward slips. But a\r\n\r\n      Priemkof, playing both branches of the police, had a good chance of living\r\n\r\n      a long time, and a Gounsovski would die tranquilly in his bed with all the\r\n\r\n      solaces of religion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      However, the young hearts hot with sincerity, sheathed with dynamite, are\r\n\r\n      mysteriously moved in the atrocious darkness of Holy Russia, and they do\r\n\r\n      not know where they will be sent, and it is all one to them, because all\r\n\r\n      they ask is to die in a mad spiritual delirium of hate and love\u2014living\r\n\r\n      bombs!*\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At the corner of Aptiekarski-Pereoulok Rouletabille came in the way of\r\n\r\n      Koupriane, who was leaving for Pere Alexis\u2019s place and, seeing the\r\n\r\n      reporter, stopped his carriage and called that he was going immediately to\r\n\r\n      the datcha.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have seen Pere Alexis?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said Koupriane. \u201cAnd this time I have it on you. What I told you,\r\n\r\n      what I foresaw, has happened. But have you any news of the sufferers?\r\n\r\n      Apropos, rather a curious thing has happened. I met Kister on the Nevsky\r\n\r\n      just now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe physician?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, one of Trebassof\u2019s physicians whom I had sent an inspector to his\r\n\r\n      house to fetch to the datcha, as well as his usual associate, Doctor\r\n\r\n      Litchkof. Well, neither Litchkof nor he had been summoned. They didn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      know anything had happened at the datcha. They had not seen my inspector.\r\n\r\n      I hope he has met some other doctor on the way and, in view of the\r\n\r\n      urgency, has taken him to the datcha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is what has happened,\u201d replied Rouletabille, who had turned very\r\n\r\n      pale. \u201cStill, it is strange these gentlemen had not been notified, because\r\n\r\n      at the datcha the Trebassofs were told that the general\u2019s usual doctors\r\n\r\n      were not at home and so the police had summoned two others who would\r\n\r\n      arrive at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane jumped up in the carriage.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut Kister and Litchkof had not left their houses. Kister, who had just\r\n\r\n      met Litchkof, said so. What does this mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan you tell me,\u201d asked Rouletabille, ready now for the thunder-clap that\r\n\r\n      his question invited, \u201cthe name of the inspector you ordered to bring\r\n\r\n      them?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPriemkof, a man with my entire confidence.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane\u2019s carriage rushed toward the Isles. Late evening had come. Alone\r\n\r\n      on the deserted route the horses seemed headed for the stars; the carriage\r\n\r\n      behind seemed no drag upon them. The coachman bent above them, arms out,\r\n\r\n      as though he would spring into the ether. Ah, the beautiful night, the\r\n\r\n      lovely, peaceful night beside the Neva, marred by the wild gallop of these\r\n\r\n      maddened horses!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPriemkof! Priemkof! One of Gounsovski\u2019s men! I should have suspected\r\n\r\n      him,\u201d railed Koupriane after Rouletabille\u2019s explanations. \u201cBut now, shall\r\n\r\n      we arrive in time?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They stood up in the carriage, urging the coachman, exciting the horses:\r\n\r\n      \u201cScan! Scan! Faster, douriak!\u201d Could they arrive before the \u201cliving\r\n\r\n      bombs\u201d? Could they hear them before they arrived? Ah, there was Eliaguine!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They rushed from the one bank to the other as though there were no bridges\r\n\r\n      in their insensate course. And their ears were strained for the explosion,\r\n\r\n      for the abomination now to come, preparing slyly in the night so\r\n\r\n      hypocritically soft under the cold glance of the stars. Suddenly, \u201cStop,\r\n\r\n      stop!\u201d Rouletabille cried to the coachman.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you mad!\u201d shouted Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are mad if we arrive like madmen. That would make the catastrophe\r\n\r\n      sure. There is still a chance. If we wish not to lose it, then we must\r\n\r\n      arrive easily and calmly, like friends who know the general is out of\r\n\r\n      danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOur only chance is to arrive before the bogus doctors. Either they aren\u2019t\r\n\r\n      there, or it already is all over. Priemkof must have been surprised at the\r\n\r\n      affair of the poisoning, but he has seized the opportunity; fortunately he\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t find his accomplices immediately.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere is the datcha, anyway. In the name of heaven, tell your driver to\r\n\r\n      stop the horses here. If the \u2018doctors\u2019 are already there it is we who\r\n\r\n      shall have killed the general.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are right.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane moderated his excitement and that of his driver and horses, and\r\n\r\n      the carriage stopped noiselessly, not far from the datcha. Ermolai came\r\n\r\n      toward them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPriemkof?\u201d faltered Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe has gone again, Excellency.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow\u2014gone again?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, but he has brought the doctors.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane crushed Rouletabille\u2019s wrist. The doctors were there!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame Trebassof is better,\u201d continued Ermolai, who understood nothing of\r\n\r\n      their emotion. \u201cThe general is going to meet them and take them to his\r\n\r\n      wife himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are waiting in the drawing-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, Excellency, keep cool, keep cool, and all is not lost,\u201d implored the\r\n\r\n      reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and Koupriane slipped carefully into the garden. Ermolai\r\n\r\n      followed them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere?\u201d inquired Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere,\u201d Ermolai replied.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      From the corner where they were, and looking through the veranda, they\r\n\r\n      could see the \u201cdoctors\u201d as they waited.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They were seated in chairs side by side, in a corner of the drawing-room\r\n\r\n      from where they could see every-thing in the room and a part of the\r\n\r\n      garden, which they faced, and could hear everything. A window of the\r\n\r\n      first-floor was open above their heads, so that they could hear any noise\r\n\r\n      from there. They could not be surprised from any side, and they held every\r\n\r\n      door in view. They were talking softly and tranquilly, looking straight\r\n\r\n      before them. They appeared young. One had a pleasant face, pale but\r\n\r\n      smiling, with rather long, curly hair; the other was more angular, with\r\n\r\n      haughty bearing and grave face, an eagle nose and glasses. Both wore long\r\n\r\n      black coats buttoned over their calm chests.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane and the reporter, followed by Ermolai, advanced with the\r\n\r\n      greatest precaution across the lawn. Screened by the wooden steps leading\r\n\r\n      to the veranda and by the vine-clad balustrade, they got near enough to\r\n\r\n      hear them. Koupriane gave eager ear to the words of these two young men,\r\n\r\n      who might have been so rich in the many years of life that naturally\r\n\r\n      belonged to them, and who were about to die so horrible a death in\r\n\r\n      destroying all about them. They spoke of what time it was, of the softness\r\n\r\n      of the night and the beauty of the sky; they spoke of the shadows under\r\n\r\n      the birch-trees, of the gulf shining in the late evening\u2019s fading golden\r\n\r\n      light, of the river\u2019s freshness and the sweetness of springtime in the\r\n\r\n      North. That is what they talked about. Koupriane murmured, \u201cThe\r\n\r\n      assassins!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Now it was necessary to decide on action, and that necessity was horrible.\r\n\r\n      A false movement, an awkwardness, and the \u201cdoctors\u201d would be warned, and\r\n\r\n      everything lost. They must have the bombs under their coats; there were\r\n\r\n      certainly at least two \u201cliving bombs.\u201d Their chests, as they breathed,\r\n\r\n      must heave to and fro and their hearts beat against an impending\r\n\r\n      explosion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Above on the bedroom floor, they heard the rapid arranging of the room,\r\n\r\n      steps on the floor and a confusion of voices; shadows passed across the\r\n\r\n      window-space. Koupriane rapidly interrogated Ermolai and learned that all\r\n\r\n      the general\u2019s friends were there. The two doctors had arrived only a\r\n\r\n      couple of minutes before the Prefect of Police and the reporter. The\r\n\r\n      little doctor of Vassili-Ostrow had already gone, saying there was nothing\r\n\r\n      more for him to do when two such celebrated specialists had arrived.\r\n\r\n      However, in spite of their celebrity, no one had ever heard the names they\r\n\r\n      gave. Koupriane believed the little doctor was an accomplice. The most\r\n\r\n      necessary thing was to warn those in the room above. There was immediate\r\n\r\n      danger that someone would come downstairs to find the doctors and take\r\n\r\n      them to the general, or that the general would come down himself to meet\r\n\r\n      them. Evidently that was what they were waiting for. They wished to die in\r\n\r\n      his arms, to make sure that this time he did not escape them! Koupriane\r\n\r\n      directed Ermolai to go into the veranda and speak in a commonplace way to\r\n\r\n      them at the threshold of the drawing-room door, saying that he would go\r\n\r\n      upstairs and see if he might now escort them to Madame Trebassof\u2019s room.\r\n\r\n      Once in the room above, he could warn the others not to do anything but\r\n\r\n      wait for Koupriane; then Ermolai was to come down and say to the men, \u201cIn\r\n\r\n      just a moment, if you please.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai crept back as far as the lodge, and then came quite normally up\r\n\r\n      the path, letting the gravel crunch under his countrified footsteps. He\r\n\r\n      was an intelligent man, and grasped with extraordinary coolness the\r\n\r\n      importance of the plan of campaign. Easily and naturally he mounted the\r\n\r\n      veranda steps, paused at the threshold of the drawing-room, made the\r\n\r\n      remark he had been told to make, and went upstairs. Koupriane and\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille now watched the bedroom windows. The flitting shadows there\r\n\r\n      suddenly became motionless. All moving about ceased; no more steps were\r\n\r\n      heard, nothing. And that sudden silence made the two \u201cdoctors\u201d raise their\r\n\r\n      faces toward the ceiling. Then they exchanged an aroused glance. This\r\n\r\n      change in the manner of things above was dangerous. Koupriane muttered,\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe idiots!\u201d It was such a blow for those upstairs to learn they walked\r\n\r\n      over a mine ready to explode that it evidently had paralyzed their limbs.\r\n\r\n      Happily Ermolai came down almost immediately and said to the \u201cdoctors\u201d in\r\n\r\n      his very best domestic manner:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJust a second, messieurs, if you please.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He did it still with utter naturalness. And he returned to the ledge\r\n\r\n      before he rejoined Koupriane and Rouletabille by way of the lawn.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, entirely cool, quite master of himself, as calm now as\r\n\r\n      Koupriane was nervous, said to the Prefect of Police:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must act now, and quickly. They are commencing to be suspicious. Have\r\n\r\n      you a plan?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere is all I can see,\u201d said Koupriane. \u201cHave the general come down by\r\n\r\n      the narrow servants\u2019 stairway, and slip out of the house from the window\r\n\r\n      of Natacha\u2019s sitting-room, with the aid of a twisted sheet. Matrena\r\n\r\n      Petrovna will come to speak to them during this time; that will keep them\r\n\r\n      patient until the general is out of danger. As soon as Matrena has\r\n\r\n      withdrawn into the garden, I will call my men, who will shoot them from a\r\n\r\n      distance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the house itself? And the general\u2019s friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet them try to get away, too, by the servants\u2019 stairway and jump from\r\n\r\n      the window after the general. We must try something. Say that I have them\r\n\r\n      at the muzzle of my revolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour plan won\u2019t work,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cunless the door of Natacha\u2019s\r\n\r\n      sitting-room that opens on the drawing-room is closed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is. I can see from here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd unless the door of the little passage-way before that staircase that\r\n\r\n      opens into the drawing-room is closed also, and you cannot see it from\r\n\r\n      here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat door is open,\u201d said Ermolai.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane swore. But he recovered himself promptly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame Trebassof will close the door when she speaks to them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s impracticable,\u201d said the reporter. \u201cThat will arouse their\r\n\r\n      suspicions more than ever. Leave it to me; I have a plan.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have time to execute it, but not to tell you about it. They have\r\n\r\n      already waited too long. I shall have to go upstairs, though. Ermolai will\r\n\r\n      need to go with me, as with a friend of the family.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll go too.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat would give the whole show away, if they saw you, the Prefect of\r\n\r\n      Police.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, no. If they see me\u2014and they know I ought to be there\u2014as\r\n\r\n      soon as I show myself to them they will conclude I don\u2019t know anything\r\n\r\n      about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is my duty. I should be near the general to defend him until the\r\n\r\n      last.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders before this dangerous heroism, but he\r\n\r\n      did not stop to argue. He knew that his plan must succeed at once, or in\r\n\r\n      five minutes at the latest there would be only ruins, the dead and the\r\n\r\n      dying in the datcha des Iles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Still he remained astonishingly calm. In principle he had admitted that he\r\n\r\n      was going to die. The only hope of being saved which remained to them\r\n\r\n      rested entirely upon their keeping perfectly cool and upon the patience of\r\n\r\n      the living bombs. Would they still have three minutes\u2019 patience?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ermolai went ahead of Koupriane and Rouletabille. At the moment they\r\n\r\n      reached the foot of the veranda steps the servant said loudly, repeating\r\n\r\n      his lesson:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, the general is waiting for you, Excellency. He told me to have you\r\n\r\n      come to him at once. He is entirely well and Madame Trebassof also.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      When they were in the veranda, he added:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is to see also, at once, these gentlemen, who will be able to tell\r\n\r\n      her there is no more danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And all three passed while Koupriane and Rouletabille vaguely saluted the\r\n\r\n      two conspirators in the drawing-room. It was a decisive moment.\r\n\r\n      Recognizing Koupriane, the two Nihilists might well believe themselves\r\n\r\n      discovered, as the reporter had said, and precipitate the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n      However, Ermolai, Koupriane and Rouletabille climbed the stairs to the\r\n\r\n      bedroom like automatons, not daring to look behind them, and expecting the\r\n\r\n      end each instant. But neither stirred. Ermolai went down again, by\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s order, normally, naturally, tranquilly. They went into\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna\u2019s chamber. Everybody was there. It was a gathering of\r\n\r\n      ghosts.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here was what had happened above. That the \u201cdoctors\u201d still remained below,\r\n\r\n      that they had not been received instantly, in brief, that the catastrophe\r\n\r\n      had been delayed up to now was due to Matrena Petrovna, whose watchful\r\n\r\n      love, like a watch-dog, was always ready to scent danger. These two\r\n\r\n      \u201cdoctors\u201d whose names she did not know, who arrived so late, and the\r\n\r\n      precipitate departure of the little doctor of Vassili-Ostrow aroused her\r\n\r\n      watchfulness. Before allowing them to come upstairs to the general she\r\n\r\n      resolved to have a look at them herself downstairs. She arose from her bed\r\n\r\n      for that; and now her presentiment was justified. When she saw Ermolai,\r\n\r\n      sober and mysterious, enter with Koupriane\u2019s message, she knew\r\n\r\n      instinctively, before he spoke, that there were bombs in the house. When\r\n\r\n      Ermolai did speak it was a blow for everybody. At first she, Matrena\r\n\r\n      Perovna, had been a frightened, foolish figure in the big flowered\r\n\r\n      dressing-gown belonging to Feodor that she had wrapped about her in her\r\n\r\n      haste. When Ermolai left, the general, who knew she only trembled for him,\r\n\r\n      tried to reassure her, and, in the midst of the frightened silence of all\r\n\r\n      of them, said a few words recalling the failure of all the previous\r\n\r\n      attempts. But she shook her head and trembled, shaking with fear for him,\r\n\r\n      in agony at the thought that she could do nothing there above those living\r\n\r\n      bombs but wait for them to burst. As to the friends, already their limbs\r\n\r\n      were ruined, absolutely ruined, in very truth. For a moment they were\r\n\r\n      quite incapable of moving. The jolly Councilor of Empire, Ivan Petrovitch,\r\n\r\n      had no longer a lively tale to tell, and the abominable prospect of \u201cthis\r\n\r\n      horrible mix-up\u201d right at hand rendered him much less gay than in his best\r\n\r\n      hours at Cubat\u2019s place. And poor Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff was whiter than\r\n\r\n      the snow that covers old Lithuania\u2019s fields when the winter\u2019s chase is on.\r\n\r\n      Athanase Georgevitch himself was not brilliant, and his sanguine face had\r\n\r\n      quite changed, as though he had difficulty in digesting his last\r\n\r\n      masterpiece with knife and fork. But, in justice to them, that was the\r\n\r\n      first instantaneous effect. No one could learn like that, all of a sudden,\r\n\r\n      that they were about to die in an indiscriminate slaughter without the\r\n\r\n      heart being stopped for a little. Ermolai\u2019s words had turned these amiable\r\n\r\n      loafers into waxen statues, but, little by little, their hearts commenced\r\n\r\n      to beat again and each suggested some way of preventing the disaster\u2014all\r\n\r\n      of them sufficiently incoherent\u2014while Matrena Petrovna invoked the\r\n\r\n      Virgin and at the same time helped Feodor Feodorovitch adjust his sword\r\n\r\n      and buckle his belt; for the general wished to die in uniform.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Athanase Georgevitch, his eyes sticking out of his head and his body bent\r\n\r\n      as though he feared the Nihlists just below him might perceive his tall\r\n\r\n      form\u2014through the floor, no doubt\u2014proposed that they should\r\n\r\n      throw themselves out of the window, even at the cost of broken legs. The\r\n\r\n      saddened Councilor of Empire declared that project simply idiotic, for as\r\n\r\n      they fell they would be absolutely at the disposal of the Nihilists, who\r\n\r\n      would be attracted by the noise and would make a handful of dust of them\r\n\r\n      with a single gesture through the window. Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff, who\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t think of anything at all, blamed Koupriane and the rest of the\r\n\r\n      police for not having devised something. Why hadn\u2019t they already got rid\r\n\r\n      of these Nihilists? After the frightened silence they had kept at first,\r\n\r\n      now they all spoke at once, in low voices, hoarse and rapid, with\r\n\r\n      shortened breath, making wild movements of the arms and head, and walked\r\n\r\n      here and there in the chamber quite without motive, but very softly on\r\n\r\n      tiptoe, going to the windows, returning, listening at the doors, peering\r\n\r\n      through the key-holes, exchanging absurd suggestions, full of the wildest\r\n\r\n      imaginings. \u201cIf we should... if... if,\u201d\u2014everybody speaking and\r\n\r\n      everybody making signs for the others to be quiet. \u201cLower! If they hear\r\n\r\n      us, we are lost.\u201d And Koupriane, who did not come, and his police, who\r\n\r\n      themselves had brought two assassins into the house, and were not able now\r\n\r\n      to make them leave without having everybody jump! They were certainly\r\n\r\n      lost. There was nothing left but to say their prayers. They turned to the\r\n\r\n      general and Matrena Petrovna, who were wrapped in a close embrace. Feodor\r\n\r\n      had taken the poor disheveled head of the good Matrena between his hands\r\n\r\n      and pressed it upon his shoulders as he embraced her. He said, \u201cRest\r\n\r\n      quietly against my heart, Matrena Petrovna. Nothing can happen to us\r\n\r\n      except what God wills.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that sight and that remark the others grew ashamed of their confusion.\r\n\r\n      The harmony of that couple embracing in the presence of death restored\r\n\r\n      them to themselves, to their courage, and their \u201cNitchevo.\u201d Athanase\r\n\r\n      Georgevitch, Ivan Petrovitch and Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff repeated after\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna, \u201cAs God wills.\u201d And then they said \u201cNitchevo! Nitchevo!*\r\n\r\n      We will all die with you, Feodor Feodorovitch.\u201d And they all kissed one\r\n\r\n      another and clasped one another in their arms, their eyes dim with love\r\n\r\n      one for another, as at the end of a great banquet when they had eaten and\r\n\r\n      drunk heavily in honor of one another.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen. Someone is coming up the stairs,\u201d whispered Matrena, with her\r\n\r\n      keen ear, and she slipped from the restraint of her husband.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Breathless, they all hurried to the door opening on the landing, but with\r\n\r\n      steps as light \u201cas though they walked on eggs.\u201d All four of them were\r\n\r\n      leaning over there close by the door, hardly daring to breathe. They heard\r\n\r\n      two men on the stairs. Were they Koupriane and Rouletabille, or were they\r\n\r\n      the others? They had revolvers in their hands and drew back a little when\r\n\r\n      the footsteps sounded near the door. Behind them Trebassof was quietly\r\n\r\n      seated in his chair. The door was opened and Koupriane and Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      perceived these death-like figures, motionless and mute. No one dared to\r\n\r\n      speak or make a movement until the door had been closed. But then:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell? Well? Save us! Where are they? Ah, my dear little domovoi-doukh,\r\n\r\n      save the general, for the love of the Virgin!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTsst! tsst! Silence.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, very pale, but calm, spoke:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe plan is simple. They are between the two staircases, watching the one\r\n\r\n      and the other. I will go and find them and make them mount the one while\r\n\r\n      you descend by the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCaracho! That is simple enough. Why didn\u2019t we think of it sooner? Because\r\n\r\n      everybody lost his head except the dear little domovoi-doukh!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But here something happened Rouletabille had not counted on. The general\r\n\r\n      rose and said, \u201cYou have forgotten one thing, my young friend; that is\r\n\r\n      that General Trebassof will not descend by the servants\u2019 stairway.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      His friends looked at him in stupefaction, and asked if he had gone mad.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is this you say, Feodor?\u201d implored Matrena.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI say,\u201d insisted the general, \u201cthat I have had enough of this comedy, and\r\n\r\n      that since Monsieur Koupriane has not been able to arrest these men, and\r\n\r\n      since, on their side, they don\u2019t seem to decide to do their duty, I shall\r\n\r\n      go myself and put them out of my house.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He started a few steps, but had not his cane and suddenly he tottered.\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna jumped to him and lifted him in her arms as though he\r\n\r\n      were a feather.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot by the servants\u2019 stairway, not by the servants\u2019 stairway,\u201d growled\r\n\r\n      the obstinate general.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will go,\u201d Matrena replied to him, \u201cby the way I take you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And she carried him back into the apartment while she said quickly to\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo, little domovoi! And God protect us!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille disappeared at once through the door to the main staircase,\r\n\r\n      and the group attended by Koupriane, passed through the dressing-room and\r\n\r\n      the general\u2019s chamber, Matrena Petrovna in the lead with her precious\r\n\r\n      burden. Ivan Petrovitch had his hand already on the famous bolt which\r\n\r\n      locked the door to the servants\u2019 staircase when they all turned at the\r\n\r\n      sound of a quick step behind them. Rouletabille had returned.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are no longer in the drawing-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot in the drawing-room! Where are they, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille pointed to the door they were about to open.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps behind that door. Take care!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      All drew back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut Ermolai ought to know where they are,\u201d exclaimed Koupriane. \u201cPerhaps\r\n\r\n      they have gone, finding out they were discovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have assassinated Ermolai.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAssassinated Ermolai!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have seen his body lying in the middle of the drawing-room as I leaned\r\n\r\n      over the top of the banister. But they were not in the room, and I was\r\n\r\n      afraid you would run into them, for they may well be hidden in the\r\n\r\n      servants\u2019 stairway.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen open the window, Koupriane, and call your men to deliver us.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am quite willing,\u201d replied Koupriane coldly, \u201cbut it is the signal for\r\n\r\n      our deaths.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, why do they wait so to make us die?\u201d muttered Feodor Feodorovitch.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI find them very tedious about it, for myself. What are you doing, Ivan\r\n\r\n      Petrovitch?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The spectral figure of Ivan Petrovitch, bent beside the door of the\r\n\r\n      stairway, seemed to be hearing things the others could not catch, but\r\n\r\n      which frightened them so that they fled from the general\u2019s chamber in\r\n\r\n      disorder. Ivan Petrovitch was close on them, his eyes almost sticking from\r\n\r\n      his head, his mouth babbling:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are there! They are there!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Athanase Georgevitch open a window wildly and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am going to jump.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Thaddeus Tchitchnikofl\u2019 stopped him with a word. \u201cFor me, I shall not\r\n\r\n      leave Feodor Feodorovitch.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Athanase and Ivan both felt ashamed, and trembling, but brave, they\r\n\r\n      gathered round the general and said, \u201cWe will die together, we will die\r\n\r\n      together. We have lived with Feodor Feodorovitch, and we will die with\r\n\r\n      him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are they waiting for? What are they waiting for?\u201d grumbled the\r\n\r\n      general.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna\u2019s teeth chattered. \u201cThey are waiting for us to go down,\u201d\r\n\r\n       said Koupraine.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well, let us do it. This thing must end,\u201d said Feodor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u201d they all said, for the situation was becoming intolerable;\r\n\r\n      \u201cenough of this. Go on down. Go on down. God, the Virgin and Saints Peter\r\n\r\n      and Paul protect us. Let us go.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The whole group, therefore, went to the main staircase, with the movements\r\n\r\n      of drunken men, fantastic waving of the arms, mouths speaking all\r\n\r\n      together, saying things no one but themselves understood. Rouletabille had\r\n\r\n      already hurriedly preceded them, was down the staircase, had time to throw\r\n\r\n      a glance into the drawing-room, stepped over Ermolai\u2019s huge corpse,\r\n\r\n      entered Natacha\u2019s sitting-room and her chamber, found all these places\r\n\r\n      deserted and bounded back into the veranda at the moment the others\r\n\r\n      commenced to descend the steps around Feodor Feodorovitch. The reporter\u2019s\r\n\r\n      eyes searched all the dark corners and had perceived nothing suspicious\r\n\r\n      when, in the veranda, he moved a chair. A shadow detached itself from it\r\n\r\n      and glided under the staircase. Rouletabille cried to the group on the\r\n\r\n      stairs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are under the staircase!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then Rouletabille confronted a sight that he could never forget all his\r\n\r\n      life.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At this cry, they all stopped, after an instinctive move to go back.\r\n\r\n      Feodor Feodorovitch, who was still in Matrena Petrovna\u2019s arms, cried:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVive le Tsar!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And then, those whom the reporter half expected to see flee, distracted,\r\n\r\n      one way and another, or to throw themselves madly from the height of the\r\n\r\n      steps, abandoning Feodor and Matrena, gathered themselves instead by a\r\n\r\n      spontaneous movement around the general, like a guard of honor, in battle,\r\n\r\n      around the flag. Koupriane marched ahead. And they insisted also upon\r\n\r\n      descending the terrible steps slowly, and sang the Bodje tsara Krani, the\r\n\r\n      national anthem!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With an overwhelming roar, which shocked earth and sky and the ears of\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, the entire house seemed lifted in the air; the staircase\r\n\r\n      rose amid flame and smoke, and the group which sang the Bodje tsara Krani\r\n\r\n      disappeared in a horrible apotheosis.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XIV. THE MARSHES\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They ascertained the next day that there had been two explosions, almost\r\n\r\n      simultaneous, one under each staircase. The two Nihilists, when they felt\r\n\r\n      themselves discovered, and watched by Ermolai, had thrown themselves\r\n\r\n      silently on him as he turned his back in passing them, and strangled him\r\n\r\n      with a piece of twine. Then they separated each to watch one of the\r\n\r\n      staircases, reasoning that Koupriane and General Trebassof would have to\r\n\r\n      decide to descend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The datcha des Iles was nothing now but a smoking ruin. But from the fact\r\n\r\n      that the living bombs had exploded separately the destructive effect was\r\n\r\n      diffused, and although there were numerous wounded, as in the case of the\r\n\r\n      attack on the Stolypine datcha, at least no one was killed outright; that\r\n\r\n      is, excepting the two Nihilists, of whom no trace could be found save a\r\n\r\n      few rags.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had been hurled into the garden and he was glad enough to\r\n\r\n      escape so, a little shaken, but without a scratch. The group composed of\r\n\r\n      Feodor and his friends were strangely protected by the lightness of the\r\n\r\n      datcha\u2019s construction. The iron staircase, which, so to speak, almost hung\r\n\r\n      to the two floors, being barely attached at top and bottom, raised under\r\n\r\n      them and then threw them off as it broke into a thousand pieces, but only\r\n\r\n      after, by its very yielding, it had protected them from the first force of\r\n\r\n      the bomb. They had risen from the ruins without mortal wounds. Koupriane\r\n\r\n      had a hand badly burned, Athanase Georgevitch had his nose and cheeks\r\n\r\n      seriously hurt, Ivan Petrovitch lost an ear; the most seriously injured\r\n\r\n      was Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff, both of whose legs were broken.\r\n\r\n      Extraordinarily enough, the first person who appeared, rising from the\r\n\r\n      midst of the wreckage, was Matrena Petrovna, still holding Feodor in her\r\n\r\n      arms. She had escaped with a few burns and the general, saved again by the\r\n\r\n      luck of the soldier whom Death does not want, was absolutely uninjured.\r\n\r\n      Feodor gave shouts of joy. They strove to quiet him, because, after all,\r\n\r\n      around him some poor wretches had been badly hurt, as well as poor\r\n\r\n      Ermolai, who lay there dead. The domestics in the basement had been more\r\n\r\n      seriously wounded and burned because the main force of the explosion had\r\n\r\n      gone downwards; which had probably saved the personages above.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had been taken with the other victims to a neighboring\r\n\r\n      datcha; but as soon as he had shaken himself free of that terrible\r\n\r\n      nightmare he escaped from the place. He really regretted that he was not\r\n\r\n      dead. These successive waves of events had swamped him; and he accused\r\n\r\n      himself alone of all this disaster. With acutest anxiety he had inquired\r\n\r\n      about the condition of each of \u201chis victims.\u201d Feodor had not been wounded,\r\n\r\n      but now he was almost delirious, asking every other minute as the hours\r\n\r\n      crept on for Natacha, who had not reappeared. That unhappy girl\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had steadily believed innocent. Was she a culprit? \u201cAh, if\r\n\r\n      she had only chosen to! If she had had confidence,\u201d he cried, raising\r\n\r\n      anguished hands towards heaven, \u201cnone of all this need have happened. No\r\n\r\n      one would have attacked and no one would ever again attack the life of\r\n\r\n      Trebassof. For I was not wrong in claiming before Koupriane that the\r\n\r\n      general\u2019s life was in my hand, and I had the right to say to him, \u2018Life\r\n\r\n      for life! Give me Matiew\u2019s and I will give you the general\u2019s.\u2019 And now\r\n\r\n      there has been one more fruitless attempt to kill Feodor Feodorovitch and\r\n\r\n      it is Natacha\u2019s fault\u2014that I swear, because she would not listen to\r\n\r\n      me. And is Natacha implicated in it? O my God\u201d Rouletabille asked this\r\n\r\n      vain question of the Divinity, for he expected no more help in answering\r\n\r\n      it on earth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Natacha! Innocent or guilty, where was she? What was she doing? to know\r\n\r\n      that! To know if one were right or wrong\u2014and if one were wrong, to\r\n\r\n      disappear, to die!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thus the unhappy Rouletabille muttered as he walked along the bank of the\r\n\r\n      Neva, not far from the ruins of the poor datcha, where the joyous friends\r\n\r\n      of Feodor Feodorovitch would have no more good dinners, never; so he\r\n\r\n      soliloquized, his head on fire.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And, all at once, he recovered trace of the young girl, that trace lost\r\n\r\n      earlier, a trace left at her moment of flight, after the poisoning and\r\n\r\n      before the explosion. And had he not in that a terrible coincidence?\r\n\r\n      Because the poison might well have been only in preparation for the final\r\n\r\n      attack, the pretext for the tragic arrival of the two false doctors.\r\n\r\n      Natacha, Natacha, the living mystery surrounded already by so many dead!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Not far from the ruins of the datcha Rouletabille soon made sure that a\r\n\r\n      group of people had been there the night before, coming from the woods\r\n\r\n      near-by, and returning to them. He was able to be sure of this because the\r\n\r\n      boundaries of the datcha had been guarded by troops and police as soon as\r\n\r\n      the explosion took place, under orders to keep back the crowd that hurried\r\n\r\n      to Eliaguine. He looked attentively at the grass, the ferns, the broken\r\n\r\n      and trampled twigs. Certainly a struggle had occurred there. He could\r\n\r\n      distinguish clearly in the soft earth of a narrow glade the prints of\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s two little boots among all the large footprints.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He continued his search with his heart heavier and heavier, he had a\r\n\r\n      presentiment that he was on the point of discovering a new misfortune. The\r\n\r\n      footprints passed steadily under the branches along the side of the Neva.\r\n\r\n      From a bush he picked a shred of white cloth, and it seemed to him a\r\n\r\n      veritable battle had taken place there. Torn branches strewed the grass.\r\n\r\n      He went on. Very close to the bank he saw by examination of the soil,\r\n\r\n      where there was no more trace of tiny heels and little soles, that the\r\n\r\n      woman who had been found there was carried, and carried, into a boat, of\r\n\r\n      which the place of fastening to the bank was still visible.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have carried off Natacha,\u201d he cried in a surge of anguish. \u201cbungler\r\n\r\n      that I am, that is my fault too\u2014all my fault\u2014all my fault!\r\n\r\n      They wished to avenge Michael Nikolaievitch\u2019s death, for which they hold\r\n\r\n      Natacha responsible, and they have kidnapped her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      His eyes searched the great arm of the river for a boat. The river was\r\n\r\n      deserted. Not a sail, nothing visible on the dead waters! \u201cWhat shall I\r\n\r\n      do? What shall I do? I must save her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He resumed his course along the river. Who could give him any useful\r\n\r\n      information? He drew near a little shelter occupied by a guard. The guard\r\n\r\n      was speaking to an officer. Perhaps he had noticed something during his\r\n\r\n      watch that evening along the river. That branch of the river was almost\r\n\r\n      always deserted after the day was over. A boat plying between these shores\r\n\r\n      in the twilight would certainly attract attention. Rouletabille showed the\r\n\r\n      guard the paper Koupriane had given him in the beginning, and with the\r\n\r\n      officer (who turned out to be a police officer) as interpreter, he asked\r\n\r\n      his questions. As a matter of fact the guard had been sufficiently puzzled\r\n\r\n      by the doings and comings of a light boat which, after disappearing for an\r\n\r\n      instant, around the bend of the river, had suddenly rowed swiftly out\r\n\r\n      again and accosted a sailing-yacht which appeared at the opening of the\r\n\r\n      gulf. It was one of those small but rapid and elegant sailing craft such\r\n\r\n      as are seen in the Lachtka regattas.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Lachtka! \u201cThe Bay of Lachtka!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The word was a ray of light for the reporter, who recalled now the counsel\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski had given him. \u201cWatch the Bay of Lachtka, and tell me then if\r\n\r\n      you still believe Natacha is innocent!\u201d Gounsovski must have known when he\r\n\r\n      said this that Natacha had embarked in company with the Nihilists, but\r\n\r\n      evidently he was ignorant that she had gone with them under compulsion, as\r\n\r\n      their prisoner.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Was it too late to save Natacha? In any case, before he died, he would try\r\n\r\n      in every way possible, so as at least to have kept her as much as he could\r\n\r\n      from the disaster for which he held himself responsible. He ran to the\r\n\r\n      Barque, near the Point.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      His voice was firm as he hailed the canoe of the floating restaurant\r\n\r\n      where, thanks to him, Koupriane had been thwarted in impotent anger. He\r\n\r\n      had himself taken to just below Staria-Derevnia and jumped out at the spot\r\n\r\n      where he saw little Katharina disappear a few days before. He landed in\r\n\r\n      the mud and climbed on hands and knees up the slope of a roadway which\r\n\r\n      followed the bank. This bank led to the Bay of Lachtka, not far from the\r\n\r\n      frontier of Finland.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On Rouletabille\u2019s left lay the sea, the immense gulf with slight waves; to\r\n\r\n      his right was the decaying stretch of the marsh. Stagnant water stretching\r\n\r\n      to the horizon, coarse grass and reeds, an extraordinary tangle of\r\n\r\n      water-plants, small ponds whose greenish scum did not stir under the stiff\r\n\r\n      breeze, water that was heavy and dirty. Along this narrow strip of land\r\n\r\n      thrust thus between the marsh, the sky and the sea, he hurried, with many\r\n\r\n      stumblings, his eyes fixed on the deserted gulf. Suddenly he turned his\r\n\r\n      head at a singular noise. At first he didn\u2019t see anything, but heard in\r\n\r\n      the distance a vague clamoring while a sort of vapor commenced to rise\r\n\r\n      from the marsh. And then he noticed, nearer him, the high marsh grasses\r\n\r\n      undulating. Finally he saw a countless flock rising from the bed of the\r\n\r\n      marshes. Beasts, groups of beasts, whose horns one saw like bayonets,\r\n\r\n      jostled each other trying to keep to the firm land. Many of them swam and\r\n\r\n      on the backs of some were naked men, stark naked, with hair falling to\r\n\r\n      their shoulders and streaming behind them like manes. They shouted\r\n\r\n      war-cries and waved their clubs. Rouletabille stopped short before this\r\n\r\n      prehistoric invasion. He would never have imagined that a few miles from\r\n\r\n      the Nevsky Prospect he could have found himself in the midst of such a\r\n\r\n      spectacle. These savages had not even a loin-cloth. Where did they come\r\n\r\n      from with their herd? From what remote place in the world or in old and\r\n\r\n      gone history had they emerged? What was this new invasion? What prodigious\r\n\r\n      slaughter-house awaited these unruly herds? They made a noise like thunder\r\n\r\n      in the marsh. Here were a thousand unkempt haunches undulating in the\r\n\r\n      marsh like the ocean as a storm approaches. The stark-naked men jumped\r\n\r\n      along the route, waving their clubs, crying gutturally in a way the beasts\r\n\r\n      seemed to understand. They worked their way out from the marsh and turned\r\n\r\n      toward the city, leaving behind, to swathe the view of them a while and\r\n\r\n      then fade away, a pestilential haze that hung like an aura about the\r\n\r\n      naked, long-haired men. It was terrible and magnificent. In order not to\r\n\r\n      be shoved into the water, Rouletabille had climbed a small rock that stood\r\n\r\n      beside the route, and had waited there as though petrified himself. When\r\n\r\n      the barbarians had finally passed by he climbed down again, but the route\r\n\r\n      had become a bog of trampled filth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Happily, he heard the noise of a primitive conveyance behind him. It was a\r\n\r\n      telega. Curiously primitive, the telega is four-wheeled, with two planks\r\n\r\n      thrown crudely across the axle-trees. Rouletabille gave the man who was\r\n\r\n      seated in it three roubles, and jumped into the planks beside him, and the\r\n\r\n      two little Finnish horses, whose manes hung clear to the mud, went like\r\n\r\n      the wind. Such crude conveyances are necessary on such crude roads, but it\r\n\r\n      requires a strong constitution to make a journey on them. Still, the\r\n\r\n      reporter felt none of the jolting, he was so intent on the sea and the\r\n\r\n      coast of Lachtka Bay. The vehicle finally reached a wooden bridge, across\r\n\r\n      a murky creek. As the day commenced to fade colorlessly, Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      jumped off onto the shore and his rustic equipage crossed to the\r\n\r\n      Sestroriesk side. It was a corner of land black and somber as his thoughts\r\n\r\n      that he surveyed now. \u201cWatch the Bay of Lachtka!\u201d The reporter knew that\r\n\r\n      this desolate plain, this impenetrable marsh, this sea which offered the\r\n\r\n      fugitive refuge in innumerable fords, had always been a useful retreat for\r\n\r\n      Nihilistic adventurers. A hundred legends circulated in St. Petersburg\r\n\r\n      about the mysteries of Lachtka marshes. And that gave him his last hope.\r\n\r\n      Maybe he would be able to run across some revolutionaries to whom he could\r\n\r\n      explain about Natacha, as prudently as possible; he might even see Natacha\r\n\r\n      herself. Gounsovski could not have spoken vain words to him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Between the Lachtkrinsky marsh and the strand he perceived on the edge of\r\n\r\n      the forests which run as far as Sestroriesk a little wooden house whose\r\n\r\n      walls were painted a reddish-brown, and its roof green. It was not the\r\n\r\n      Russian isba, but the Finnish touba. However, a Russian sign announced it\r\n\r\n      to be a restaurant. The young man had to take only a few steps to enter\r\n\r\n      it. He was the only customer there. An old man, with glasses and a long\r\n\r\n      gray beard, evidently the proprietor of the establishment, stood behind\r\n\r\n      the counter, presiding over the zakouskis. Rouletabille chose some little\r\n\r\n      sandwiches which he placed on a plate. He took a bottle of pivo and made\r\n\r\n      the man understand that later, if it were possible, he would like a good\r\n\r\n      hot supper. The other made a sign that he understood and showed him into\r\n\r\n      an adjoining room which was used for diners. Rouletabille was quite ready\r\n\r\n      enough to die in the face of his failures, but he did not wish to perish\r\n\r\n      from hunger.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      A table was placed beside a window looking out over the sea and over the\r\n\r\n      entrance to the bay. It could not have been better and, with his eye now\r\n\r\n      on the horizon, now on the estuary near-by, he commenced to eat with\r\n\r\n      gloomy avidity. He was inclined to feel sorry for himself, to indulge in\r\n\r\n      self-pity. \u201cJust the same, two and two always make four,\u201d he said to\r\n\r\n      himself; \u201cbut in my calculations perhaps I have forgotten the surd. Ah,\r\n\r\n      there was a time when I would not have overlooked anything. And even now I\r\n\r\n      haven\u2019t overlooked anything, if Natacha is innocent!\u201d Having literally\r\n\r\n      scoured the plate, he struck the table a great blow with his fist and\r\n\r\n      said: \u201cShe is!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Just then the door opened. Rouletabille supposed the proprietor of the\r\n\r\n      place was entering.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was Koupriane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He rose, startled. He could not imagine by what mystery the Prefect of\r\n\r\n      Police had made his way there, but he rejoiced from the bottom of his\r\n\r\n      heart, for if he was trying to rescue Natacha from the hands of the\r\n\r\n      revolutionaries Koupriane would be a valuable ally. He clapped the Prefect\r\n\r\n      on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, well!\u201d he said, almost joyfully. \u201cI certainly did not expect you\r\n\r\n      here. How is your wound?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNitchevo! Not worth speaking about; it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the general and\u2014! Ah, that frightful night! And those two\r\n\r\n      unfortunates who\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNitchevo! Nitchevo!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd poor Ermolai!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNitchevo! Nitchevo! It is nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked him over. The Prefect of Police had an arm in a sling,\r\n\r\n      but he was bright and shining as a new ten-rouble piece, while he, poor\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, was so abominably soiled and depressed. Where did he come\r\n\r\n      from? Koupriane understood his look and smiled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I have just come from the Finland train; it is the best way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what can you have come here to do, Excellency?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe same thing as you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBah!\u201d exclaimed Rouletabille, \u201cdo you mean to say that you have come here\r\n\r\n      to save Natacha?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow\u2014to save her! I come to capture her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo capture her?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Rouletabille, I have a very fine little dungeon in Saints Peter\r\n\r\n      and Paul fortress that is all ready for her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are going to throw Natacha into a dungeon!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s order, Monsieur Rouletabille. And if you see me here in\r\n\r\n      person it is simply because His Majesty requires that the thing be done as\r\n\r\n      respectfully and discreetly as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha in prison!\u201d cried the reporter, who saw in horror all obstacles\r\n\r\n      rising before him at one and the same time. \u201cFor what reasons, pray?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe reason is simple enough. Natacha Feodorovna is the last word in\r\n\r\n      wickedness and doesn\u2019t deserve anybody\u2019s pity. She is the accomplice of\r\n\r\n      the revolutionaries and the instigator of all the crimes against her\r\n\r\n      father.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure that you are mistaken, Excellency. But how have you been guided\r\n\r\n      to her?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSimply by you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, we lost all trace of Natacha. But, as you had disappeared also, I\r\n\r\n      made up my mind that you could only be occupied in searching for her, and\r\n\r\n      that by finding you I might have the chance to lay my hands on her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen any of your men?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, one of them brought you here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMe?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, you. Didn\u2019t you climb onto a telega?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, the driver.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. I had arranged to have him meet me at the Sestroriesk station.\r\n\r\n      He pointed out the place where you dropped off, and here I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter bent his head, red with chagrin. Decidedly the sinister idea\r\n\r\n      that he was responsible for the death of an innocent man and all the ills\r\n\r\n      which had followed out of it had paralyzed his detective talents. He\r\n\r\n      recognized it now. What was the use of struggling! If anyone had told him\r\n\r\n      that he would be played with that way sometime, he, Rouletabille! he would\r\n\r\n      have laughed heartily enough\u2014then. But now, well, he wasn\u2019t capable\r\n\r\n      of anything further. He was his own most cruel enemy. Not only was Natacha\r\n\r\n      in the hands of the revolutionaries through his fault, by his abominable\r\n\r\n      error, but worse yet, in the very moment when he wished to save her, he\r\n\r\n      foolishly, naively, had conducted the police to the very spot where they\r\n\r\n      should have been kept away. It was the depth of his humiliation; Koupriane\r\n\r\n      really pitied the reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome, don\u2019t blame yourself too much,\u201d said he. \u201cWe would have found\r\n\r\n      Natacha without you; Gounsovski notified us that she was going to embark\r\n\r\n      in the Bay of Lachtka this evening with Priemkof.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha with Priemkof!\u201d exclaimed Rouletabille. \u201cNatacha with the man who\r\n\r\n      introduced the two living bombs into her father\u2019s house! If she is with\r\n\r\n      him, Excellency, it is because she is his prisoner, and that alone will be\r\n\r\n      sufficient to prove her innocence. I thank the Heaven that has sent you\r\n\r\n      here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane swallowed a glass of vodka, poured another after it, and finally\r\n\r\n      deigned to translate his thought:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha is the friend of these precious men and we will see them\r\n\r\n      disembark hand in hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour men, then, haven\u2019t studied the traces of the struggle that \u2018these\r\n\r\n      precious men\u2019 have had on the banks of the Neva before they carried away\r\n\r\n      Natacha?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, they haven\u2019t been hoodwinked. As a matter of fact, the struggle was\r\n\r\n      quite too visible not to have been done for appearances\u2019 sake. What a\r\n\r\n      child you are! Can\u2019t you see that Natacha\u2019s presence in the datcha had\r\n\r\n      become quite too dangerous for that charming young girl after the\r\n\r\n      poisoning of her father and step-mother failed and at the moment when her\r\n\r\n      comrades were preparing to send General Trebassof a pleasant little gift\r\n\r\n      of dynamite? She arranged to get away and yet to appear kidnapped. It is\r\n\r\n      too simple.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille raised his head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is something simpler still to imagine than the culpability of\r\n\r\n      Natacha. It is that Priemkof schemed to pour the poison into the flask of\r\n\r\n      vodka, saying to himself that if the poison didn\u2019t succeed at least it\r\n\r\n      would make the occasion for introducing his dynamite into the house in the\r\n\r\n      pockets of the \u2018doctors\u2019 that they would go to find.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane seized Rouletabille\u2019s wrist and threw some terrible words at\r\n\r\n      him, looking into the depths of his eyes:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was not Priemkof who poured the poison, because there was no poison in\r\n\r\n      the flask.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, as he heard this extraordinary declaration, rose, more\r\n\r\n      startled than he had ever been in the course of this startling campaign.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      If there was no poison in the flask, the poison must have been poured\r\n\r\n      directly into the glasses by a person who was in the kiosk! Now, there\r\n\r\n      were only four persons in the kiosk: the two who were poisoned and Natacha\r\n\r\n      and himself, Rouletabille. And that kiosk was so perfectly isolated that\r\n\r\n      it was impossible for any other persons than the four who were there to\r\n\r\n      pour poison upon the table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it is not possible!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is so possible that it is so. Pere Alexis declared that there is no\r\n\r\n      poison in the flask, and I ought to tell you that an analysis I had made\r\n\r\n      after his bears him out. There was no poison, either, in the small bottle\r\n\r\n      you took to Pere Alexis and into which you yourself had poured the\r\n\r\n      contents of Natacha\u2019s glass and yours; no trace of poison excepting in two\r\n\r\n      of the four glasses, arsenate of soda was found only on the soiled napkins\r\n\r\n      of Trebassof and his wife and in the two glasses they drank from.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, that is horrible,\u201d muttered the stupefied reporter; \u201cthat is\r\n\r\n      horrible, for then the poisoner must be either Natacha or me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have every confidence in you,\u201d declared Koupriane with a great laugh of\r\n\r\n      satisfaction, striking him on the shoulder. \u201cAnd I arrest Natacha, and you\r\n\r\n      who love logic ought to be satisfied now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille hadn\u2019t a word more to say. He sat down again and let his head\r\n\r\n      fall into his hands, like one sleep has seized.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, our young girls; you don\u2019t know them. They are terrible, terrible!\u201d\r\n\r\n       said Koupriane, lighting a big cigar. \u201cMuch more terrible than the boys.\r\n\r\n      In good families the boys still enjoy themselves; but the girls\u2014they\r\n\r\n      read! It goes to their heads. They are ready for anything; they know\r\n\r\n      neither father nor mother. Ah, you are a child, you cannot comprehend. Two\r\n\r\n      lovely eyes, a melancholy air, a soft, low voice, and you are captured\u2014you\r\n\r\n      believe you have before you simply an inoffensive, good little girl. Well,\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, here is what I will tell you for your instruction. There was\r\n\r\n      the time of the Tchipoff attack; the revolutionaries who were assigned to\r\n\r\n      kill Tchipoff were disguised as coachmen and footmen. Everything had been\r\n\r\n      carefully prepared and it would seem that no one could have discovered the\r\n\r\n      bombs in the place they had been stored. Well, do you know the place where\r\n\r\n      those bombs were found? In the rooms of the governor, of Wladmir\u2019s\r\n\r\n      daughter! Exactly, my little friend, just there! The rooms of the\r\n\r\n      governor\u2019s daughter, Mademoiselle Alexeieiv. Ah, these young girls!\r\n\r\n      Besides, it was this same Mademoiselle Alexeieiv who, so prettily, pierced\r\n\r\n      the brain of an honest Swiss merchant who had the misfortune to resemble\r\n\r\n      one of our ministers. If we had hanged that charming young girl earlier,\r\n\r\n      my dear Monsieur Rouletabille, that last catastrophe might have been\r\n\r\n      avoided. A good rope around the neck of all these little females\u2014it\r\n\r\n      is the only way, the only way!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A man entered. Rouletabille recognized the driver of the telega. There\r\n\r\n      were some rapid words between the Chief and the agent. The man closed the\r\n\r\n      shutters of the room, but through the interstices they would be able to\r\n\r\n      see what went on outside. Then the agent left; Koupriane, as he pushed\r\n\r\n      aside the table that was near the window, said to the reporter:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou had better come to the window; my man has just told me the boat is\r\n\r\n      drawing near. You can watch an interesting sight. We are sure that Natacha\r\n\r\n      is still aboard. The yacht, after the explosion at the datcha, took up two\r\n\r\n      men who put off to it in a canoe, and since then it has simply sailed back\r\n\r\n      and forth in the gulf. We have taken our precautions in Finland the same\r\n\r\n      as here and it is here they are going to try to disembark. Keep an eye on\r\n\r\n      them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane was at his post of observation. Evening slowly fell. The sky was\r\n\r\n      growing grayish-black, a tint that blended with the slate-colored sea. To\r\n\r\n      those on the bank, the sound of the men about to die came softly across\r\n\r\n      the water. There was a sail far out. Between the strand and the touba\r\n\r\n      where Koupriane watched, was a ridge, a window, which, however, did not\r\n\r\n      hide the shore or the bay from the prefect of police, because at the\r\n\r\n      height where he was his glance passed at an angle above it. But from the\r\n\r\n      sea this ridge entirely hid anyone who lay in ambush behind it. The\r\n\r\n      reporter watched fifty moujiks flat on their stomachs crawling up the\r\n\r\n      ridge, behind two of their number whose heads alone topped the ridge. In\r\n\r\n      the line of gaze taken by those two heads was the white sail, looming much\r\n\r\n      larger now. The yacht was heeled in the water and glided with real\r\n\r\n      elegance, heading straight on. Suddenly, just when they supposed she was\r\n\r\n      coming straight to shore, the sails fell and a canoe was dropped over the\r\n\r\n      side. Four men got into it; then a woman jumped lightly down a little\r\n\r\n      gangway into the canoe. It was Natacha. Koupriane had no difficulty in\r\n\r\n      recognizing her through the gathering darkness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, my dear Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d said he, \u201csee your prisoner of the\r\n\r\n      Nihilists. Notice how she is bound. Her thongs certainly are causing her\r\n\r\n      great pain. These revolutionaries surely are brutes!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The truth was that Natacha had gone quite readily to the rudder and while\r\n\r\n      the others rowed she steered the light boat to the place on the beach that\r\n\r\n      had been pointed out to her. Soon the prow of the canoe touched the sands.\r\n\r\n      There did not seem to be a soul about, and that was the conclusion the men\r\n\r\n      in the canoe who stood up looking around, seemed to reach. They jumped\r\n\r\n      out, and then it was Natacha\u2019s turn. She accepted the hand held out to\r\n\r\n      her, talking pleasantly with the men all the time. She even turned to\r\n\r\n      press the hand of one of them. The group came up across the beach. All\r\n\r\n      this time the watchers in the little eating-house could see the false\r\n\r\n      moujiks, who had wriggled on their stomachs to the very edge of the ridge,\r\n\r\n      holding themselves ready to spring.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Behind his shutter, Koupriane could not restrain an exclamation of\r\n\r\n      triumph; he gradually identified some of the figures in the group, and\r\n\r\n      muttered:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh! eh! There is Priemkof himself and the others. Gounsovski is right and\r\n\r\n      he certainly is well-informed; his system is decidedly a good one. What a\r\n\r\n      net-full!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He hardly breathed as he watched the outcome. He could discern elsewhere,\r\n\r\n      beside the bay, flat on the ground, concealed by the slightest elevation\r\n\r\n      of the soil, other false moujiks. The wood of Sestroriesk was watched in\r\n\r\n      the same way. The group of revolutionaries who strolled behind Natacha\r\n\r\n      stopped to confer. In three\u2014maybe two\u2014minutes, they would be\r\n\r\n      surrounded\u2014cut off, taken in the trap. Suddenly a gunshot sounded in\r\n\r\n      the night, and the group, with startled speed, turned in their tracks and\r\n\r\n      made silently for the sea, while from all directions poured the concealed\r\n\r\n      agents and threw themselves into the pursuit, jostling each other and\r\n\r\n      crying after the fugitives. But the cries became cries of rage, for the\r\n\r\n      group of revolutionaries gained the beach. They saw Natacha, who was held\r\n\r\n      up by Priemkof himself, reject the aid of the Nihilist, who did not wish\r\n\r\n      to abandon her, in order that he might save himself. She made him go and\r\n\r\n      seeing that she was going to be taken, stopped short and waited for the\r\n\r\n      enemy stoically, with folded arms. Meanwhile, her three companions\r\n\r\n      succeeded in throwing themselves into the canoe and plied the oars hard\r\n\r\n      while Koupriane\u2019s men, in the water up to their chests, discharged their\r\n\r\n      revolvers at the fugitives. The men in the canoe, fearing to wound\r\n\r\n      Natacha, made no reply to the firing. The yacht had sails up by the time\r\n\r\n      they drew alongside, and made off like a bird toward the mysterious fords\r\n\r\n      of Finland, audaciously hoisting the black flag of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Meantime, Koupriane\u2019s agents, trembling before his anger, gathered at the\r\n\r\n      eating-house. The Prefect of Police let his fury loose on them and treated\r\n\r\n      them like the most infamous of animals. The capture of Natacha was little\r\n\r\n      comfort. He had planned for the whole bag, and his men\u2019s stupidity took\r\n\r\n      away all his self-control. If he had had a whip at hand he would have\r\n\r\n      found prompt solace for his mined hopes. Natacha, standing in a corner,\r\n\r\n      with her face singularly calm, watched this extraordinary scene that was\r\n\r\n      like a menagerie in which the tamer himself had become a wild beast. From\r\n\r\n      another corner, Rouletabille kept his eyes fixed on Natacha who ignored\r\n\r\n      him. Ah, that girl, sphinx to them all! Even to him who thought a while\r\n\r\n      ago that he could read things invisible to other vulgar men in her\r\n\r\n      features, in her eyes! The impassive face of that girl whose father they\r\n\r\n      had tried to assassinate only a few hours before and who had just pressed\r\n\r\n      the hand of Priemkof, the assassin! Once she turned her head slightly\r\n\r\n      toward Rouletabille. The reporter then looked towards her with increased\r\n\r\n      eagerness, his eyes burning, as though he would say: \u201cSurely, Natacha, you\r\n\r\n      are not the accomplice of your father\u2019s assassins; surely it was not you\r\n\r\n      who poured the poison!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Natacha\u2019s glance passed the reporter coldly over. Ah, that mysterious,\r\n\r\n      cold mask, the mouth with its bitter, impudent smile, an atrocious smile\r\n\r\n      which seemed to say to the reporter: \u201cIf it is not I who poured the\r\n\r\n      poison, then it is you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was the visage common enough to the daughters whom Koupriane had spoken\r\n\r\n      of a little while before, \u201cthe young girls who read\u201d and, their reading\r\n\r\n      done, set themselves to accomplish some terrible thing, some thing because\r\n\r\n      of which, from time to time, they place stiff ropes around the necks of\r\n\r\n      these young females.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Finally, Koupriane\u2019s frenzy wore itself out and he made a sign. The men\r\n\r\n      filed out in dismal silence. Two of them remained to guard Natacha. From\r\n\r\n      outside came the sounds of a carriage from Sestroriesk ready to convey the\r\n\r\n      girl to the Dungeons of Sts. Peter and Paul. A final gesture from the\r\n\r\n      Prefect of Police and the rough bands of the two guards seized the\r\n\r\n      prisoner\u2019s frail wrists. They hustled her along, thrust her outside,\r\n\r\n      jamming her against the doorway, venting thus their anger at the\r\n\r\n      reproaches of their chief. A few seconds later the carriage departed, not\r\n\r\n      to stop until the fortress was reached with the trickling tombs under the\r\n\r\n      bed of the river where young girls about to die are confined\u2014who\r\n\r\n      have read too much, without entirely understanding, as Monsieur Kropotkine\r\n\r\n      says.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane prepared to leave in turn. Rouletabille stopped him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcellency, I wish you to tell me why you have shown such anger to your\r\n\r\n      men just now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are brute beasts,\u201d cried the Chief of Police, quite beside himself\r\n\r\n      again. \u201cThey have made me miss the biggest catch of my life. They threw\r\n\r\n      themselves on the group two minutes too early. Some of them fired a gun\r\n\r\n      that they took for the signal and that served to warn the Nihilists. But I\r\n\r\n      will let them all rot in prison until I learn which one fired that shot.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou needn\u2019t look far for that,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cI did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou! Then you must have gone outside the touba?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, in order to warn them. But still I was a little late, since you did\r\n\r\n      take Natacha.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Koupriane\u2019s eyes blazed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are their accomplice in all this,\u201d he hurled at the reporter, \u201cand I\r\n\r\n      am going to the Tsar for permission to arrest you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHurry, then, Excellency,\u201d replied the reporter coldly, \u201cbecause the\r\n\r\n      Nihilists, who also think they have a little account to settle with me,\r\n\r\n      may reach me before you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he saluted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XV. \u201cI HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At the hotel a note from Gounsovski: \u201cDon\u2019t forget this time to come\r\n\r\n      to-morrow to have luncheon with me. Warmest regards from Madame\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski.\u201d Then a horrible, sleepless night, shaken with echoes of\r\n\r\n      explosions and the clamor of the wounded; and the solemn shade of Pere\r\n\r\n      Alexis, stretching out toward Rouletabille a phial of poison and saying,\r\n\r\n      \u201cEither Natacha or you!\u201d Then, rising among the shades the bloody form of\r\n\r\n      Michael Nikolaievitch the Innocent!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      In the morning a note from the Marshal of the Court.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur le Marechal had no particular good news, evidently, for in terms\r\n\r\n      quite without enthusiasm he invited the young man to luncheon for that\r\n\r\n      same day, rather early, at midday, as he wished to see him once more\r\n\r\n      before he left for France. \u201cI see,\u201d said Rouletabille to himself;\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur le Marechal pronounces my expulsion from the country\u201d\u2014and\r\n\r\n      he forgot once more the Gounsovski luncheon. The meeting-place named was\r\n\r\n      the great restaurant called the Bear. Rouletabille entered it promptly at\r\n\r\n      noon. He asked the schwitzar if the Grand Marshal of the Court had\r\n\r\n      arrived, and was told no one had seen him yet. They conducted him to the\r\n\r\n      huge main hall, where, however, there was only one person. This man,\r\n\r\n      standing before the table spread with zakouskis, was stuffing himself. At\r\n\r\n      the sound of Rouletabille\u2019s step on the floor this sole famished patron\r\n\r\n      turned and lifted his hands to heaven as he recognized the reporter. The\r\n\r\n      latter would have given all the roubles in his pocket to have avoided the\r\n\r\n      recognition. But he was already face to face with the advocate so\r\n\r\n      celebrated for his table-feats, the amiable Athanase Georgevitch, his head\r\n\r\n      swathed in bandages and dressings from the midst of which one could\r\n\r\n      perceive distinctly only the eyes and, above all, the mouth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow goes it, little friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, I! There is nothing the matter. In a week we shall have forgotten\r\n\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a terrible affair,\u201d said the reporter, \u201cI certainly believed we were\r\n\r\n      all dead men.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no. It was nothing. Nitchevo!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd poor Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff with his two poor legs broken!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEh! Nitchevo! He has plenty of good solid splints that will make him two\r\n\r\n      good legs again. Nitchevo! Don\u2019t you think anything more about that! It is\r\n\r\n      nothing. You have come here to dine? A very celebrated house this.\r\n\r\n      Caracho!\u201d He busied himself to do the honors. One would have said the\r\n\r\n      restaurant belonged to him. He boasted of its architecture and the cuisine\r\n\r\n      \u201ca la Francaise.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you know,\u201d he inquired confidently, \u201ca finer restaurant room anywhere\r\n\r\n      in the world?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      In fact, it seemed to Rouletabille as he looked up into the high glass\r\n\r\n      arch that he was in a railway station decorated for some illustrious\r\n\r\n      traveler, for there were flowers and plants everywhere. But the visitor\r\n\r\n      whom the ball awaited was the Russian eater, the ogre who never failed to\r\n\r\n      come to eat at The Bear. Pointing out the lines of tables shining with\r\n\r\n      their white cloths and bright silver, Athanase Georgevitch, with his mouth\r\n\r\n      full, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, my dear little French monsieur, you should see it at supper-time,\r\n\r\n      with the women, and the jewels, and the music. There is nothing in France\r\n\r\n      that can give you any idea of it, nothing! The gayety\u2014the champagne\u2014and\r\n\r\n      the jewels, monsieur, worth millions and millions of roubles! Our women\r\n\r\n      wear them all\u2014everything they have. They are decked like sacred\r\n\r\n      shrines! All the family jewels\u2014from the very bottom of the caskets!\r\n\r\n      it is magnificent, thoroughly Russian\u2014Muscovite! What am I saying?\r\n\r\n      It is Asiatic. Monsieur, in the evening, at a fete, we are Asiatic. Let me\r\n\r\n      tell you something on the quiet. You notice that this enormous dining hall\r\n\r\n      is surrounded by those windowed balconies. Each of those windows belongs\r\n\r\n      to a separate private room. Well, you see that window there?\u2014yes,\r\n\r\n      there\u2014that is the room of a grand duke\u2014yes, he\u2019s the one I\r\n\r\n      mean\u2014a very gay grand duke. Do you know, one evening when there was\r\n\r\n      a great crowd here\u2014families, monsieur, family parties, high-born\r\n\r\n      families\u2014the window of that particular balcony was thrown open, and\r\n\r\n      a woman stark naked, as naked as my hand, monsieur, was dropped into the\r\n\r\n      dining-hall and ran across it full-speed. It was a wager, monsieur, a\r\n\r\n      wager of the jolly grand duke\u2019s, and the demoiselle won it. But what a\r\n\r\n      scandal! Ah, don\u2019t speak of it; that would be very bad form. But\u2014sufficiently\r\n\r\n      Asiatic, eh? Truly Asiatic. And\u2014something much more unfortunate\u2014you\r\n\r\n      see that table? It happened the Russian New Year Eve, at supper. All the\r\n\r\n      beauty, the whole capital, was here. Just at midnight the orchestra struck\r\n\r\n      up the Bodje tsara krani* to inaugurate the joyful Russian New Year, and\r\n\r\n      everybody stood up, according to custom, and listened in silence, as loyal\r\n\r\n      subjects should. Well, at that table, accompanying his family, there was a\r\n\r\n      young student, a fine fellow, very correct, and in uniform. This unhappy\r\n\r\n      young student, who had risen like everybody else, to listen to the Bodje\r\n\r\n      tsara krani, inadvertently placed his knee on a chair. Truly that is not a\r\n\r\n      correct attitude, monsieur, but really it was no reason for killing him,\r\n\r\n      was it now? Certainly not. Well, a brute in uniform, an officer quite\r\n\r\n      immaculately gotten-up, drew a revolver from his pocket and discharged it\r\n\r\n      at the student point-blank. You can imagine the scandal, for the student\r\n\r\n      was dead! There were Paris journalists there, besides, who had never been\r\n\r\n      there before, you see! Monsieur Gaston Leroux was at that very table. What\r\n\r\n      a scandal! They had a regular battle. They broke carafes over the head of\r\n\r\n      the assassin\u2014for he was neither more nor less than an assassin, a\r\n\r\n      drinker of blood\u2014an Asiatic. They picked up the assassin, who was\r\n\r\n      bleeding all over, and carried him off to look after him. As to the dead\r\n\r\n      man, he lay stretched out there under a table-cloth, waiting for the\r\n\r\n      police\u2014and those at the tables went on with their drinking. Isn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      that Asiatic enough for you? Here, a naked woman; there, a corpse! And the\r\n\r\n      jewels\u2014and the champagne! What do you say to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis Excellency the Grand Marshal of the Court is waiting for you,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille shook hands with Athanase Georgevitch, who returned to his\r\n\r\n      zakouskis, and followed the interpreter to the door of one of the private\r\n\r\n      rooms. The high dignitary was there. With a charm in his politeness of\r\n\r\n      which the high-born Russian possesses the secret over almost everybody\r\n\r\n      else in the world, the Marshal intimated to Rouletabille that he had\r\n\r\n      incurred imperial displeasure.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have been denounced by Koupriane, who holds you responsible for the\r\n\r\n      checks he has suffered in this affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Koupriane is right,\u201d replied Rouletabille, \u201cand His Majesty\r\n\r\n      should believe him, since it is the truth. But don\u2019t fear anything from\r\n\r\n      me, Monsieur le Grand Marechal, for I shall not inconvenience Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Koupriane any further, nor anybody else. I shall disappear.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe Koupriane is already directed to vise your passport.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is very good, and he does himself much harm.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll that is a little your fault, Monsieur Rouletabille. We believed we\r\n\r\n      could consider you as a friend, and you have never failed, it appears, on\r\n\r\n      each occasion to give your help to our enemies.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho says that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cKoupriane. Oh, it is necessary to be one with us. And you are not one\r\n\r\n      with us. And if you are not for us you are against us. You understand\r\n\r\n      that, I think. That is the way it has to be. The Terrorists have returned\r\n\r\n      to the methods of the Nihilists, who succeeded altogether too well against\r\n\r\n      Alexander II. When I tell you that they succeeded in placing their\r\n\r\n      messages even in the imperial palace...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Rouletabille, vaguely, as though he were already far\r\n\r\n      removed from the contingencies of this world. \u201cI know that Czar Alexander\r\n\r\n      II sometimes found under his napkin a letter announcing his condemnation\r\n\r\n      to death.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, at the Chateau yesterday morning something happened that is\r\n\r\n      perhaps more alarming than the letter found by Alexander II under his\r\n\r\n      napkin.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat can it be? Have bombs been discovered?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo. It is a bizarre occurrence and almost unbelievable. The eider downs,\r\n\r\n      all the eider down coverings belonging to the imperial family disappeared\r\n\r\n      yesterday morning.\u201d *\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSurely not!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is just as I say. And it was impossible to learn what had become of\r\n\r\n      them\u2014until yesterday evening, when they were found again in their\r\n\r\n      proper places in the chambers. That is the new mystery!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCertainly. But how were they taken out?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShall we ever know? All we found was two feathers, this morning, in the\r\n\r\n      boudoir of the Empress, which leads us to think that the eider downs were\r\n\r\n      taken out that way. I am taking the two feathers to Koupriane.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet me see them,\u201d asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked them over and handed them back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what do you think the whole affair means?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are inclined to regard it as a threat by the revolutionaries. If they\r\n\r\n      can carry away the eider downs, it would be quite as easy for them to\r\n\r\n      carry away...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Imperial family? No, I don\u2019t think it is that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI? Nothing any more. Not only do I not think any more, but I don\u2019t wish\r\n\r\n      to. Tell me, Monsieur le Grand Marechal, it is useless, I suppose, to try\r\n\r\n      to see His Majesty before I go?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat good would it do, monsieur? We know everything now. This Natacha\r\n\r\n      that you defended against Koupriane is proved the culprit. The last affair\r\n\r\n      does not leave that in any reasonable doubt. And she is taken care of from\r\n\r\n      this time on. His Majesty wishes never to hear Natacha spoken of again\r\n\r\n      under any pretext.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what are you going to do with that young girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Tsar has decided that there shall not be any trial and that the\r\n\r\n      daughter of General Trebassof shall be sent, by administrative order, to\r\n\r\n      Siberia. The Tsar, monsieur, is very good, for he might have had her\r\n\r\n      hanged. She deserved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, the Tsar is very good.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are very absorbed, Monsieur Rouletabille, and you are not eating.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no appetite, Monsieur le Marechal. Tell me,\u2014the Emperor must\r\n\r\n      be rather bored at Tsarskoie-Coelo?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, he has plenty of work. He rises at seven o\u2019clock and has a light\r\n\r\n      English luncheon\u2014tea and toast. At eight o\u2019clock he starts and works\r\n\r\n      till ten. From ten to eleven he promenades.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the jail-yard?\u201d asked Rouletabille innocently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat\u2019s that you say? Ah, you are an enfant terrible! Certainly we do well\r\n\r\n      to send you away. Until eleven he promenades in a pathway of the park.\r\n\r\n      From eleven to one he holds audience; luncheon at one; then he spends the\r\n\r\n      time until half-past two with his family.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does he eat?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSoup. His Majesty is wonderfully fond of soup. He takes it at every meal.\r\n\r\n      After luncheon he smokes, but never a cigar\u2014always cigarettes, gifts\r\n\r\n      of the Sultan; and he only drinks one liqueur, Maraschino. At half-past\r\n\r\n      two he goes out again for a little air\u2014always in his park; then he\r\n\r\n      sets himself to work until eight o\u2019clock. It is simply frightful work,\r\n\r\n      with heaps of useless papers and numberless signatures. No secretary can\r\n\r\n      spare him that ungrateful bureaucratic duty. He must sign, sign, sign, and\r\n\r\n      read, read, read the reports. And it is work without any beginning or end;\r\n\r\n      as soon as some reports go, others arrive. At eight o\u2019clock, dinner, and\r\n\r\n      then more signatures, working right up to eleven o\u2019clock. At eleven\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock he goes to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd he sleeps to the rhythmical tramp of the guards on patrol,\u201d added\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, bluntly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cO young man, young man!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon me, Monsieur le Grand Marechal,\u201d said the reporter, rising; \u201cI am,\r\n\r\n      indeed, a disturbing spirit and I know that I have nothing more to do in\r\n\r\n      this country. You will not see me any more, Monsieur le Grand Marechal;\r\n\r\n      but before leaving I ought to tell you how much I have been touched by the\r\n\r\n      hospitality of your great nation. That hospitality is sometimes a little\r\n\r\n      dangerous, but it is always magnificent. No other nation in the world\r\n\r\n      knows like the Russians how to receive a man, Your Excellency. I speak as\r\n\r\n      I feel; and that isn\u2019t affected by my manner of quitting you, for you know\r\n\r\n      also how to put a man to the door. Adieu, then; without any rancor. My\r\n\r\n      most respectful homage to His Majesty. Ah, just one word more! You will\r\n\r\n      recall that Natacha Feodorovna was engaged to poor Boris Mourazoff, still\r\n\r\n      another young man who has disappeared and who, before disappearing,\r\n\r\n      charged me to deliver to General Trebassof\u2019s daughter this last token\u2014these\r\n\r\n      two little ikons. I entrust you with this mission, Monsieur le Grand\r\n\r\n      Marechal. Your servant, Excellency.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille re-descended the great Kaniouche. \u201cNow,\u201d said he to himself,\r\n\r\n      \u201cit is my turn to buy farewell presents.\u201d And he made his way slowly\r\n\r\n      across la Place des Grandes-Ecuries and the bridge of the Katharine canal.\r\n\r\n      He entered Aptiekarski-Pereoulok and pushed open Pere Alexis\u2019s door, under\r\n\r\n      the arch, at the back of the obscure court.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHealth and prosperity, Alexis Hutch!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, you again, little man! Well? Koupriane has let you know the result of\r\n\r\n      my analyses?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes. Tell me, Alexis Hutch, you are sure you are not mistaken? You\r\n\r\n      don\u2019t think you might be mistaken? Think carefully before you answer. It\r\n\r\n      is a question of life or death.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor you, good little friend! You want to make your old Pere Alexis laugh\u2014or\r\n\r\n      weep!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnswer me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t be mistaken. The thing is as certain as that we two are\r\n\r\n      here\u2014arsenate of soda in the stains on the two napkins and traces of\r\n\r\n      arsenate of soda in two of the four glasses; none in the carafe, none in\r\n\r\n      the little bottle, none in the two glasses. I say it before you and before\r\n\r\n      God.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo it is really true. Thank you, Alexis Hutch. Koupriane has not tried to\r\n\r\n      deceive me. There has been nothing of that sort. Well, do you know, Alexis\r\n\r\n      Hutch, who has poured the poison? It is she or I. And as it is not I, it\r\n\r\n      is she. And since it is she, well, I am going to die!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou love her, then?\u201d inquired Pere Alexis.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied Rouletabille, with a self-mocking smile. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t love\r\n\r\n      her. But if it is she who poured the poison, then it was not Michael\r\n\r\n      Nikolaievitch, and it is I who had Michael Nikolaievitch killed. You can\r\n\r\n      see now that therefore I must die. Show me your finest images.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, my little one, if you will permit your old Alexis to make you a gift,\r\n\r\n      I would offer you these two poor ikons that are certainly from the convent\r\n\r\n      of Troitza at its best period. See how beautiful they are, and old. Have\r\n\r\n      you ever seen so beautiful a Mother of God? And this St. Luke, would you\r\n\r\n      believe that the hand had been mended, eh? Two little masterpieces, little\r\n\r\n      friend! If the old masters of Salonika returned to the world they would be\r\n\r\n      satisfied with their pupils at Troitza. But you mustn\u2019t kill yourself at\r\n\r\n      your age!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome, bat ouclzka (little father), I accept your gift, and, if I meet the\r\n\r\n      old Salonican masters on the road I am going to travel, I shan\u2019t fail to\r\n\r\n      tell them there is no person here below who appreciates them like a\r\n\r\n      certain pere of Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, Alexis Hutch.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      So saying Rouletabille wrapped up the two little ikons and put them in his\r\n\r\n      pocket. The Saint Luke would be sure to appeal to his friend Sainclair. As\r\n\r\n      to the Mother of God, that would be his dying gift to the Dame en noir.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, you are sad, little son; and your voice, as it sounds now, hurts me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille turned his head at the sound of two moujiks who entered,\r\n\r\n      carrying a long basket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d demanded Pere Alexis in Russian, \u201cand what is that you\r\n\r\n      are bringing in? Do you intend to fill that huge basket with my goods? In\r\n\r\n      that case you are very welcome and I am your humble servant.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the two chuckled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, we have come to rid your shop of a wretched piece of goods that\r\n\r\n      litters it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is this you say?\u201d inquired the old man, anxiously, and drawing near\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille. \u201cLittle friend, watch these men; I don\u2019t recognize their\r\n\r\n      faces and I can\u2019t understand why they have come here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at the new-comers, who drew near the counter, after\r\n\r\n      depositing their long basket close to the door. There was a sarcastic and\r\n\r\n      malicious mocking way about them that struck him from the first. But while\r\n\r\n      they kept up their jabbering with Pere Alexis he filled his pipe and\r\n\r\n      proceeded to light it. Just then the door was pushed open again and three\r\n\r\n      men entered, simply dressed, like respectable small merchants. They also\r\n\r\n      acted curiously and looked all around the shop. Pere Alexis grew more and\r\n\r\n      more alarmed and the others pulled rudely at his beard.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe these men here have come to rob me,\u201d he cried in French. \u201cWhat\r\n\r\n      do you say, my son?\u2014Shall I call the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHold on,\u201d replied Rouletabille impassively. \u201cThey are all armed; they\r\n\r\n      have revolvers in their pockets.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Pere Alexis\u2019s teeth commenced to chatter. As he tried to get near the door\r\n\r\n      he was roughly pushed back and a final personage entered, apparently a\r\n\r\n      gentleman, and dressed as such, save that he wore a visored leather cap.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u201d said he at once in French, \u201cwhy, it is the young French journalist\r\n\r\n      of the Grand-Morskaia Hotel. Salutations and your good health! I see with\r\n\r\n      pleasure that you also appreciate the counsels of our dear Pere Alexis.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, little friend; I don\u2019t know him,\u201d cried Alexis\r\n\r\n      Hutch.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the gentleman of the Neva went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is a man close to the first principles of science, and therefore not\r\n\r\n      far from divine; he is a holy man, whom it is good to consult at moments\r\n\r\n      when the future appears difficult. He knows how to read as no one else can\u2014Father\r\n\r\n      John of Cronstadt excepted, to be strictly accurate\u2014on the sheets of\r\n\r\n      bull-hide where the dark angels have traced mysterious signs of destiny.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the gentleman picked up an old pair of boots, which he threw on the\r\n\r\n      counter in the midst of the ikons.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPere Alexis, perhaps these are not bull-hide, but good enough cow-hide.\r\n\r\n      Don\u2019t you want to read on this cow-hide the future of this young man?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But here Rouletabille advanced to the gentleman, and blew an enormous\r\n\r\n      cloud of smoke full in his face.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is useless, monsieur,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cto waste your time and your\r\n\r\n      breath. I have been waiting for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XVI. BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Only, Rouletabille refused to be put into the basket. He would not let\r\n\r\n      them disarm him until they promised to call a carriage. The Vehicle rolled\r\n\r\n      into the court, and while Pere Alexis was kept back in his shop at the\r\n\r\n      point of a revolver, Rouletabille quietly got in, smoking his pipe. The\r\n\r\n      man who appeared to be the chief of the band (the gentleman of the Neva)\r\n\r\n      got in too and sat down beside him. The carriage windows were shuttered,\r\n\r\n      preventing all communication with the outside, and only a tiny lantern\r\n\r\n      lighted the interior. They started. The carriage was driven by two men in\r\n\r\n      brown coats trimmed with false astrakhan. The dvornicks saluted, believing\r\n\r\n      it a police affair. The concierge made the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The journey lasted several hours without other incidents than those\r\n\r\n      brought about by the tremendous jolts, which threw the two passengers\r\n\r\n      inside one on top of the other. This might have made an opening for\r\n\r\n      conversation; and the \u201cgentleman of the Neva\u201d tried it; but in vain.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille would not respond. At one moment, indeed, the gentleman, who\r\n\r\n      was growing bored, became so pressing that the reporter finally said in\r\n\r\n      the curt tone he always used when he was irritated:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI pray you, monsieur, let me smoke my pipe in peace.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Upon which the gentleman prudently occupied himself in lowering one of the\r\n\r\n      windows, for it grew stifling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Finally, after much jolting, there was a stop while the horses were\r\n\r\n      changed and the gentleman asked Rouletabille to let himself be\r\n\r\n      blindfolded. \u201cThe moment has come; they are going to hang me without any\r\n\r\n      form of trial,\u201d thought the reporter, and when, blinded with the bandage,\r\n\r\n      he felt himself lifted under the arms, there was revolt of his whole\r\n\r\n      being, that being which, now that it was on the point of dying, did not\r\n\r\n      wish to cease. Rouletabille would have believed himself stronger, more\r\n\r\n      courageous, more stoical at least. But blind instinct swept all of this\r\n\r\n      away, that instinct of conservation which had no concern with the minor\r\n\r\n      bravadoes of the reporter, no concern with the fine heroic manner, of the\r\n\r\n      determined pose to die finely, because the instinct of conservation, which\r\n\r\n      is, as its rigid name indicates, essentially materialistic, demands only,\r\n\r\n      thinks of nothing but, to live. And it was that instinct which made\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s last pipe die out unpuffed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The young man was furious with himself, and he grew pale with the fear\r\n\r\n      that he might not succeed in mastering this emotion, he took fierce hold\r\n\r\n      of himself and his members, which had stiffened at the contact of seizure\r\n\r\n      by rough hands, relaxed, and he allowed himself to be led. Truly, he was\r\n\r\n      disgusted with his faintness and weakness. He had seen men die who knew\r\n\r\n      they were going to die. His task as reporter had led him more than once to\r\n\r\n      the foot of the guillotine. And the wretches he had seen there had died\r\n\r\n      bravely. Extraordinarily enough, the most criminal had ordinarily met\r\n\r\n      death most bravely. Of course, they had had leisure to prepare themselves,\r\n\r\n      thinking a long time in advance of that supreme moment. But they affronted\r\n\r\n      death, came to it almost negligently, found strength even to say banal or\r\n\r\n      taunting things to those around them. He recalled above all a boy of\r\n\r\n      eighteen years old who had cowardly murdered an old woman and two children\r\n\r\n      in a back-country farm, and had walked to his death without a tremor,\r\n\r\n      talking reassuringly to the priest and the police official, who walked\r\n\r\n      almost sick with horror on either side of him. Could he, then, not be as\r\n\r\n      brave as that child?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They made him mount some steps and he felt that he had entered the stuffy\r\n\r\n      atmosphere of a closed room. Then someone removed the bandage. He was in a\r\n\r\n      room of sinister aspect and in the midst of a rather large company.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Within these naked, neglected walls there were about thirty young men,\r\n\r\n      some of them apparently quite as young as Rouletabille, with candid blue\r\n\r\n      eyes and pale complexions. The others, older men, were of the physical\r\n\r\n      type of Christs, not the animated Christs of Occidental painters, but\r\n\r\n      those that are seen on the panels of the Byzantine school or fastened on\r\n\r\n      the ikons, sculptures of silver or gold. Their long hair, deeply parted in\r\n\r\n      the middle, fell upon their shoulders in curl-tipped golden masses. Some\r\n\r\n      leant against the wall, erect, and motionless. Others were seated on the\r\n\r\n      floor, their legs crossed. Most of them were in winter coats, bought in\r\n\r\n      the bazaars. But there were also men from the country, with their skins of\r\n\r\n      beasts, their sayons, their touloupes. One of them had his legs laced\r\n\r\n      about with cords and was shod with twined willow twigs. The contrast\r\n\r\n      afforded by various ones of these grave and attentive figures showed that\r\n\r\n      representatives from the entire revolutionary party were present. At the\r\n\r\n      back of the room, behind a table, three young men were seated, and the\r\n\r\n      oldest of them was not more than twenty-five and had the benign beauty of\r\n\r\n      Jesus on feast-days, canopied by consecrated palms.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      In the center of the room a small table stood, quite bare and without any\r\n\r\n      apparent purpose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the right was another table with paper, pens and ink-stands. It was\r\n\r\n      there that Rouletabille was conducted and asked to be seated. Then he saw\r\n\r\n      that another man was at his side, who was required to keep standing. His\r\n\r\n      face was pale and desperate, very drawn. His eyes burned somberly, in\r\n\r\n      spite of the panic that deformed his features Rouletabille recognized one\r\n\r\n      of the unintroduced friends whom Gounsovski had brought with him to the\r\n\r\n      supper at Krestowsky. Evidently since then the always-threatening\r\n\r\n      misfortune had fallen upon him. They were proceeding with his trial. The\r\n\r\n      one who seemed to preside over these strange sessions pronounced a name:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnnouchka!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A door opened, and Annouchka appeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille hardly recognized her, she was so strangely dressed, like the\r\n\r\n      Russian poor, with her under-jacket of red-flannel and the handkerchief\r\n\r\n      which, knotted under her chin, covered all her beautiful hair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She immediately testified in Russian against the man, who protested until\r\n\r\n      they compelled him to be silent. She drew from her pocket papers which\r\n\r\n      were read aloud, and which appeared to crush the accused. He fell back\r\n\r\n      onto his seat. He shivered. He hid his head in his hands, and Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      saw the hands tremble. The man kept that position while the other\r\n\r\n      witnesses were heard, their testimony arousing murmurs of indignation that\r\n\r\n      were quickly checked. Annouchka had gone to take her place with the others\r\n\r\n      against the wall, in the shadows which more and more invaded the room, at\r\n\r\n      this ending of a lugubrious day. Two windows reaching to the floor let a\r\n\r\n      wan light creep with difficulty through their dirty panes, making a vague\r\n\r\n      twilight in the room. Soon nothing could be seen of the motionless figures\r\n\r\n      against the wall, much as the faces fade in the frescoes from which the\r\n\r\n      centuries have effaced the colors in the depths of orthodox convents.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Now someone from the depths of the shadow and the appalling silence read\r\n\r\n      something; the verdict, doubtless.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The voice ceased.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then some of the figures detached themselves from the wall and advanced.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The man who crouched near Rouletabille rose in a savage bound and cried\r\n\r\n      out rapidly, wild words, supplicating words, menacing words.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And then\u2014nothing more but strangling gasps. The figures that had\r\n\r\n      moved out from the wall had clutched his throat.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter said, \u201cIt is cowardly.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Annouchka\u2019s voice, low, from the depths of shadow, replied, \u201cIt is just.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Rouletabille was satisfied with having said that, for he had proved to\r\n\r\n      himself that he could still speak. His emotion had been such, since they\r\n\r\n      had pushed him into the center of this sinister and expeditious\r\n\r\n      revolutionary assembly of justice, that he thought of nothing but the\r\n\r\n      terror of not being able to speak to them, to say something to them, no\r\n\r\n      matter what, which would prove to them that he had no fear. Well, that was\r\n\r\n      over. He had not failed to say, \u201cThat is cowardly.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he crossed his arms. But he soon had to turn away his head in order\r\n\r\n      not to see the use the table was put to that stood in the center of the\r\n\r\n      room, where it had seemed to serve no purpose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They had lifted the man, still struggling, up onto the little table. They\r\n\r\n      placed a rope about his neck. Then one of the \u201cjudges,\u201d one of the blond\r\n\r\n      young men, who seemed no older than Rouletabille, climbed on the table and\r\n\r\n      slipped the other end of the rope through a great ring-bolt that projected\r\n\r\n      from a beam of the ceiling. During this time the man struggled futilely,\r\n\r\n      and his death-rattle rose at last though the continued noise of his\r\n\r\n      resistance and its overcoming. But his last breath came with so violent a\r\n\r\n      shake of the body that the whole death-apparatus, rope and ring-bolt,\r\n\r\n      separated from the ceiling, and rolled to the ground with the dead man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille uttered a cry of horror. \u201cYou are assassins!\u201d he cried. But\r\n\r\n      was the man surely dead? It was this that the pale figures with the yellow\r\n\r\n      hair set themselves to make sure of. He was. Then they brought two sacks\r\n\r\n      and the dead man was slipped into one of them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille said to them:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are braver when you kill by an explosion, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He regretted bitterly that he had not died the night before in the\r\n\r\n      explosion. He did not feel very brave. He talked to them bravely enough,\r\n\r\n      but he trembled as his time approached. That death horrified him. He tried\r\n\r\n      to keep from looking at the other sack. He took the two ikons, of Saint\r\n\r\n      Luke and of the Virgin, from his pocket and prayed to them. He thought of\r\n\r\n      the Lady in Black and wept.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      A voice in the shadows said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is crying, the poor little fellow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was Annouchka\u2019s voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille dried his tears and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMessieurs, one of you must have a mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But all the voices cried:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no, we have mothers no more!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have killed them,\u201d cried some. \u201cThey have sent them to Siberia,\u201d\r\n\r\n       cried others.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I have a mother still,\u201d said the poor lad. \u201cI will not have the\r\n\r\n      opportunity to embrace her. It is a mother that I lost the day of my birth\r\n\r\n      and that I have found again, but\u2014I suppose it is to be said\u2014on\r\n\r\n      the day of my death. I shall not see her again. I have a friend; I shall\r\n\r\n      not see him again either. I have two little ikons here for them, and I am\r\n\r\n      going to write a letter to each of them, if you will permit it. Swear to\r\n\r\n      me that you will see these reach them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI swear it,\u201d said, in French, the voice of Annouchka.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThanks, madame, you are kind. And now, messieurs, that is all I ask of\r\n\r\n      you. I know I am here to reply to very grave accusations. Permit me to say\r\n\r\n      to you at once that I admit them all to be well founded. Consequently,\r\n\r\n      there need be no discussion between us. I have deserved death and I accept\r\n\r\n      it. So permit me not to concern myself with what will be going on here. I\r\n\r\n      ask of you simply, as a last favor, not to hasten your preparations too\r\n\r\n      much, so that I may be able to finish my letters.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Upon which, satisfied with himself this time, he sat down again and\r\n\r\n      commenced to write rapidly. They left him in peace, as he desired. He did\r\n\r\n      not raise his head once, even at the moment when a murmur louder than\r\n\r\n      usual showed that the hearers regarded Rouletabille\u2019s crimes with especial\r\n\r\n      detestation. He had the happiness of having entirely completed his\r\n\r\n      correspondence when they asked him to rise to hear judgment pronounced\r\n\r\n      upon him. The supreme communion that he had just had with his friend\r\n\r\n      Sainclair and with the dear Lady in Black restored all his spirit to him.\r\n\r\n      He listened respectfully to the sentence which condemned him to death,\r\n\r\n      though he was busy sliding his tongue along the gummed edge of his\r\n\r\n      envelope.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was a list longer than was needed for his doom. Rouletabille kissed his\r\n\r\n      ikons and handed them to Annouchka along with the letters. Then he\r\n\r\n      declared, with his lips trembling slightly, and a cold sweat on his\r\n\r\n      forehead, that he was ready to submit to his fate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XVII. THE LAST CRAVAT\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The gentleman of the Neva said to him: \u201cIf you have nothing further to\r\n\r\n      say, we will go into the courtyard.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille understood at last that hanging him in the room where\r\n\r\n      judgment had been pronounced was rendered impossible by the violence of\r\n\r\n      the prisoner just executed. Not only the rope and the ring-bolt had been\r\n\r\n      torn away, but part of the beam had splintered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is nothing more,\u201d replied Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He was mistaken. Something occurred to him, an idea flashed so suddenly\r\n\r\n      that he became white as his shirt, and had to lean on the arm of the\r\n\r\n      gentleman of the Neva in order to accompany him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The door was open. All the men who had voted his death filed out in gloomy\r\n\r\n      silence. The gentleman of the Neva, who seemed charged with the last\r\n\r\n      offices for the prisoner, pushed him gently out into the court.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was vast, and surrounded by a high board wall; some small buildings,\r\n\r\n      with closed doors, stood to right and left. A high chimney, partially\r\n\r\n      demolished, rose from one corner. Rouletabille decided the whole place was\r\n\r\n      part of some old abandoned mill. Above his head the sky was pale as a\r\n\r\n      winding sheet. A thunderous, intermittent, rhythmical noise appraised him\r\n\r\n      that he could not be far from the sea.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He had plenty of time to note all these things, for they had stopped the\r\n\r\n      march to execution a moment and had made him sit down in the open\r\n\r\n      courtyard on an old box. A few steps away from him under the shed where he\r\n\r\n      certainly was going to be hanged, a man got upon a stool (the stool that\r\n\r\n      would serve Rouletabille a few moments later) with his arm raised, and\r\n\r\n      drove with a few blows of a mallet a great ring-bolt into a beam above his\r\n\r\n      head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter\u2019s eyes, which had not lost their habit of taking everything\r\n\r\n      in, rested again on a coarse canvas sack that lay on the ground. The young\r\n\r\n      man felt a slight tremor, for he saw quickly that the sack swathed a human\r\n\r\n      form. He turned his head away, but only to confront another empty sack\r\n\r\n      that was intended for him. Then he closed his eyes. The sound of music\r\n\r\n      came from somewhere outside, notes of the balalaika. He said to himself,\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, we certainly are in Finland\u201d; for he knew that, if the guzla is\r\n\r\n      Russian the balalaika certainly is Finnish. It is a kind of accordeon that\r\n\r\n      the peasants pick plaintively in the doorways of their toubas. He had seen\r\n\r\n      and heard them the afternoon that he went to Pergalovo, and also a little\r\n\r\n      further away, on the Viborg line. He pictured to himself the ruined\r\n\r\n      structure where he now found himself shut in with the revolutionary\r\n\r\n      tribunal, as it must appear from the outside to passers-by; unsinister,\r\n\r\n      like many others near it, sheltering under its decaying roof a few homes\r\n\r\n      of humble workers, resting now as they played the balalaika at their\r\n\r\n      thresholds, with the day\u2019s labor over.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And suddenly from the ineffable peace of his last evening, while the\r\n\r\n      balalaika mourned and the man overhead tested the solidity of his\r\n\r\n      ring-bolt, a voice outside, the grave, deep voice of Annouchka, sang for\r\n\r\n      the little Frenchman:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille listened to the voice dying away with the last sob of the\r\n\r\n      balalaika. \u201cIt is too sad,\u201d he said, rising. \u201cLet us go,\u201d and he wavered a\r\n\r\n      little.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They came to search him. All was ready above. They pushed him gently\r\n\r\n      towards the shed. When he was under the ring-bolt, near the stool, they\r\n\r\n      made him turn round and they read him something in Russian, doubtless less\r\n\r\n      for him than for those there who did not understand French. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      had hard work to hold himself erect.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The gentleman of the Neva said to him further:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, we now read you the final formula. It asks you to say whether,\r\n\r\n      before you die, you have anything you wish to add to what we know\r\n\r\n      concerning the sentence which has been passed upon you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille thought that his saliva, which at that moment he had the\r\n\r\n      greatest difficulty in swallowing, would not permit him to utter a word.\r\n\r\n      But disdain of such a weakness, when he recalled the coolness of so many\r\n\r\n      illustrious condemned people in their last moments, brought him the last\r\n\r\n      strength needed to maintain his reputation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy,\u201d said he, \u201cthis sentence is not wrongly drawn up. I blame it only\r\n\r\n      for being too short. Why has there been no mention of the crime I\r\n\r\n      committed in contriving the tragic death of poor Michael Korsakoff?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMichael Korsakoff was a wretch,\u201d pronounced the vindictive voice of the\r\n\r\n      young man who had presided at the trial and who, at this supreme moment,\r\n\r\n      happened to be face to face with Rouletabille. \u201cKoupriane\u2019s police, by\r\n\r\n      killing that man, ridded us of a traitor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille uttered a cry, a cry of joy, and while he had some reason for\r\n\r\n      believing that at the point he had reached now of his too-short career\r\n\r\n      only misfortune could befall him, yet here Providence, in his infinite\r\n\r\n      grace, sent him before he died this ineffable consolation: the certainty\r\n\r\n      that he had not been mistaken.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon, pardon,\u201d he murmured, in an excess of joy which stifled him\r\n\r\n      almost as much as the wretched rope would shortly do that they were\r\n\r\n      getting ready behind him. \u201cPardon. One second yet, one little second.\r\n\r\n      Then, messieurs, then, we are agreed in that, are we? This Michael,\r\n\r\n      Michael Nikolaievitch was the the last of traitors.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe first,\u201d said the heavy voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is the same thing, my dear monsieur. A traitor, a wretched traitor,\u201d\r\n\r\n       continued Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA poisoner,\u201d replied the voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA vulgar poisoner! Is that not so? But, tell me how\u2014a vulgar\r\n\r\n      poisoner who, under cover of Nihilism, worked for his own petty ends,\r\n\r\n      worked for himself and betrayed you all!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Now Rouletabille\u2019s voice rose like a fanfare. Someone said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe did not deceive us long; our enemies themselves undertook his\r\n\r\n      punishment.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was I,\u201d cried Rouletabille, radiant again. \u201cIt was I who wound up that\r\n\r\n      career. I tell you that was managed right. It was I who rid you of him.\r\n\r\n      Ah, I knew well enough, messieurs, in the bottom of my heart I knew that I\r\n\r\n      could not be mistaken. Two and two make four always, don\u2019t they? And\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille is always Rouletabille. Messieurs, it is all right, after\r\n\r\n      all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But it was probable that it was also all wrong, for the gentleman of the\r\n\r\n      Neva came up to him hat in hand and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, you know now why the witnesses at your trial did not raise a\r\n\r\n      fact against you that, on the contrary, was entirely in your favor. Now it\r\n\r\n      only remains for us to execute the sentence which is entirely justified on\r\n\r\n      other grounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, but\u2014wait a little. What the devil! Now that I am sure I have\r\n\r\n      not been mistaken and that I have been myself, Rouletabille, all the time\r\n\r\n      I cling to life a little\u2014oh, very much!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A hostile murmur showed the condemned man that the patience of his judges\r\n\r\n      was getting near its limit.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d interposed the president, \u201cwe know that you do not belong to\r\n\r\n      the orthodox religion; nevertheless, we will bring a priest if you wish\r\n\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes, that is it, go for the priest,\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he said to himself, \u201cIt is so much time gained.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      One of the revolutionaries started over to a little cabin that had been\r\n\r\n      transformed into a chapel, while the rest of them looked at the reporter\r\n\r\n      with a good deal less sympathy than they had been showing. If his bravado\r\n\r\n      had impressed them agreeably in the trial room, they were beginning to be\r\n\r\n      rather disgusted by his cries, his protestations and all the maneuvers by\r\n\r\n      which he so apparently was trying to hold off the hour of his death.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But all at once Rouletabille jumped up onto the fatal stool. They believed\r\n\r\n      he had decided finally to make an end of the comedy and die with dignity;\r\n\r\n      but he had mounted there only to give them a discourse.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMessieurs, understand me now. If it is true that you are not suppressing\r\n\r\n      me in order to avenge Michael Nikolaievitch, then why do you hang me? Why\r\n\r\n      do you inflict this odious punishment on me? Because you accuse me of\r\n\r\n      causing Natacha Feodorovna\u2019s arrest? Truly I have been awkward. Of that,\r\n\r\n      and that alone, I accuse myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was you, with your revolver, who gave the signal to Koupriane\u2019s\r\n\r\n      agents! You have done the dirty work for the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille tried vainly to protest, to explain, to say that his revolver\r\n\r\n      shot, on the contrary, had saved the revolutionaries. But no one cared to\r\n\r\n      listen and no one believed him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere is the priest, monsieur,\u201d said the gentleman of the Neva.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOne second! These are my last words, and I swear to you that after this I\r\n\r\n      will pass the rope about my neck myself! But listen to me! Listen to me\r\n\r\n      closely! Natacha Feodorovna was the most precious recruit you had, was she\r\n\r\n      not?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA veritable treasure,\u201d declared the president, his voice more and more\r\n\r\n      impatient.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was a terrible blow, then,\u201d continued the reporter, \u201ca terrible blow\r\n\r\n      for you, this arrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTerrible,\u201d some of them ejaculated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo not interrupt me! Very well, then, I am going to say this to you: \u2018If\r\n\r\n      I ward off this blow\u2014if, after having been the unintentional cause\r\n\r\n      of Natacha\u2019s arrest, I have the daughter of General Trebassof set at\r\n\r\n      liberty, and that within twenty-four hours,\u2014what do you say? Would\r\n\r\n      you still hang me?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The president, he who had the Christ-like countenance, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMessieurs, Natacha Feodorovna has fallen the victim of terrible\r\n\r\n      machinations whose mystery we so far have not been able to penetrate. She\r\n\r\n      is accused of trying to poison her father and her step-mother, and under\r\n\r\n      such conditions that it seems impossible for human reason to demonstrate\r\n\r\n      the contrary. Natacha Feodorovna herself, crushed by the tragic\r\n\r\n      occurrence, was not able to answer her accusers at all, and her silence\r\n\r\n      has been taken for a confession of guilt. Messieurs, Natacha Feodorovna\r\n\r\n      will be started for Siberia to-morrow. We can do nothing for her. Natacha\r\n\r\n      Feodorovna is lost to us.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, with a gesture to those who surrounded Rouletabille:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo your duty, messieurs.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon, pardon. But if I do prove the innocence of Natacha? Just wait,\r\n\r\n      messieurs. There is only I who can prove that innocence! You lose Natacha\r\n\r\n      by killing me!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you had been able to prove that innocence, monsieur, the thing would\r\n\r\n      already be done. You would not have waited.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon, pardon. It is only at this moment that I have become able to do\r\n\r\n      it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is because I was sick, you see\u2014very seriously sick. That affair\r\n\r\n      of Michael Nikolaievitch and the poison that still continued after he was\r\n\r\n      dead simply robbed me of all my powers. Now that I am sure I have not been\r\n\r\n      the means of killing an innocent man\u2014I am Rouletabille again! It is\r\n\r\n      not possible that I shall not find the way, that I shall not see through\r\n\r\n      this mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The terrible voice of the Christ-like figure said monotonously:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo your duty, messieurs.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon, pardon. This is of great importance to you\u2014and the proof is\r\n\r\n      that you have not yet hanged me. You were not so procrastinating with my\r\n\r\n      predecessor, were you? You have listened to me because you have hoped!\r\n\r\n      Very well, let me think, let me consider. Oh, the devil! I was there\r\n\r\n      myself at the fatal luncheon, and I know better than anyone else all that\r\n\r\n      happened there. Five minutes! I demand five minutes of you; it is not\r\n\r\n      much. Five little minutes!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      These last words of the condemned man seemed to singularly influence the\r\n\r\n      revolutionaries. They looked at one another in silence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then the president took out his watch and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFive minutes. We grant them to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPut your watch here. Here on this nail. It is five minutes to seven, eh?\r\n\r\n      You will give me until the hour?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, until the hour. The watch itself will strike when the hour has\r\n\r\n      come.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, it strikes! Like the general\u2019s watch, then. Very well, here we are.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then there was the curious spectacle of Rouletabille standing on the\r\n\r\n      hangman\u2019s stool, the fatal rope hanging above his head, his legs crossed,\r\n\r\n      his elbow on his knees in that eternal attitude which Art has always given\r\n\r\n      to human thought, his fists under his jaws, his eyes fixed\u2014all\r\n\r\n      around him, all those young men intent on his silence, not moving a\r\n\r\n      muscle, turned into statues themselves that they might not disturb the\r\n\r\n      statue which thought and thought.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XVIII. A SINGULAR EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The five minutes ticked away and the watch commenced to strike the hour\u2019s\r\n\r\n      seven strokes. Did it sound the death of Rouletabille? Perhaps not! For at\r\n\r\n      the first silver tinkle they saw Rouletabille shake himself, and raise his\r\n\r\n      head, with his face alight and his eyes shining. They saw him stand up,\r\n\r\n      spread out his arms and cry:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have found it!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Such joy shone in his countenance that there seemed to be an aureole\r\n\r\n      around him, and none of those there doubted that he had the solution of\r\n\r\n      the impossible problem.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have found it! I have found it!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      They gathered around him. He waved them away as in a waking dream.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGive me room. I have found it, if my experiment works out. One, two,\r\n\r\n      three, four, five...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      What was he doing? He counted his steps now, in long paces, as in dueling\r\n\r\n      preliminaries. And the others, all of them, followed him in silence,\r\n\r\n      puzzled, but without protest, as if they, too, were caught in the same\r\n\r\n      strange day-dream. Steadily counting his steps he crossed thus the court,\r\n\r\n      which was vast. \u201cForty, forty-one, forty-two,\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cThis\r\n\r\n      is certainly strange, and very promising.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The others, although they did not understand, refrained from questioning\r\n\r\n      him, for they saw there was nothing to do but let him go ahead without\r\n\r\n      interruption, just as care is taken not to wake a somnambulist abruptly.\r\n\r\n      They had no mistrust of his motives, for the idea was simply untenable\r\n\r\n      that Rouletabille was fool enough to hope to save himself from them by an\r\n\r\n      imbecile subterfuge. No, they yielded to the impression his inspired\r\n\r\n      countenance gave them, and several were so affected that they\r\n\r\n      unconsciously repeated his gestures. Thus Rouletabille reached the edge of\r\n\r\n      the court where judgment had been pronounced against him. There he had to\r\n\r\n      mount a rickety flight of stairs, whose steps he counted. He reached a\r\n\r\n      corridor, but moving away from the side where the door was opening to the\r\n\r\n      exterior he turned toward a staircase leading to the upper floor, and\r\n\r\n      still counted the steps as he climbed them. Some of the company followed\r\n\r\n      him, others hurried ahead of him. But he did not seem aware of either the\r\n\r\n      one or the other, as he walked along living only in his thoughts. He\r\n\r\n      reached the landing-place, hesitated, pushed open a door, and found\r\n\r\n      himself in a room furnished with a table, two chairs, a mattress and a\r\n\r\n      huge cupboard. He went to the cupboard, turned the key and opened it. The\r\n\r\n      cupboard was empty. He closed it again and put the key in his pocket. Then\r\n\r\n      he went out onto the landing-place again. There he asked for the key of\r\n\r\n      the chamber-door he had just left. They gave it to him and he locked that\r\n\r\n      door and put that key also in his pocket. Now he returned into the court.\r\n\r\n      He asked for a chair. It was brought him. Immediately he placed his head\r\n\r\n      in his hands, thinking hard, took the chair and carried it over a little\r\n\r\n      behind the shed. The Nihilists watched everything he did and they did not\r\n\r\n      smile, because men do not smile when death waits at the end of things,\r\n\r\n      however foolish.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Finally, Rouletabille spoke:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMessieurs,\u201d said he, his voice low and shaken, because he knew that now\r\n\r\n      he touched the decisive minute, after which there could only be an\r\n\r\n      irrevocable fate. \u201cMessieurs, in order to continue my experiment I am\r\n\r\n      obliged to go through movements that might suggest to you the idea of an\r\n\r\n      attempt at escape, or evasion. I hope you don\u2019t regard me as fool enough\r\n\r\n      to have any such thought.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, monsieur,\u201d said the chief, \u201cyou are free to go through all the\r\n\r\n      maneuvers you wish. No one escapes us. Outside we should have you within\r\n\r\n      arm\u2019s reach quite as well as here. And, besides, it is entirely impossible\r\n\r\n      to escape from here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well. Then that is understood. In such a case, I ask you now to\r\n\r\n      remain just where you are and not to budge, whatever I do, if you don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      wish to inconvenience me. Only please send someone now up to the next\r\n\r\n      floor, where I am going to go again, and let him watch what happens from\r\n\r\n      there, but without interfering. And don\u2019t speak a word to me during the\r\n\r\n      experiment.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Two of the revolutionaries went to the upper floor, and opened a window in\r\n\r\n      order to keep track of what went on in the court. All now showed their\r\n\r\n      intense interest in the acts and gestures of Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter placed himself in the shed, between his death-stool and his\r\n\r\n      hanging-rope.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cReady,\u201d said he; \u201cI am going to begin\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And suddenly he jumped like a wild man, crossed the court in a straight\r\n\r\n      line like a flash, disappeared in the touba, bounded up the staircase,\r\n\r\n      felt in his pocket and drew out the keys, opened the door of the chamber\r\n\r\n      he had locked, closed it and locked it again, turned right-about-face,\r\n\r\n      came down again in the same haste, reached the court, and this time\r\n\r\n      swerved to the chair, went round it, still running, and returned at the\r\n\r\n      same speed to the shed. He no sooner reached there than he uttered a cry\r\n\r\n      of triumph as he glanced at the watch banging from a post. \u201cI have won,\u201d\r\n\r\n       he said, and threw himself with a happy thrill upon the fatal scaffold.\r\n\r\n      They surrounded him, and he read the liveliest curiosity in all their\r\n\r\n      faces. Panting still from his mad rush, he asked for two words apart with\r\n\r\n      the chief of the Secret committee.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The man who had pronounced judgment and who had the bearing of Jesus\r\n\r\n      advanced, and there was a brief exchange of words between the two young\r\n\r\n      men. The others drew back and waited at a distance, in impressive silence,\r\n\r\n      the outcome of this mysterious colloquy, which certainly would settle\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s fate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMessieurs,\u201d said the chief, \u201cthe young Frenchman is going to be allowed\r\n\r\n      to leave. We give him twenty-four hours to set Natacha Feodorovna free. In\r\n\r\n      twenty-four hours, if he has not succeeded, he will return here to give\r\n\r\n      himself up.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A happy murmur greeted these words. The moment their chief spoke thus,\r\n\r\n      they felt sure of Natacha\u2019s fate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The chief added:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs the liberation of Natacha Feodorovna will be followed, the young\r\n\r\n      Frenchman says, by that of our companion Matiew, we decide that, if these\r\n\r\n      two conditions are fulfilled, M. Joseph Rouletabille is allowed to return\r\n\r\n      in entire security to France, which he ought never to have left.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Two or three only of the group said, \u201cThat lad is playing with us; it is\r\n\r\n      not possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the chief declared:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet the lad try. He accomplishes miracles.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      XIX. THE TSAR\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have escaped by remarkable luck,\u201d cried Rouletabille, as he found\r\n\r\n      himself, in the middle of the night, at the corner of the Katharine and\r\n\r\n      the Aptiekarski Pereoulok Canals, while the mysterious carriage which had\r\n\r\n      brought him there returned rapidly toward the Grande Ecurie. \u201cWhat a\r\n\r\n      country! What a country!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He ran a little way to the Grand Morskaia, which was near, entered the\r\n\r\n      hotel like a bomb, dragged the interpreter from his bed, demanded that his\r\n\r\n      bill be made out and that he be told the time of the next train for\r\n\r\n      Tsarskoie-Coelo. The interpreter told him that he could not have his bill\r\n\r\n      at such an hour, that he could not leave town without his passport and\r\n\r\n      that there was no train for Tsarskoie-Coelo, and Rouletabille made an\r\n\r\n      outcry that woke the whole hotel. The guests, fearing always \u201cune\r\n\r\n      scandale,\u201d kept close to their rooms. But Monsieur le directeur came down,\r\n\r\n      trembling. When he found all that it was about he was inclined to be\r\n\r\n      peremptory, but Rouletabille, who had seen \u201cMichael Strogoff\u201d played,\r\n\r\n      cried, \u201cService of the Tsar!\u201d which turned him submissive as a sheep. He\r\n\r\n      made out the young man\u2019s bill and gave him his passport, which had been\r\n\r\n      brought back by the police during the afternoon. Rouletabille rapidly\r\n\r\n      wrote a message to Koupriane\u2019s address, which the messenger was directed\r\n\r\n      to have delivered without a moment\u2019s delay, under the pain of death! The\r\n\r\n      manager humbly promised and the reporter did not explain that by \u201cpain of\r\n\r\n      death\u201d he referred to his own. Then, having ascertained that as a matter\r\n\r\n      of fact the last train had left for Tsarskoie-Coelo, he ordered a carriage\r\n\r\n      and hurried to his room to pack.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he, ordinarily so detailed, so particular in his affairs, threw things\r\n\r\n      every which way, linen, garments, with kicks and shoves. It was a relief\r\n\r\n      after the emotions he had gone through. \u201cWhat a country!\u201d he never ceased\r\n\r\n      to ejaculate. \u201cWhat a country!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then the carriage was ready, with two little Finnish horses, whose gait he\r\n\r\n      knew well, an evil-looking driver, who none the less would get him there;\r\n\r\n      the trunk; roubles to the domestics. \u201cSpacibo, barine. Spacibo.\u201d (Thank\r\n\r\n      you, monsieur. Thank you.)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The interpreter asked what address he should give the driver.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe home of the Tsar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The interpreter hesitated, believing it to be an unbecoming pleasantry,\r\n\r\n      then waved vaguely to the driver, and the horses started.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a curious trot! We have no idea of that in France,\u201d thought\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille. \u201cFrance! France! Paris! Is it possible that soon I shall be\r\n\r\n      back! And that dear Lady in Black! Ah, at the first opportunity I must\r\n\r\n      send her a dispatch of my return\u2014before she receives those ikons,\r\n\r\n      and the letters announcing my death. Scan! Scan! Scan! (Hurry!)\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The isvotchick pounded his horses, crowding past the dvornicks who watched\r\n\r\n      at the corners of the houses during the St. Petersburg night. \u201cDirigi!\r\n\r\n      dirigi! dirigi! (Look out!)\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The country, somber in the somber night. The vast open country. What\r\n\r\n      monotonous desolation! Rapidly, through the vast silent spaces, the little\r\n\r\n      car glided over the lonely route into the black arms of the pines.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, holding on to his seat, looked about him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGod! this is as sad as a funeral display.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Little frozen huts, no larger than tombs, occasionally indicated the road,\r\n\r\n      but there was no mark of life in that country except the noise of the\r\n\r\n      journey and the two beasts with steaming coats.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Crack! One of the shafts broken. \u201cWhat a country!\u201d To hear Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      one would suppose that only in Russia could the shaft of a carriage break.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The repair was difficult and crude, with bits of rope. And from then on\r\n\r\n      the journey was slow and cautious after the frenzied speed. In vain\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille reasoned with himself. \u201cYou will arrive anyway before\r\n\r\n      morning. You cannot wake the Emperor in the dead of night.\u201d His impatience\r\n\r\n      knew no reason. \u201cWhat a country! What a country!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      After some other petty adventures (they ran into a ravine and had\r\n\r\n      tremendous difficulty rescuing the trunk) they arrived at Tsarskoie-Coelo\r\n\r\n      at a quarter of seven.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Even here the country was not pleasant. Rouletabille recalled the bright\r\n\r\n      awakening of French country. Here it seemed there was something more dead\r\n\r\n      than death: it was this little city with its streets where no one passed,\r\n\r\n      not a soul, not a phantom, with its houses so impenetrable, the windows\r\n\r\n      even of glazed glass and further blinded by the morning hoar-frost\r\n\r\n      shutting out light more thoroughly than closed eyelids. Behind them he\r\n\r\n      pictured to himself a world unknown, a world which neither spoke nor wept,\r\n\r\n      nor laughed, a world in which no living chord resounded. \u201cWhat a country!\r\n\r\n      \u2018Where is the chateau? I do not know; I have been here only once, in the\r\n\r\n      marshal\u2019s carriage. I do not know the way. Not the great palace! The idiot\r\n\r\n      of a driver has brought me to this great palace in order to see it, I\r\n\r\n      haven\u2019t a doubt. Does Rouletabille look like a tourist? Dourak! The home\r\n\r\n      of the Tsar, I tell you. The Tsar\u2019s residence. The place where the Little\r\n\r\n      Father lives. Chez Batouchka!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The driver lashed his ponies. He drove past all the streets. \u201cStoi!\r\n\r\n      (Stop!)\u201d cried Rouletabille. A gate, a soldier, musket at shoulder,\r\n\r\n      bayonet in play; another gate, another soldier, another bayonet; a park\r\n\r\n      with walls around it, and around the walls more soldiers.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo mistake; here is the place,\u201d thought Rouletabille. There was only one\r\n\r\n      prisoner for whom such pains would be taken. He advanced towards the gate.\r\n\r\n      Ah! They crossed bayonets under his nose. Halt! No fooling, Joseph\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, of \u201cL\u2019Epoque.\u201d A subaltern came from a guard-house and\r\n\r\n      advanced toward him. Explanation evidently was going to be difficult. The\r\n\r\n      young man saw that if he demanded to see the Tsar, they would think him\r\n\r\n      crazed and that would further complicate matters. He asked for the\r\n\r\n      Grand-Marshal of the Court. They replied that he could get the Marshal\u2019s\r\n\r\n      address in Tsarskoie. But the subaltern turned his head. He saw someone\r\n\r\n      advancing. It was the Grand-Marshal himself. Some exceptional service\r\n\r\n      called him, without doubt, very early to the Court.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, what are you doing here? You are not yet gone then, Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPoliteness before everything, Monsieur le Grand-Marechal! I would not go\r\n\r\n      before saying \u2018Au revoir\u2019 to the Emperor. Be so good, since you are going\r\n\r\n      to him and he has risen (you yourself have told me he rises at seven), be\r\n\r\n      so good as to say to him that I wish to pay my respects before leaving.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour scheme, doubtless, is to speak to him once more regarding Natacha\r\n\r\n      Feodorovna?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot at all. Tell him, Excellency, that I am come to explain the mystery\r\n\r\n      of the eider downs.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, ah, the eider downs! You know something?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Grand Marshal saw that the young man did not pretend. He asked him to\r\n\r\n      wait a few minutes, and vanished into the park.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      A quarter of an hour later, Joseph Rouletabille, of the journal\r\n\r\n      \u201cL\u2019Epoque,\u201d was admitted into the cabinet that he knew well from the first\r\n\r\n      interview he had had there with His Majesty. The simple work-room of a\r\n\r\n      country-house: a few pictures on the walls, portraits of the Tsarina and\r\n\r\n      the imperial children on the table; Oriental cigarettes in the tiny gold\r\n\r\n      cups. Rouletabille was far from feeling any assurance, for the\r\n\r\n      Grand-Marshal had said to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe cautious. The Emperor is in a terrible humor about you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A door opened and closed. The Tsar made a sign to the Marshal, who\r\n\r\n      disappeared. Rouletabille bowed low, then watched the Emperor closely.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Quite apparently His Majesty was displeased. The face of the Tsar,\r\n\r\n      ordinarily so calm, so pleasant, and smiling, was severe, and his eyes had\r\n\r\n      an angry light. He seated himself and lighted a cigarette.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d he commenced, \u201cI am not otherwise sorry to see you before your\r\n\r\n      departure in order to say to you myself that I am not at all pleased with\r\n\r\n      you. If you were one of my subjects I would have already started you on\r\n\r\n      the road to the Ural Mountains.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI remove myself farther, Sire.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I pray you not to interrupt me and not to speak unless I ask\r\n\r\n      you a question.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, pardon, Sire, pardon.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am not duped by the pretext you have offered Monsieur le Grand-Marechal\r\n\r\n      in order to penetrate here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is not a pretext, Sire.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAgain!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, pardon, Sire, pardon.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI say to you that, called here to aid me against my enemies, they\r\n\r\n      themselves have not found a stronger or more criminal support than in\r\n\r\n      you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf what am I accused, Sire?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cKoupriane\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! Ah! ... Pardon!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy Chief of Police justly complains that you have traversed all his\r\n\r\n      designs and that you have taken it upon yourself to ruin them. First, you\r\n\r\n      removed his agents, who inconvenienced you, it seems; then, the moment\r\n\r\n      that he had the proof in hand of the abominable alliance of Natacha\r\n\r\n      Feodorovna with the Nihilists who attempt the assassination of her father\r\n\r\n      your intervention has permitted that proof to escape him. And you have\r\n\r\n      boasted of the feat, monsieur, so that we can only consider you\r\n\r\n      responsible for the attempts that followed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWithout you, Natacha would not have attempted to poison her father.\r\n\r\n      Without you, they would not have sent to find physicians who could blow up\r\n\r\n      the datcha des Iles. Finally, no later than yesterday, when this faithful\r\n\r\n      servant of mine had set a trap they could not have escaped from, you have\r\n\r\n      had the audacity, you, to warn them of it. They owe their escape to you.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur, those are attempts against the security of the State which\r\n\r\n      deserves the heaviest punishment. Why, you went out one day from here\r\n\r\n      promising me to save General Trebassof from all the plotting assassins who\r\n\r\n      lurked about him. And then you play the game of the assassins! Your\r\n\r\n      conduct is as miserable as that of Natacha Feodorovna is monstrous!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Emperor ceased, and looked at Rouletabille, who had not lowered his\r\n\r\n      eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat can you say for yourself? Speak\u2014now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can only say to Your Majesty that I come to take leave of you because\r\n\r\n      my task here is finished. I have promised you the life of General\r\n\r\n      Trebassof, and I bring it to you. He runs no danger any more! I say\r\n\r\n      further to Your Majesty that there exists nowhere in the world a daughter\r\n\r\n      more devoted to her father, even to the death, a daughter more sublime\r\n\r\n      than Natacha Feodorovna, nor more innocent.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe careful, monsieur. I inform you that I have studied this affair\r\n\r\n      personally and very closely. You have the proofs of these statements you\r\n\r\n      advance?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Sire.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd I, I have the proofs that Natacha Feodorovna is a renegade.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At this contradiction, uttered in a firm voice, the Emperor stirred, a\r\n\r\n      flush of anger and of outraged majesty in his face. But, after this first\r\n\r\n      movement, he succeeded in controlling himself, opened a drawer brusquely,\r\n\r\n      took out some papers and threw them on the table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere they are.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille reached for the papers.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou do not read Russian, monsieur. I will translate their purport for\r\n\r\n      you. Know, then, that there has been a mysterious exchange of letters\r\n\r\n      between Natacha Feodorovna and the Central Revolutionary Committee, and\r\n\r\n      that these letters show the daughter of General Trebassof to be in perfect\r\n\r\n      accord with the assassins of her father for the execution of their\r\n\r\n      abominable project.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe death of the general?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\t \t \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI declare to Your Majesty that that is not possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cObstinate man! I will read\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cUseless, Sire. It is impossible. There may be in them the question of a\r\n\r\n      project, but I am greatly surprised if these conspirators have been\r\n\r\n      sufficiently imprudent to write in those letters that they count on\r\n\r\n      Natacha to poison her father.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, as a matter of fact, is not written, and you yourself are\r\n\r\n      responsible for it not being there. It does not follow any the less that\r\n\r\n      Natacha Feodorovna had an understanding with the Nihilists.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is correct, Sire.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, you confess that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not confess; I simply affirm that Natacha had an understanding with\r\n\r\n      the Nihilists.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho plotted their abominable attacks against the ex-Governor of Moscow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSire, since Natacha had an understanding with the Nihilists, it was not\r\n\r\n      to kill her father, but to save him. And the project of which you hold\r\n\r\n      here the proofs, but of whose character you are unaware, is to end the\r\n\r\n      attacks of which you speak, instantly.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou say that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI speak the truth, Sire.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere are the proofs? Show me your papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have none. I have only my word.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is not sufficient.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt will be sufficient, once you have heard me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI listen.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSire, before revealing to you a secret on which depends the life of\r\n\r\n      General Trebassof, you must permit me some questions. Your Majesty holds\r\n\r\n      the life of the general very dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat has that to do with it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPardon. I desire that Your Majesty assure me on that point.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe general has protected my throne. He has saved the Empire from one of\r\n\r\n      the greatest dangers that it has ever run. If the servant who has done\r\n\r\n      such a service should be rewarded by death, by the punishment that the\r\n\r\n      enemies of my people prepare for him in the darkness, I should never\r\n\r\n      forgive myself. There have been too many martyrs already!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have replied to me, Sire, in such a way that you make me understand\r\n\r\n      there is no sacrifice\u2014even to the sacrifice of your amour-propre the\r\n\r\n      greatest a ruler can suffer\u2014no sacrifice too dear to ransom from\r\n\r\n      death one of these martyrs.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, ah! These gentlemen lay down conditions to me! Money. Money. They\r\n\r\n      need money. And at how much do they rate the head of the general?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSire, that does not touch Your Majesty, and I never will come to offer\r\n\r\n      you such a bargain. That matter concerns only Natacha Feodorovna, who has\r\n\r\n      offered her fortune!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHer fortune! But she has nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe will have one at the death of the general. Now she engages to give it\r\n\r\n      all to the Revolutionary Committee the day the general dies\u2014if he\r\n\r\n      dies a natural death!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Emperor rose, greatly agitated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo the Revolutionary Party! What do you tell me! The fortune of the\r\n\r\n      general! Eh, but these are great riches.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSire, I have told you the secret. You alone should know it and guard it\r\n\r\n      forever, and I have your sacred word that, when the hour comes, you will\r\n\r\n      let the prize go where it is promised. If the general ever learns of such\r\n\r\n      a thing, such a treaty, he would easily arrange that nothing should\r\n\r\n      remain, and he would denounce his daughter who has saved him, and then he\r\n\r\n      would promptly be the prey of his enemies and yours, from whom you wish to\r\n\r\n      save him. I have told the secret not to the Emperor, but to the\r\n\r\n      representative of God on the Russian earth. I have confessed it to the\r\n\r\n      priest, who is bound to forget the words uttered only before God. Allow\r\n\r\n      Natacha Feodorovna her own way, Sire! And her father, your servant, whose\r\n\r\n      life is so dear to you, is saved. At the natural death of the general his\r\n\r\n      fortune will go to his daughter, who has disposed of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille stopped a moment to judge of the effect produced. It was not\r\n\r\n      good. The face of his august listener was more and more in a frown.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The silence continued, and now the reporter did not dare to break it. He\r\n\r\n      waited.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Finally, the Emperor rose and walked forward and backward across the room,\r\n\r\n      deep in thought. For a moment he stopped at the window and waved\r\n\r\n      paternally to the little Tsarevitch, who played in the park with the\r\n\r\n      grand-duchesses.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then he returned to Rouletabille and pinched his ear.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, tell me, how have you learned all this? And who then has poisoned\r\n\r\n      the general and his wife, in the kiosk, if not Natacha?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNatacha is a saint. It is nothing, Sire, that she has been raised in\r\n\r\n      luxury, and vows herself to misery; but it is sublime that she guards in\r\n\r\n      her heart the secret of her sacrifice from everyone, and, in spite of all,\r\n\r\n      because secrecy is necessary and has been required of her. See her\r\n\r\n      guarding it before her father, who has been brought to believe in the\r\n\r\n      dishonor of his daughter, and still to be silent when a word would have\r\n\r\n      proved her innocent; guarding it face to face with her fiance, whom she\r\n\r\n      loves, and repulses because marriage is forbidden to the girl who is\r\n\r\n      supposed to be rich and who will be poor; guarding it, above all\u2014and\r\n\r\n      guarding it still\u2014in the depths of the dungeon, and ready to take\r\n\r\n      the road to Siberia under the accusation of assassination, because that\r\n\r\n      ignominy is necessary for the safety of her father. That, Sire\u2014oh,\r\n\r\n      Sire, do you see!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut you, how have you been able to penetrate into this guarded secret?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy watching her eyes. By observing, when she believed herself alone, the\r\n\r\n      look of terror and the gleams of love. And, beyond all, by looking at her\r\n\r\n      when she was looking at her father. Ah, Sire, there were moments when on\r\n\r\n      her mystic face one could read the wild joy and devotion of the martyr.\r\n\r\n      Then, by listening and by piecing together scraps of phrases inconsistent\r\n\r\n      with the idea of treachery, but which immediately acquired meaning if one\r\n\r\n      thought of the opposite, of sacrifice. Ah, that is it, Sire! Consider\r\n\r\n      always the alternative motive. What I finally could see myself, the\r\n\r\n      others, who had a fixed opinion about Natacha, could not see. And why had\r\n\r\n      they their fixed opinion? Simply because the idea of compromise with the\r\n\r\n      Nihilists aroused at once the idea of complicity! For such people it is\r\n\r\n      always the same thing\u2014they never can see but the one side of the\r\n\r\n      situation. But, nevertheless, the situation had two sides, as all\r\n\r\n      situations have. The question was simple. The compromise was certain. But\r\n\r\n      why had Natacha compromised herself with the Nihilists? Was it necessarily\r\n\r\n      in order to lose her father? Might it not be, on the contrary, in order to\r\n\r\n      save him? When one has rendezvous with an enemy it is not necessarily to\r\n\r\n      enter into his game, sometimes it is to disarm him with an offer. Between\r\n\r\n      these two hypotheses, which I alone took the trouble to examine, I did not\r\n\r\n      hesitate long, because Natacha\u2019s every attitude proclaimed her innocence:\r\n\r\n      and her eyes, Sire, in which one read purity and love, prevailed always\r\n\r\n      with me against all the passing appearances of disgrace and crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI saw that Natacha negotiated with them. But what had she to place in the\r\n\r\n      scales against the life of her father? Nothing\u2014except the fortune\r\n\r\n      that she would have one day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSome words she spoke about the impossibility of immediate marriage, about\r\n\r\n      poverty which could always knock at the door of any mansion, remarks that\r\n\r\n      I was able to overhear between Natacha and Boris Mourazoff, which to him\r\n\r\n      meant nothing, put me definitely on the right road. And I was not long in\r\n\r\n      ascertaining that the negotiations in this formidable affair were taking\r\n\r\n      place in the very house of Trebassof! Pursued without by the incessant\r\n\r\n      spying of Koupriane, who sought to surprise her in company with the\r\n\r\n      Nihilists, watched closely, too, by the jealous supervision of Boris, who\r\n\r\n      was jealous of Michael Nikolaievitch, she had to seize the only\r\n\r\n      opportunities possible for such negotiations, at night, in her own home,\r\n\r\n      the sole place where, by the very audacity of it, she was able to play her\r\n\r\n      part in any security.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMichael Nikolaievitch knew Annouchka. There was certainly the point of\r\n\r\n      departure for the negotiations which that felon-officer, traitor to all\r\n\r\n      sides, worked at will toward the realization of his own infamous project.\r\n\r\n      I do not think that Michael ever confided to Natacha that he was, from the\r\n\r\n      very first, the instrument of the revolutionaries. Natacha, who sought to\r\n\r\n      get in touch with the revolutionary party, had to entrust him with a\r\n\r\n      correspondence for Annouchka, following which he assumed direction of the\r\n\r\n      affair, deceiving the Nihilists, who, in their absolute penury, following\r\n\r\n      the revolt, had been seduced by the proposition of General Trebassof\u2019s\r\n\r\n      daughter, and deceiving Natacha, whom he pretended to love and by whom he\r\n\r\n      believed himself loved. At this point in the affair Natacha came to\r\n\r\n      understand that it was necessary to propitiate Michael Nikolaievitch, her\r\n\r\n      indispensable intermediary, and she managed to do it so well that Boris\r\n\r\n      Mourazoff felt the blackest jealousy. On his side, Michael came to believe\r\n\r\n      that Natacha would have no other husband than himself, but he did not\r\n\r\n      propose to marry a penniless girl! And, fatally, it followed that Natacha,\r\n\r\n      in that infernal intrigue, negotiated for the life of her father through\r\n\r\n      the agency of a man who, underhandedly, sought to strike at the general\r\n\r\n      himself, because the immediate death of her father before the negotiation\r\n\r\n      was completed would enrich Natacha, who had given Michael so much to hope.\r\n\r\n      That frightful tragedy, Sire, in which we have lived our most painful\r\n\r\n      hours, appeared to me, confident of Natacha\u2019s innocence, as absolutely\r\n\r\n      simple as for the others it seemed complicated. Natacha believed she had\r\n\r\n      in Michael Nikolaievitch a man who worked for her, but he worked only for\r\n\r\n      himself. The day that I was convinced of it, Sire, by my examination of\r\n\r\n      the approach to the balcony, I had a mind to warn Natacha, to go to her\r\n\r\n      and say, \u2018Get rid of that man. He will betray you. If you need an agent, I\r\n\r\n      am at your service.\u2019 But that day, at Krestowsky, destiny prevented my\r\n\r\n      rejoining Natacha; and I must attribute it to destiny, which would not\r\n\r\n      permit the loss of that man. Michael Nikolaievitch, who was a traitor, was\r\n\r\n      too much in the \u2018combination,\u2019 and if he had been rejected he would have\r\n\r\n      ruined everything. I caused him to disappear! The great misfortune then\r\n\r\n      was that Natacha, holding me responsible for the death of a man she\r\n\r\n      believed innocent, never wished to see me again, and, when she did see me,\r\n\r\n      refused to have any conversation with me because I proposed that I take\r\n\r\n      Michael\u2019s place for her with the revolutionaries. She would have nothing\r\n\r\n      to do with me in order to protect her secret. Meantime, the Nihilists\r\n\r\n      believed they were betrayed by Natacha when they learned of the death of\r\n\r\n      Michael, and they undertook to avenge him. They seized Natacha, and bore\r\n\r\n      her off by force. The unhappy girl learned then, that same evening, of the\r\n\r\n      attack which destroyed the datcha and, happily, still spared her father.\r\n\r\n      This time she reached a definite understanding with the revolutionary\r\n\r\n      party. Her bargain was made. I offer you for proof of it only her attitude\r\n\r\n      when she was arrested, and, even in that moment, her sublime silence.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      While Rouletabille urged his view, the Emperor let him talk on and on, and\r\n\r\n      now his eyes were dim.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it possible that Natacha has not been the accomplice, in all, of\r\n\r\n      Michael Nikolaievitch?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIt was she who opened her father\u2019s\r\n\r\n      house to him that night. If she was not his accomplice she would have\r\n\r\n      mistrusted him, she would have watched him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSire, Michael Nikolaievitch was a very clever man. He knew so well how to\r\n\r\n      play upon Natacha, and Annouchka, in whom she placed all her hope. It was\r\n\r\n      from Annouchka that she wished to hold the life of her father. It was the\r\n\r\n      word, the signature of Annouchka that she demanded before giving her own.\r\n\r\n      The evening Michael Nikolaievitch died, he was charged to bring her that\r\n\r\n      signature. I know it, myself, because, pretending drunkenness, I was able\r\n\r\n      to overhear enough of a conversation between Annouchka and a man whose\r\n\r\n      name I must conceal. Yes, that last evening, Michael Nikolaievitch, when\r\n\r\n      he entered the datcha, had the signature in his pocket, but also he\r\n\r\n      carried the weapon or the poison with which he already had attempted and\r\n\r\n      was resolved to reach the father of her whom he believed was assuredly to\r\n\r\n      be his wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou speak now of a paper, very precious, that I regret not to possess,\r\n\r\n      monsieur,\u201d said the Tsar coldly, \u201cbecause that paper alone would have\r\n\r\n      proved to me the innocence of your protegee.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you have not it, Sire, you know well that it is because I have wished\r\n\r\n      you to have it. The corpse had been searched by Katharina, the little\r\n\r\n      Bohemian, and I, Sire, prevented Koupriane from finding that signature in\r\n\r\n      Katharina\u2019s possession. In saving the secret I have saved General\r\n\r\n      Trebassof\u2019s life, who would have preferred to die rather than accept such\r\n\r\n      an arrangement.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Tsar stopped Rouletabille in his enthusiastic outburst.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll that would be very beautiful and perhaps admirable,\u201d said he, more\r\n\r\n      and more coldly, because he had entirely recovered himself, \u201cif Natacha\r\n\r\n      had not, herself, with her own hand, poisoned her father and her\r\n\r\n      step-mother!\u2014always with arsenate of soda.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, some of that had been left in the house,\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cThey\r\n\r\n      had not given me all of it for the analysis after the first attempt. But\r\n\r\n      Natacha is innocent of that, Sire. I swear it to you. As true as that I\r\n\r\n      have certainly escaped being hanged.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow, hanged?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, it has not amounted to much now, Your Majesty.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Rouletabille recounted his sinister adventure, up to the moment of his\r\n\r\n      death, or, rather, up to the moment when he had believed he was going to\r\n\r\n      die.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Emperor listened to the young reporter with complete stupefaction. He\r\n\r\n      murmured, \u201cPoor lad!\u201d then, suddenly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut how have you managed to escape them?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSire they have given me twenty-four hours for you to set Natacha at\r\n\r\n      liberty, that is to say, that you restore her to her rights, all her\r\n\r\n      rights, and she be always the recognized heiress of Trebassof. Do you\r\n\r\n      understand me, Sire?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will understand you, perhaps, when you have explained to me how Natacha\r\n\r\n      has not poisoned her father and step-mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are some things so simple, Sire, that one is able to think of them\r\n\r\n      only with a rope around one\u2019s neck. But let us reason it out. We have here\r\n\r\n      four persons, two of whom have been poisoned and the other two with them\r\n\r\n      have not been. Now, it is certain that, of the four persons, the general\r\n\r\n      has not wished to poison himself, that his wife has not wished to poison\r\n\r\n      the general, and that, as for me, I have not wished to poison anybody.\r\n\r\n      That, if we are absolutely sure of it, leaves as the poisoner only\r\n\r\n      Natacha. That is so certain, so inevitable, that there is only one case,\r\n\r\n      one alone, where, in such conditions, Natacha would not be regarded as the\r\n\r\n      poisoner.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI confess that, logically, I do not see,\u201d said the Tsar, \u201canything beyond\r\n\r\n      that but more and more of a tangle. What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLogically, the only case would be that where no one had been poisoned,\r\n\r\n      that is to say, where no one had taken any poison.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the presence of the poison has been established!\u201d cried the Emperor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill, the presence of the poison proves only its presence, not the\r\n\r\n      crime. Both poison and ipecac were found in the stomach expulsions. From\r\n\r\n      which a crime has been concluded. What state of affairs was necessary for\r\n\r\n      there to have been no crime? Simply that the poison should have appeared\r\n\r\n      in the expulsions after the ipecac. Then there would have been no\r\n\r\n      poisoning, but everyone would believe there had been. And, for that,\r\n\r\n      someone would have poured the poison into the expulsions.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Tsar never quitted Rouletabille\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is extraordinary,\u201d said he. \u201cBut of course it is possible. In any\r\n\r\n      case, it is still only an hypothesis.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd so long as it could be an hypothesis that no one thought of, it could\r\n\r\n      be just that, Sire. But if I am here, it is because I have the proof that\r\n\r\n      that hypothesis corresponds to the reality. That necessary proof of\r\n\r\n      Natacha\u2019s innocence, Your Majesty, I have found with the rope around my\r\n\r\n      neck. Ah, I tell you it was time! What has hindered us hitherto, I do not\r\n\r\n      say to realize, but even to think, of that hypothesis? Simply that we\r\n\r\n      thought the illness of the general had commenced before the absorption of\r\n\r\n      the ipecac, since Matrena Petrovna had been obliged to go for it to her\r\n\r\n      medicine-closet after his illness commenced, in order to counteract the\r\n\r\n      poison of which she also appeared to be the victim.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, if I acquire proof that Matrena Petrovna had the ipecac at hand\r\n\r\n      before the sickness, my hypothesis of pretense at poisoning has\r\n\r\n      irresistible force. Because, if it was not to use it before, why did she\r\n\r\n      have it with her before? And if it was not that she wished to hide the\r\n\r\n      fact that she had used it before, why did she wish to make believe that\r\n\r\n      she went to find it afterwards?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, in order to show Natacha\u2019s innocence, here is what must be proved:\r\n\r\n      that Matrena Petrovna had the ipecac on her, even when she went to look\r\n\r\n      for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYoung Rouletabille, I hardly breathe,\u201d said the Tsar.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBreathe, Sire. The proof is here. Matrena Petrovna necessarily had the\r\n\r\n      ipecac on her, because after the sickness she had not the time for going\r\n\r\n      to find it. Do you understand, Sire? Between the moment when she fled from\r\n\r\n      the kiosk and when she returned there, she had not the actual time to go\r\n\r\n      to her medicine-closet to find the ipecac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow have you been able to compute the time?\u201d asked the Emperor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSire, the Lord God directed, Who made me admire Feodor Feodorovitch\u2019s\r\n\r\n      watch just when we went to read, and to read on the dial of that watch two\r\n\r\n      minutes to the hour, and the Lord God directed yet, Who, after the scene\r\n\r\n      of the poison, at the time Matrena returned carrying the ipecac publicly,\r\n\r\n      made the hour strike from that watch in the general\u2019s pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwo minutes. It was impossible for Matrena to have covered that distance\r\n\r\n      in two minutes. She could only have entered the deserted datcha and left\r\n\r\n      it again instantly. She had not taken the trouble to mount to the floor\r\n\r\n      above, where, she told us and repeated when she returned, the ipecac was\r\n\r\n      in the medicine-closet. She lied! And if she lied, all is explained.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was the striking of a watch, Sire, with a striking apparatus and a\r\n\r\n      sound like the general\u2019s, there in the quarters of the revolutionaries,\r\n\r\n      that roused my memory and indicated to me in a second this argument of the\r\n\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI got down from my gallows-scaffold, Your Majesty, to experiment on that\r\n\r\n      time-limit. Oh, nothing and nobody could have prevented my making that\r\n\r\n      experiment before I died, to prove to myself that Rouletabille had all\r\n\r\n      along been right. I had studied the grounds around the datcha enough to be\r\n\r\n      perfectly exact about the distances. I found in the court where I was to\r\n\r\n      be hanged the same number of steps that there were from the kiosk to the\r\n\r\n      steps of the veranda, and, as the staircase of the revolutionaries had\r\n\r\n      fewer steps, I lengthened my journey a few steps by walking around a\r\n\r\n      chair. Finally, I attended to the opening and closing of the doors that\r\n\r\n      Matrena would have had to do. I had looked at a watch when I started. When\r\n\r\n      I returned, Sire, and looked at the watch again, I had taken three minutes\r\n\r\n      to cover the distance\u2014and it is not for me to boast, but I am a\r\n\r\n      little livelier than the excellent Matrena.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMatrena had lied. Matrena had simulated the poisoning of the general.\r\n\r\n      Matrena had coolly poured ipecac in the general\u2019s glass while we were\r\n\r\n      illustrating with matches a curious-enough theory of the nature of the\r\n\r\n      constitution of the empire.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut this is abominable!\u201d cried the Emperor, this time definitely\r\n\r\n      convinced by the intricate argument of Rouletabille. \u201cAnd what end could\r\n\r\n      this imitation serve?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe end of preventing the real crime! The end that she believed herself\r\n\r\n      to have attained, Sire, to have Natacha removed forever\u2014Natacha whom\r\n\r\n      she believed capable of any crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, it is monstrous! Feodor Feodorovitch has often told me that Matrena\r\n\r\n      loved Natacha sincerely.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe loved her sincerely up to the day that she believed her guilty.\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna was sure of Natacha\u2019s complicity in Michael\r\n\r\n      Nikolaievitch\u2019s attempt to poison the general. I shared her stupor, her\r\n\r\n      despair, when Feodor Feodorovitch took his daughter in his arms after that\r\n\r\n      tragic night, and embraced her. He seemed to absolve her. It was then that\r\n\r\n      Matrena resolved within herself to save the general in spite of himself,\r\n\r\n      but I remain persuaded that, if she had dared such a plan against Natacha,\r\n\r\n      it would only be because of what she believed definite proof of her\r\n\r\n      step-daughter\u2019s infamy. These papers, Sire, that you have shown me, and\r\n\r\n      which show, if nothing more, an understanding between Natacha and the\r\n\r\n      revolutionaries, could only have been in the possession of Michael or of\r\n\r\n      Natacha. Nothing was found in Michael\u2019s quarters. Tell me, then, that\r\n\r\n      Matrena found them in Natacha\u2019s apartment. Then, she did not hesitate!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf one outlined her crime to her, do you believe she would confess it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      asked the Emperor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am so sure of it that I have had her brought here. By now Koupriane\r\n\r\n      should be here at the chateau, with Matrena Petrovna.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou think of everything, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Tsar moved to ring a bell. Rouletabille raised his hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot yet, Sire. I ask that you permit me not to be present at the\r\n\r\n      confusion of that brave, heroic, good woman who has loved me much. But\r\n\r\n      before I go, Sire\u2014do you promise me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Emperor believed he had not heard correctly or did not grasp the\r\n\r\n      meaning. He repeated what Rouletabille had said. The young reporter\r\n\r\n      repeated it once more:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you promise? No, Sire, I am not mad. I dare to ask you that. I have\r\n\r\n      confided my honor to Your Majesty. I have told you Natacha\u2019s secret. Well,\r\n\r\n      now, before Matrena\u2019s confession, I dare to ask you: Promise me to forget\r\n\r\n      that secret. It will not suffice merely to give Natacha back again to her\r\n\r\n      father. It is necessary to leave her course open to her\u2014if you\r\n\r\n      really wish to save General Trebassof. What do you decide, Sire?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is the first time anyone has questioned me, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, well, it will be the last. But I humbly beg Your Majesty to reply.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat would be many millions given to the Revolution.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, Sire, they are not given yet. The general is sixty-five, but he has\r\n\r\n      many years ahead of him, if you wish it. By the time he dies\u2014a\r\n\r\n      natural death, if you wish it\u2014your enemies will have disarmed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy enemies!\u201d murmured the Tsar in a low voice. \u201cNo, no; my enemies never\r\n\r\n      will disarm. Who, then, will be able to disarm them?\u201d added he,\r\n\r\n      melancholily, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cProgress, Sire! If you wish it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Tsar turned red and looked at the audacious young man, who met the\r\n\r\n      gaze of His Majesty frankly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is kind of you to say that, my young friend. But you speak as a\r\n\r\n      child.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs a child of France to the Father of the Russian people.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was said in a voice so solemn and, at the same time, so naively\r\n\r\n      touching, that the Tsar started. He gazed again for some time in silence\r\n\r\n      at this boy who, this time, turned away his brimming eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cProgress and pity, Sire.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d said the Emperor, \u201cit is promised.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was not able to restrain a joyous movement hardly in keeping.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou can ring now, Sire.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And the Tsar rang.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter passed into a little salon, where he found the Marshal,\r\n\r\n      Koupriane and Matrena Petrovna, who was \u201cin a state.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She threw a suspicious glance at Rouletabille, who was not treated this\r\n\r\n      morning as the dear little domovoi-doukh. She permitted herself to be\r\n\r\n      conducted, already trembling, before the Emperor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Koupriane agitatedly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt so happened, my dear Monsieur Koupriane, that I have the pardon of the\r\n\r\n      Emperor for all the crimes you have charged against me, and that I wish to\r\n\r\n      shake hands before I go, without any rancor. Monsieur Koupriane, the\r\n\r\n      Emperor will tell you himself that General Trebassof is saved, and that\r\n\r\n      his life will never be in danger any more. Do you know what follows? It\r\n\r\n      follows that you must at once set Matiew free, whom I have taken, if you\r\n\r\n      remember, under my protection. Tell him that he is going to make his way\r\n\r\n      in France. I will find him a place on condition that he forgets certain\r\n\r\n      lashes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSuch a promise! Such an attitude toward me!\u201d cried Koupriane. \u201cBut I will\r\n\r\n      wait for the Emperor to tell me all these fine things. And your Natacha,\r\n\r\n      what do you do with her?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe release her also, monsieur. Natacha never has been the monster that\r\n\r\n      you think.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow can you say that? Someone at least is guilty.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are two guilty. The first, Monsieur le Marechal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Marshal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur le Marechal, who had the imprudence to bring such dangerous\r\n\r\n      grapes to the datcha des Iles, and\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the other?\u201d asked Koupriane, more and more anxiously.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen there,\u201d said Rouletabille, pointing toward the Emperor\u2019s cabinet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The sound of tears and sobs reached them. The grief and the remorse of\r\n\r\n      Matrena Petrovna passed the walls of the cabinet. Koupriane was completely\r\n\r\n      disconcerted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly the Emperor appeared. He was in a state of exaltation such as had\r\n\r\n      never been known in him. Koupriane, dismayed, drew back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the Tsar to him, \u201cI require that Natacha Feodorovna be\r\n\r\n      here within the next two hours, and that she be conducted with the honors\r\n\r\n      due to her rank. Natacha is innocent, and we must make reparation to her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, turning toward Rouletabille:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have learned what she knows and what she owes to you\u2014we owe to\r\n\r\n      you, my young friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Tsar said \u201cmy young friend.\u201d Rouletabille, at this last moment before\r\n\r\n      his departure, spoke Russian?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen she knows nothing, Sire. That is better, Sire, because Your Majesty\r\n\r\n      and me, we must forget right from to-day that we know anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are right,\u201d said the Tsar thoughtfully. \u201cBut, my friend, what am I to\r\n\r\n      do for you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSire, one favor. Do not let me miss the train at 10:55.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he threw himself on his knees.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRemain on your knees, my friend. You are ready, thus. Monsieur le\r\n\r\n      Marechal will prepare at once a brevet, which I will immediately sign.\r\n\r\n      Meantime, Monsieur le Marechal, find me, in my own closet, one of my St.\r\n\r\n      Anne\u2019s collars.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And it was thus that Joseph Rouletabille, of \u201cL\u2019Epoque,\u201d was created\r\n\r\n      officer of St. Anne of Russia by the Emperor himself, who gave him the\r\n\r\n      accolade.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey combine the whole course of time in this country,\u201d thought\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, pressing his hand to his eyes to hold back the tears.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      For the train at 10:55 everybody had crowded at Tsarskoie-Coelo station.\r\n\r\n      Among those who had come from St. Petersburg to press the young reporter\u2019s\r\n\r\n      hand when they learned of his impending departure were Ivan Petrovitch,\r\n\r\n      the jolly Councilor of the Emperor, and Athanase Georgevitch, the lively\r\n\r\n      advocate so well known for his famous exploits with knife and fork. They\r\n\r\n      had come naturally with all their bandages and dressings, which made them\r\n\r\n      look like glorious ruins. They brought the greetings of Feodor\r\n\r\n      Feodorovitch, who still had a little fever, and of Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff,\r\n\r\n      the Lithuanian, who had both legs broken.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Even after he was in his compartment Rouletabille had to drink his last\r\n\r\n      drink of champagne. When nothing remained in the bottle and everyone had\r\n\r\n      embraced and re-embraced him, as the train did not start quite yet,\r\n\r\n      Athanase Georgevitch opened a second \u201clast\u201d bottle. It was then that\r\n\r\n      Monsieur le Grand Marechal arrived, out of breath. They invited him to\r\n\r\n      drink, and he accepted. But he had need to speak to Rouletabille in\r\n\r\n      private, and he drew the reporter, after excuses, out into the corridor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is the Emperor himself who has sent me,\u201d said the high dignitary with\r\n\r\n      emotion. \u201cHe has sent me about the eider downs. You forgot to explain the\r\n\r\n      eider downs to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNiet!\u201d replied Rouletabille, laughing. \u201cThat is nothing. Nitchevo! His\r\n\r\n      Majesty\u2019s eider downs are of the finest eider, as one of the feathers that\r\n\r\n      you have shown me demonstrates. Well, open them now. They are a cheap\r\n\r\n      imitation, as the second feather proves. The return of the false eider\r\n\r\n      downs, before evening, proves then that they hoped the substitution would\r\n\r\n      pass undetected. That is all. Caracho! Collapse of the hoax. Your health!\r\n\r\n      Vive le Tsar!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCaracho! Caracho!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The locomotive was puffing when a couple were seen running, a man and a\r\n\r\n      woman. It was Monsieur and Madame Gounsovski.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Gounsovski stood on the running-board.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame Gounsovski has insisted upon shaking hands. You are very\r\n\r\n      congenial.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCompliments, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTell me, young man, you did wrong to fail for dinner at my house\r\n\r\n      yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI would have certainly escaped a disagreeable little journey into\r\n\r\n      Finland. I do not regret it, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The train trembled and moved. They cried, \u201cVive la France! Vive la Russe!\u201d\r\n\r\n       Athanase Georgevitch wept. Matrena Petrovna, at a window of the station,\r\n\r\n      whither she had timidly retired, waved a handkerchief to the little\r\n\r\n      domovoi-doukh, who had made her see everything in the right light, and\r\n\r\n      whom she did not dare to embrace after the terrible affair of the false\r\n\r\n      poison and the Tsar\u2019s anger.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter threw her a respectful kiss.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As he said to Gounsovski, there was nothing to be regretted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      All the same, as the train took its way toward the frontier, Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      threw himself back on the cushions, and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOuf!\u201d
PARMENIDES\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      By Plato\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Translated by Benjamin Jowett\r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      Contents\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS. \r\n\r\n\r\n PARMENIDES \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The awe with which Plato regarded the character of 'the great' Parmenides\r\n      has extended to the dialogue which he calls by his name. None of the\r\n      writings of Plato have been more copiously illustrated, both in ancient\r\n      and modern times, and in none of them have the interpreters been more at\r\n      variance with one another. Nor is this surprising. For the Parmenides is\r\n      more fragmentary and isolated than any other dialogue, and the design of\r\n      the writer is not expressly stated. The date is uncertain; the relation to\r\n      the other writings of Plato is also uncertain; the connexion between the\r\n      two parts is at first sight extremely obscure; and in the latter of the\r\n      two we are left in doubt as to whether Plato is speaking his own\r\n      sentiments by the lips of Parmenides, and overthrowing him out of his own\r\n      mouth, or whether he is propounding consequences which would have been\r\n      admitted by Zeno and Parmenides themselves. The contradictions which\r\n      follow from the hypotheses of the one and many have been regarded by some\r\n      as transcendental mysteries; by others as a mere illustration, taken at\r\n      random, of a new method. They seem to have been inspired by a sort of\r\n      dialectical frenzy, such as may be supposed to have prevailed in the\r\n      Megarian School (compare Cratylus, etc.). The criticism on his own\r\n      doctrine of Ideas has also been considered, not as a real criticism, but\r\n      as an exuberance of the metaphysical imagination which enabled Plato to go\r\n      beyond himself. To the latter part of the dialogue we may certainly apply\r\n      the words in which he himself describes the earlier philosophers in the\r\n      Sophist: 'They went on their way rather regardless of whether we\r\n      understood them or not.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The Parmenides in point of style is one of the best of the Platonic\r\n      writings; the first portion of the dialogue is in no way defective in ease\r\n      and grace and dramatic interest; nor in the second part, where there was\r\n      no room for such qualities, is there any want of clearness or precision.\r\n      The latter half is an exquisite mosaic, of which the small pieces are with\r\n      the utmost fineness and regularity adapted to one another. Like the\r\n      Protagoras, Phaedo, and others, the whole is a narrated dialogue,\r\n      combining with the mere recital of the words spoken, the observations of\r\n      the reciter on the effect produced by them. Thus we are informed by him\r\n      that Zeno and Parmenides were not altogether pleased at the request of\r\n      Socrates that they would examine into the nature of the one and many in\r\n      the sphere of Ideas, although they received his suggestion with approving\r\n      smiles. And we are glad to be told that Parmenides was 'aged but\r\n      well-favoured,' and that Zeno was 'very good-looking'; also that\r\n      Parmenides affected to decline the great argument, on which, as Zeno knew\r\n      from experience, he was not unwilling to enter. The character of Antiphon,\r\n      the half-brother of Plato, who had once been inclined to philosophy, but\r\n      has now shown the hereditary disposition for horses, is very naturally\r\n      described. He is the sole depositary of the famous dialogue; but, although\r\n      he receives the strangers like a courteous gentleman, he is impatient of\r\n      the trouble of reciting it. As they enter, he has been giving orders to a\r\n      bridle-maker; by this slight touch Plato verifies the previous description\r\n      of him. After a little persuasion he is induced to favour the\r\n      Clazomenians, who come from a distance, with a rehearsal. Respecting the\r\n      visit of Zeno and Parmenides to Athens, we may observe\u2014first, that\r\n      such a visit is consistent with dates, and may possibly have occurred;\r\n      secondly, that Plato is very likely to have invented the meeting ('You,\r\n      Socrates, can easily invent Egyptian tales or anything else,' Phaedrus);\r\n      thirdly, that no reliance can be placed on the circumstance as determining\r\n      the date of Parmenides and Zeno; fourthly, that the same occasion appears\r\n      to be referred to by Plato in two other places (Theaet., Soph.).\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Many interpreters have regarded the Parmenides as a 'reductio ad absurdum'\r\n      of the Eleatic philosophy. But would Plato have been likely to place this\r\n      in the mouth of the great Parmenides himself, who appeared to him, in\r\n      Homeric language, to be 'venerable and awful,' and to have a 'glorious\r\n      depth of mind'? (Theaet.). It may be admitted that he has ascribed to an\r\n      Eleatic stranger in the Sophist opinions which went beyond the doctrines\r\n      of the Eleatics. But the Eleatic stranger expressly criticises the\r\n      doctrines in which he had been brought up; he admits that he is going to\r\n      'lay hands on his father Parmenides.' Nothing of this kind is said of Zeno\r\n      and Parmenides. How then, without a word of explanation, could Plato\r\n      assign to them the refutation of their own tenets?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The conclusion at which we must arrive is that the Parmenides is not a\r\n      refutation of the Eleatic philosophy. Nor would such an explanation afford\r\n      any satisfactory connexion of the first and second parts of the dialogue.\r\n      And it is quite inconsistent with Plato's own relation to the Eleatics.\r\n      For of all the pre-Socratic philosophers, he speaks of them with the\r\n      greatest respect. But he could hardly have passed upon them a more\r\n      unmeaning slight than to ascribe to their great master tenets the reverse\r\n      of those which he actually held.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Two preliminary remarks may be made. First, that whatever latitude we may\r\n      allow to Plato in bringing together by a 'tour de force,' as in the\r\n      Phaedrus, dissimilar themes, yet he always in some way seeks to find a\r\n      connexion for them. Many threads join together in one the love and\r\n      dialectic of the Phaedrus. We cannot conceive that the great artist would\r\n      place in juxtaposition two absolutely divided and incoherent subjects. And\r\n      hence we are led to make a second remark: viz. that no explanation of the\r\n      Parmenides can be satisfactory which does not indicate the connexion of\r\n      the first and second parts. To suppose that Plato would first go out of\r\n      his way to make Parmenides attack the Platonic Ideas, and then proceed to\r\n      a similar but more fatal assault on his own doctrine of Being, appears to\r\n      be the height of absurdity.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Perhaps there is no passage in Plato showing greater metaphysical power\r\n      than that in which he assails his own theory of Ideas. The arguments are\r\n      nearly, if not quite, those of Aristotle; they are the objections which\r\n      naturally occur to a modern student of philosophy. Many persons will be\r\n      surprised to find Plato criticizing the very conceptions which have been\r\n      supposed in after ages to be peculiarly characteristic of him. How can he\r\n      have placed himself so completely without them? How can he have ever\r\n      persisted in them after seeing the fatal objections which might be urged\r\n      against them? The consideration of this difficulty has led a recent critic\r\n      (Ueberweg), who in general accepts the authorised canon of the Platonic\r\n      writings, to condemn the Parmenides as spurious. The accidental want of\r\n      external evidence, at first sight, seems to favour this opinion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In answer, it might be sufficient to say, that no ancient writing of equal\r\n      length and excellence is known to be spurious. Nor is the silence of\r\n      Aristotle to be hastily assumed; there is at least a doubt whether his use\r\n      of the same arguments does not involve the inference that he knew the\r\n      work. And, if the Parmenides is spurious, like Ueberweg, we are led on\r\n      further than we originally intended, to pass a similar condemnation on the\r\n      Theaetetus and Sophist, and therefore on the Politicus (compare Theaet.,\r\n      Soph.). But the objection is in reality fanciful, and rests on the\r\n      assumption that the doctrine of the Ideas was held by Plato throughout his\r\n      life in the same form. For the truth is, that the Platonic Ideas were in\r\n      constant process of growth and transmutation; sometimes veiled in poetry\r\n      and mythology, then again emerging as fixed Ideas, in some passages\r\n      regarded as absolute and eternal, and in others as relative to the human\r\n      mind, existing in and derived from external objects as well as\r\n      transcending them. The anamnesis of the Ideas is chiefly insisted upon in\r\n      the mythical portions of the dialogues, and really occupies a very small\r\n      space in the entire works of Plato. Their transcendental existence is not\r\n      asserted, and is therefore implicitly denied in the Philebus; different\r\n      forms are ascribed to them in the Republic, and they are mentioned in the\r\n      Theaetetus, the Sophist, the Politicus, and the Laws, much as Universals\r\n      would be spoken of in modern books. Indeed, there are very faint traces of\r\n      the transcendental doctrine of Ideas, that is, of their existence apart\r\n      from the mind, in any of Plato's writings, with the exception of the Meno,\r\n      the Phaedrus, the Phaedo, and in portions of the Republic. The stereotyped\r\n      form which Aristotle has given to them is not found in Plato (compare\r\n      Essay on the Platonic Ideas in the Introduction to the Meno.)\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The full discussion of this subject involves a comprehensive survey of the\r\n      philosophy of Plato, which would be out of place here. But, without\r\n      digressing further from the immediate subject of the Parmenides, we may\r\n      remark that Plato is quite serious in his objections to his own doctrines:\r\n      nor does Socrates attempt to offer any answer to them. The perplexities\r\n      which surround the one and many in the sphere of the Ideas are also\r\n      alluded to in the Philebus, and no answer is given to them. Nor have they\r\n      ever been answered, nor can they be answered by any one else who separates\r\n      the phenomenal from the real. To suppose that Plato, at a later period of\r\n      his life, reached a point of view from which he was able to answer them,\r\n      is a groundless assumption. The real progress of Plato's own mind has been\r\n      partly concealed from us by the dogmatic statements of Aristotle, and also\r\n      by the degeneracy of his own followers, with whom a doctrine of numbers\r\n      quickly superseded Ideas.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      As a preparation for answering some of the difficulties which have been\r\n      suggested, we may begin by sketching the first portion of the dialogue:\u2014\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Cephalus, of Clazomenae in Ionia, the birthplace of Anaxagoras, a citizen\r\n      of no mean city in the history of philosophy, who is the narrator of the\r\n      dialogue, describes himself as meeting Adeimantus and Glaucon in the Agora\r\n      at Athens. 'Welcome, Cephalus: can we do anything for you in Athens?'\r\n      'Why, yes: I came to ask a favour of you. First, tell me your\r\n      half-brother's name, which I have forgotten\u2014he was a mere child when\r\n      I was last here;\u2014I know his father's, which is Pyrilampes.' 'Yes,\r\n      and the name of our brother is Antiphon. But why do you ask?' 'Let me\r\n      introduce to you some countrymen of mine, who are lovers of philosophy;\r\n      they have heard that Antiphon remembers a conversation of Socrates with\r\n      Parmenides and Zeno, of which the report came to him from Pythodorus,\r\n      Zeno's friend.' 'That is quite true.' 'And can they hear the dialogue?'\r\n      'Nothing easier; in the days of his youth he made a careful study of the\r\n      piece; at present, his thoughts have another direction: he takes after his\r\n      grandfather, and has given up philosophy for horses.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      'We went to look for him, and found him giving instructions to a worker in\r\n      brass about a bridle. When he had done with him, and had learned from his\r\n      brothers the purpose of our visit, he saluted me as an old acquaintance,\r\n      and we asked him to repeat the dialogue. At first, he complained of the\r\n      trouble, but he soon consented. He told us that Pythodorus had described\r\n      to him the appearance of Parmenides and Zeno; they had come to Athens at\r\n      the great Panathenaea, the former being at the time about sixty-five years\r\n      old, aged but well-favoured\u2014Zeno, who was said to have been beloved\r\n      of Parmenides in the days of his youth, about forty, and very\r\n      good-looking:\u2014that they lodged with Pythodorus at the Ceramicus\r\n      outside the wall, whither Socrates, then a very young man, came to see\r\n      them: Zeno was reading one of his theses, which he had nearly finished,\r\n      when Pythodorus entered with Parmenides and Aristoteles, who was\r\n      afterwards one of the Thirty. When the recitation was completed, Socrates\r\n      requested that the first thesis of the treatise might be read again.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      'You mean, Zeno,' said Socrates, 'to argue that being, if it is many, must\r\n      be both like and unlike, which is a contradiction; and each division of\r\n      your argument is intended to elicit a similar absurdity, which may be\r\n      supposed to follow from the assumption that being is many.' 'Such is my\r\n      meaning.' 'I see,' said Socrates, turning to Parmenides, 'that Zeno is\r\n      your second self in his writings too; you prove admirably that the all is\r\n      one: he gives proofs no less convincing that the many are nought. To\r\n      deceive the world by saying the same thing in entirely different forms, is\r\n      a strain of art beyond most of us.' 'Yes, Socrates,' said Zeno; 'but\r\n      though you are as keen as a Spartan hound, you do not quite catch the\r\n      motive of the piece, which was only intended to protect Parmenides against\r\n      ridicule by showing that the hypothesis of the existence of the many\r\n      involved greater absurdities than the hypothesis of the one. The book was\r\n      a youthful composition of mine, which was stolen from me, and therefore I\r\n      had no choice about the publication.' 'I quite believe you,' said\r\n      Socrates; 'but will you answer me a question? I should like to know,\r\n      whether you would assume an idea of likeness in the abstract, which is the\r\n      contradictory of unlikeness in the abstract, by participation in either or\r\n      both of which things are like or unlike or partly both. For the same\r\n      things may very well partake of like and unlike in the concrete, though\r\n      like and unlike in the abstract are irreconcilable. Nor does there appear\r\n      to me to be any absurdity in maintaining that the same things may partake\r\n      of the one and many, though I should be indeed surprised to hear that the\r\n      absolute one is also many. For example, I, being many, that is to say,\r\n      having many parts or members, am yet also one, and partake of the one,\r\n      being one of seven who are here present (compare Philebus). This is not an\r\n      absurdity, but a truism. But I should be amazed if there were a similar\r\n      entanglement in the nature of the ideas themselves, nor can I believe that\r\n      one and many, like and unlike, rest and motion, in the abstract, are\r\n      capable either of admixture or of separation.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Pythodorus said that in his opinion Parmenides and Zeno were not very well\r\n      pleased at the questions which were raised; nevertheless, they looked at\r\n      one another and smiled in seeming delight and admiration of Socrates.\r\n      'Tell me,' said Parmenides, 'do you think that the abstract ideas of\r\n      likeness, unity, and the rest, exist apart from individuals which partake\r\n      of them? and is this your own distinction?' 'I think that there are such\r\n      ideas.' 'And would you make abstract ideas of the just, the beautiful, the\r\n      good?' 'Yes,' he said. 'And of human beings like ourselves, of water,\r\n      fire, and the like?' 'I am not certain.' 'And would you be undecided also\r\n      about ideas of which the mention will, perhaps, appear laughable: of hair,\r\n      mud, filth, and other things which are base and vile?' 'No, Parmenides;\r\n      visible things like these are, as I believe, only what they appear to be:\r\n      though I am sometimes disposed to imagine that there is nothing without an\r\n      idea; but I repress any such notion, from a fear of falling into an abyss\r\n      of nonsense.' 'You are young, Socrates, and therefore naturally regard the\r\n      opinions of men; the time will come when philosophy will have a firmer\r\n      hold of you, and you will not despise even the meanest things. But tell\r\n      me, is your meaning that things become like by partaking of likeness,\r\n      great by partaking of greatness, just and beautiful by partaking of\r\n      justice and beauty, and so of other ideas?' 'Yes, that is my meaning.'\r\n      'And do you suppose the individual to partake of the whole, or of the\r\n      part?' 'Why not of the whole?' said Socrates. 'Because,' said Parmenides,\r\n      'in that case the whole, which is one, will become many.' 'Nay,' said\r\n      Socrates, 'the whole may be like the day, which is one and in many places:\r\n      in this way the ideas may be one and also many.' 'In the same sort of\r\n      way,' said Parmenides, 'as a sail, which is one, may be a cover to many\u2014that\r\n      is your meaning?' 'Yes.' 'And would you say that each man is covered by\r\n      the whole sail, or by a part only?' 'By a part.' 'Then the ideas have\r\n      parts, and the objects partake of a part of them only?' 'That seems to\r\n      follow.' 'And would you like to say that the ideas are really divisible\r\n      and yet remain one?' 'Certainly not.' 'Would you venture to affirm that\r\n      great objects have a portion only of greatness transferred to them; or\r\n      that small or equal objects are small or equal because they are only\r\n      portions of smallness or equality?' 'Impossible.' 'But how can individuals\r\n      participate in ideas, except in the ways which I have mentioned?' 'That is\r\n      not an easy question to answer.' 'I should imagine the conception of ideas\r\n      to arise as follows: you see great objects pervaded by a common form or\r\n      idea of greatness, which you abstract.' 'That is quite true.' 'And\r\n      supposing you embrace in one view the idea of greatness thus gained and\r\n      the individuals which it comprises, a further idea of greatness arises,\r\n      which makes both great; and this may go on to infinity.' Socrates replies\r\n      that the ideas may be thoughts in the mind only; in this case, the\r\n      consequence would no longer follow. 'But must not the thought be of\r\n      something which is the same in all and is the idea? And if the world\r\n      partakes in the ideas, and the ideas are thoughts, must not all things\r\n      think? Or can thought be without thought?' 'I acknowledge the\r\n      unmeaningness of this,' says Socrates, 'and would rather have recourse to\r\n      the explanation that the ideas are types in nature, and that other things\r\n      partake of them by becoming like them.' 'But to become like them is to be\r\n      comprehended in the same idea; and the likeness of the idea and the\r\n      individuals implies another idea of likeness, and another without end.'\r\n      'Quite true.' 'The theory, then, of participation by likeness has to be\r\n      given up. You have hardly yet, Socrates, found out the real difficulty of\r\n      maintaining abstract ideas.' 'What difficulty?' 'The greatest of all\r\n      perhaps is this: an opponent will argue that the ideas are not within the\r\n      range of human knowledge; and you cannot disprove the assertion without a\r\n      long and laborious demonstration, which he may be unable or unwilling to\r\n      follow. In the first place, neither you nor any one who maintains the\r\n      existence of absolute ideas will affirm that they are subjective.' 'That\r\n      would be a contradiction.' 'True; and therefore any relation in these\r\n      ideas is a relation which concerns themselves only; and the objects which\r\n      are named after them, are relative to one another only, and have nothing\r\n      to do with the ideas themselves.' 'How do you mean?' said Socrates. 'I may\r\n      illustrate my meaning in this way: one of us has a slave; and the idea of\r\n      a slave in the abstract is relative to the idea of a master in the\r\n      abstract; this correspondence of ideas, however, has nothing to do with\r\n      the particular relation of our slave to us.\u2014Do you see my meaning?'\r\n      'Perfectly.' 'And absolute knowledge in the same way corresponds to\r\n      absolute truth and being, and particular knowledge to particular truth and\r\n      being.' Clearly.' 'And there is a subjective knowledge which is of\r\n      subjective truth, having many kinds, general and particular. But the ideas\r\n      themselves are not subjective, and therefore are not within our ken.'\r\n      'They are not.' 'Then the beautiful and the good in their own nature are\r\n      unknown to us?' 'It would seem so.' 'There is a worse consequence yet.'\r\n      'What is that?' 'I think we must admit that absolute knowledge is the most\r\n      exact knowledge, which we must therefore attribute to God. But then see\r\n      what follows: God, having this exact knowledge, can have no knowledge of\r\n      human things, as we have divided the two spheres, and forbidden any\r\n      passing from one to the other:\u2014the gods have knowledge and authority\r\n      in their world only, as we have in ours.' 'Yet, surely, to deprive God of\r\n      knowledge is monstrous.'\u2014'These are some of the difficulties which\r\n      are involved in the assumption of absolute ideas; the learner will find\r\n      them nearly impossible to understand, and the teacher who has to impart\r\n      them will require superhuman ability; there will always be a suspicion,\r\n      either that they have no existence, or are beyond human knowledge.' 'There\r\n      I agree with you,' said Socrates. 'Yet if these difficulties induce you to\r\n      give up universal ideas, what becomes of the mind? and where are the\r\n      reasoning and reflecting powers? philosophy is at an end.' 'I certainly do\r\n      not see my way.' 'I think,' said Parmenides, 'that this arises out of your\r\n      attempting to define abstractions, such as the good and the beautiful and\r\n      the just, before you have had sufficient previous training; I noticed your\r\n      deficiency when you were talking with Aristoteles, the day before\r\n      yesterday. Your enthusiasm is a wonderful gift; but I fear that unless you\r\n      discipline yourself by dialectic while you are young, truth will elude\r\n      your grasp.' 'And what kind of discipline would you recommend?' 'The\r\n      training which you heard Zeno practising; at the same time, I admire your\r\n      saying to him that you did not care to consider the difficulty in\r\n      reference to visible objects, but only in relation to ideas.' 'Yes;\r\n      because I think that in visible objects you may easily show any number of\r\n      inconsistent consequences.' 'Yes; and you should consider, not only the\r\n      consequences which follow from a given hypothesis, but the consequences\r\n      also which follow from the denial of the hypothesis. For example, what\r\n      follows from the assumption of the existence of the many, and the\r\n      counter-argument of what follows from the denial of the existence of the\r\n      many: and similarly of likeness and unlikeness, motion, rest, generation,\r\n      corruption, being and not being. And the consequences must include\r\n      consequences to the things supposed and to other things, in themselves and\r\n      in relation to one another, to individuals whom you select, to the many,\r\n      and to the all; these must be drawn out both on the affirmative and on the\r\n      negative hypothesis,\u2014that is, if you are to train yourself perfectly\r\n      to the intelligence of the truth.' 'What you are suggesting seems to be a\r\n      tremendous process, and one of which I do not quite understand the\r\n      nature,' said Socrates; 'will you give me an example?' 'You must not\r\n      impose such a task on a man of my years,' said Parmenides. 'Then will you,\r\n      Zeno?' 'Let us rather,' said Zeno, with a smile, 'ask Parmenides, for the\r\n      undertaking is a serious one, as he truly says; nor could I urge him to\r\n      make the attempt, except in a select audience of persons who will\r\n      understand him.' The whole party joined in the request.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Here we have, first of all, an unmistakable attack made by the youthful\r\n      Socrates on the paradoxes of Zeno. He perfectly understands their drift,\r\n      and Zeno himself is supposed to admit this. But they appear to him, as he\r\n      says in the Philebus also, to be rather truisms than paradoxes. For every\r\n      one must acknowledge the obvious fact, that the body being one has many\r\n      members, and that, in a thousand ways, the like partakes of the unlike,\r\n      the many of the one. The real difficulty begins with the relations of\r\n      ideas in themselves, whether of the one and many, or of any other ideas,\r\n      to one another and to the mind. But this was a problem which the Eleatic\r\n      philosophers had never considered; their thoughts had not gone beyond the\r\n      contradictions of matter, motion, space, and the like.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It was no wonder that Parmenides and Zeno should hear the novel\r\n      speculations of Socrates with mixed feelings of admiration and\r\n      displeasure. He was going out of the received circle of disputation into a\r\n      region in which they could hardly follow him. From the crude idea of Being\r\n      in the abstract, he was about to proceed to universals or general notions.\r\n      There is no contradiction in material things partaking of the ideas of one\r\n      and many; neither is there any contradiction in the ideas of one and many,\r\n      like and unlike, in themselves. But the contradiction arises when we\r\n      attempt to conceive ideas in their connexion, or to ascertain their\r\n      relation to phenomena. Still he affirms the existence of such ideas; and\r\n      this is the position which is now in turn submitted to the criticisms of\r\n      Parmenides.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      To appreciate truly the character of these criticisms, we must remember\r\n      the place held by Parmenides in the history of Greek philosophy. He is the\r\n      founder of idealism, and also of dialectic, or, in modern phraseology, of\r\n      metaphysics and logic (Theaet., Soph.). Like Plato, he is struggling after\r\n      something wider and deeper than satisfied the contemporary Pythagoreans.\r\n      And Plato with a true instinct recognizes him as his spiritual father,\r\n      whom he 'revered and honoured more than all other philosophers together.'\r\n      He may be supposed to have thought more than he said, or was able to\r\n      express. And, although he could not, as a matter of fact, have criticized\r\n      the ideas of Plato without an anachronism, the criticism is appropriately\r\n      placed in the mouth of the founder of the ideal philosophy.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There was probably a time in the life of Plato when the ethical teaching\r\n      of Socrates came into conflict with the metaphysical theories of the\r\n      earlier philosophers, and he sought to supplement the one by the other.\r\n      The older philosophers were great and awful; and they had the charm of\r\n      antiquity. Something which found a response in his own mind seemed to have\r\n      been lost as well as gained in the Socratic dialectic. He felt no\r\n      incongruity in the veteran Parmenides correcting the youthful Socrates.\r\n      Two points in his criticism are especially deserving of notice. First of\r\n      all, Parmenides tries him by the test of consistency. Socrates is willing\r\n      to assume ideas or principles of the just, the beautiful, the good, and to\r\n      extend them to man (compare Phaedo); but he is reluctant to admit that\r\n      there are general ideas of hair, mud, filth, etc. There is an ethical\r\n      universal or idea, but is there also a universal of physics?\u2014of the\r\n      meanest things in the world as well as of the greatest? Parmenides rebukes\r\n      this want of consistency in Socrates, which he attributes to his youth. As\r\n      he grows older, philosophy will take a firmer hold of him, and then he\r\n      will despise neither great things nor small, and he will think less of the\r\n      opinions of mankind (compare Soph.). Here is lightly touched one of the\r\n      most familiar principles of modern philosophy, that in the meanest\r\n      operations of nature, as well as in the noblest, in mud and filth, as well\r\n      as in the sun and stars, great truths are contained. At the same time, we\r\n      may note also the transition in the mind of Plato, to which Aristotle\r\n      alludes (Met.), when, as he says, he transferred the Socratic universal of\r\n      ethics to the whole of nature.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The other criticism of Parmenides on Socrates attributes to him a want of\r\n      practice in dialectic. He has observed this deficiency in him when talking\r\n      to Aristoteles on a previous occasion. Plato seems to imply that there was\r\n      something more in the dialectic of Zeno than in the mere interrogation of\r\n      Socrates. Here, again, he may perhaps be describing the process which his\r\n      own mind went through when he first became more intimately acquainted,\r\n      whether at Megara or elsewhere, with the Eleatic and Megarian\r\n      philosophers. Still, Parmenides does not deny to Socrates the credit of\r\n      having gone beyond them in seeking to apply the paradoxes of Zeno to\r\n      ideas; and this is the application which he himself makes of them in the\r\n      latter part of the dialogue. He then proceeds to explain to him the sort\r\n      of mental gymnastic which he should practise. He should consider not only\r\n      what would follow from a given hypothesis, but what would follow from the\r\n      denial of it, to that which is the subject of the hypothesis, and to all\r\n      other things. There is no trace in the Memorabilia of Xenophon of any such\r\n      method being attributed to Socrates; nor is the dialectic here spoken of\r\n      that 'favourite method' of proceeding by regular divisions, which is\r\n      described in the Phaedrus and Philebus, and of which examples are given in\r\n      the Politicus and in the Sophist. It is expressly spoken of as the method\r\n      which Socrates had heard Zeno practise in the days of his youth (compare\r\n      Soph.).\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The discussion of Socrates with Parmenides is one of the most remarkable\r\n      passages in Plato. Few writers have ever been able to anticipate 'the\r\n      criticism of the morrow' on their favourite notions. But Plato may here be\r\n      said to anticipate the judgment not only of the morrow, but of all\r\n      after-ages on the Platonic Ideas. For in some points he touches questions\r\n      which have not yet received their solution in modern philosophy.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The first difficulty which Parmenides raises respecting the Platonic ideas\r\n      relates to the manner in which individuals are connected with them. Do\r\n      they participate in the ideas, or do they merely resemble them? Parmenides\r\n      shows that objections may be urged against either of these modes of\r\n      conceiving the connection. Things are little by partaking of littleness,\r\n      great by partaking of greatness, and the like. But they cannot partake of\r\n      a part of greatness, for that will not make them great, etc.; nor can each\r\n      object monopolise the whole. The only answer to this is, that 'partaking'\r\n      is a figure of speech, really corresponding to the processes which a later\r\n      logic designates by the terms 'abstraction' and 'generalization.' When we\r\n      have described accurately the methods or forms which the mind employs, we\r\n      cannot further criticize them; at least we can only criticize them with\r\n      reference to their fitness as instruments of thought to express facts.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Socrates attempts to support his view of the ideas by the parallel of the\r\n      day, which is one and in many places; but he is easily driven from his\r\n      position by a counter illustration of Parmenides, who compares the idea of\r\n      greatness to a sail. He truly explains to Socrates that he has attained\r\n      the conception of ideas by a process of generalization. At the same time,\r\n      he points out a difficulty, which appears to be involved\u2014viz. that\r\n      the process of generalization will go on to infinity. Socrates meets the\r\n      supposed difficulty by a flash of light, which is indeed the true answer\r\n      'that the ideas are in our minds only.' Neither realism is the truth, nor\r\n      nominalism is the truth, but conceptualism; and conceptualism or any other\r\n      psychological theory falls very far short of the infinite subtlety of\r\n      language and thought.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But the realism of ancient philosophy will not admit of this answer, which\r\n      is repelled by Parmenides with another truth or half-truth of later\r\n      philosophy, 'Every subject or subjective must have an object.' Here is the\r\n      great though unconscious truth (shall we say?) or error, which underlay\r\n      the early Greek philosophy. 'Ideas must have a real existence;' they are\r\n      not mere forms or opinions, which may be changed arbitrarily by\r\n      individuals. But the early Greek philosopher never clearly saw that true\r\n      ideas were only universal facts, and that there might be error in\r\n      universals as well as in particulars.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Socrates makes one more attempt to defend the Platonic Ideas by\r\n      representing them as paradigms; this is again answered by the 'argumentum\r\n      ad infinitum.' We may remark, in passing, that the process which is thus\r\n      described has no real existence. The mind, after having obtained a general\r\n      idea, does not really go on to form another which includes that, and all\r\n      the individuals contained under it, and another and another without end.\r\n      The difficulty belongs in fact to the Megarian age of philosophy, and is\r\n      due to their illogical logic, and to the general ignorance of the ancients\r\n      respecting the part played by language in the process of thought. No such\r\n      perplexity could ever trouble a modern metaphysician, any more than the\r\n      fallacy of 'calvus' or 'acervus,' or of 'Achilles and the tortoise.' These\r\n      'surds' of metaphysics ought to occasion no more difficulty in speculation\r\n      than a perpetually recurring fraction in arithmetic.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It is otherwise with the objection which follows: How are we to bridge the\r\n      chasm between human truth and absolute truth, between gods and men? This\r\n      is the difficulty of philosophy in all ages: How can we get beyond the\r\n      circle of our own ideas, or how, remaining within them, can we have any\r\n      criterion of a truth beyond and independent of them? Parmenides draws out\r\n      this difficulty with great clearness. According to him, there are not only\r\n      one but two chasms: the first, between individuals and the ideas which\r\n      have a common name; the second, between the ideas in us and the ideas\r\n      absolute. The first of these two difficulties mankind, as we may say, a\r\n      little parodying the language of the Philebus, have long agreed to treat\r\n      as obsolete; the second remains a difficulty for us as well as for the\r\n      Greeks of the fourth century before Christ, and is the stumbling-block of\r\n      Kant's Kritik, and of the Hamiltonian adaptation of Kant, as well as of\r\n      the Platonic ideas. It has been said that 'you cannot criticize\r\n      Revelation.' 'Then how do you know what is Revelation, or that there is\r\n      one at all,' is the immediate rejoinder\u2014'You know nothing of things\r\n      in themselves.' 'Then how do you know that there are things in\r\n      themselves?' In some respects, the difficulty pressed harder upon the\r\n      Greek than upon ourselves. For conceiving of God more under the attribute\r\n      of knowledge than we do, he was more under the necessity of separating the\r\n      divine from the human, as two spheres which had no communication with one\r\n      another.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It is remarkable that Plato, speaking by the mouth of Parmenides, does not\r\n      treat even this second class of difficulties as hopeless or insoluble. He\r\n      says only that they cannot be explained without a long and laborious\r\n      demonstration: 'The teacher will require superhuman ability, and the\r\n      learner will be hard of understanding.' But an attempt must be made to\r\n      find an answer to them; for, as Socrates and Parmenides both admit, the\r\n      denial of abstract ideas is the destruction of the mind. We can easily\r\n      imagine that among the Greek schools of philosophy in the fourth century\r\n      before Christ a panic might arise from the denial of universals, similar\r\n      to that which arose in the last century from Hume's denial of our ideas of\r\n      cause and effect. Men do not at first recognize that thought, like\r\n      digestion, will go on much the same, notwithstanding any theories which\r\n      may be entertained respecting the nature of the process. Parmenides\r\n      attributes the difficulties in which Socrates is involved to a want of\r\n      comprehensiveness in his mode of reasoning; he should consider every\r\n      question on the negative as well as the positive hypothesis, with\r\n      reference to the consequences which flow from the denial as well as from\r\n      the assertion of a given statement.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The argument which follows is the most singular in Plato. It appears to be\r\n      an imitation, or parody, of the Zenonian dialectic, just as the speeches\r\n      in the Phaedrus are an imitation of the style of Lysias, or as the\r\n      derivations in the Cratylus or the fallacies of the Euthydemus are a\r\n      parody of some contemporary Sophist. The interlocutor is not supposed, as\r\n      in most of the other Platonic dialogues, to take a living part in the\r\n      argument; he is only required to say 'Yes' and 'No' in the right places. A\r\n      hint has been already given that the paradoxes of Zeno admitted of a\r\n      higher application. This hint is the thread by which Plato connects the\r\n      two parts of the dialogue.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The paradoxes of Parmenides seem trivial to us, because the words to which\r\n      they relate have become trivial; their true nature as abstract terms is\r\n      perfectly understood by us, and we are inclined to regard the treatment of\r\n      them in Plato as a mere straw-splitting, or legerdemain of words. Yet\r\n      there was a power in them which fascinated the Neoplatonists for centuries\r\n      afterwards. Something that they found in them, or brought to them\u2014some\r\n      echo or anticipation of a great truth or error, exercised a wonderful\r\n      influence over their minds. To do the Parmenides justice, we should\r\n      imagine similar aporiai raised on themes as sacred to us, as the notions\r\n      of One or Being were to an ancient Eleatic. 'If God is, what follows? If\r\n      God is not, what follows?' Or again: If God is or is not the world; or if\r\n      God is or is not many, or has or has not parts, or is or is not in the\r\n      world, or in time; or is or is not finite or infinite. Or if the world is\r\n      or is not; or has or has not a beginning or end; or is or is not infinite,\r\n      or infinitely divisible. Or again: if God is or is not identical with his\r\n      laws; or if man is or is not identical with the laws of nature. We can\r\n      easily see that here are many subjects for thought, and that from these\r\n      and similar hypotheses questions of great interest might arise. And we\r\n      also remark, that the conclusions derived from either of the two\r\n      alternative propositions might be equally impossible and contradictory.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      When we ask what is the object of these paradoxes, some have answered that\r\n      they are a mere logical puzzle, while others have seen in them an Hegelian\r\n      propaedeutic of the doctrine of Ideas. The first of these views derives\r\n      support from the manner in which Parmenides speaks of a similar method\r\n      being applied to all Ideas. Yet it is hard to suppose that Plato would\r\n      have furnished so elaborate an example, not of his own but of the Eleatic\r\n      dialectic, had he intended only to give an illustration of method. The\r\n      second view has been often overstated by those who, like Hegel himself,\r\n      have tended to confuse ancient with modern philosophy. We need not deny\r\n      that Plato, trained in the school of Cratylus and Heracleitus, may have\r\n      seen that a contradiction in terms is sometimes the best expression of a\r\n      truth higher than either (compare Soph.). But his ideal theory is not\r\n      based on antinomies. The correlation of Ideas was the metaphysical\r\n      difficulty of the age in which he lived; and the Megarian and Cynic\r\n      philosophy was a 'reductio ad absurdum' of their isolation. To restore\r\n      them to their natural connexion and to detect the negative element in them\r\n      is the aim of Plato in the Sophist. But his view of their connexion falls\r\n      very far short of the Hegelian identity of Being and Not-being. The Being\r\n      and Not-being of Plato never merge in each other, though he is aware that\r\n      'determination is only negation.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      After criticizing the hypotheses of others, it may appear presumptuous to\r\n      add another guess to the many which have been already offered. May we say,\r\n      in Platonic language, that we still seem to see vestiges of a track which\r\n      has not yet been taken? It is quite possible that the obscurity of the\r\n      Parmenides would not have existed to a contemporary student of philosophy,\r\n      and, like the similar difficulty in the Philebus, is really due to our\r\n      ignorance of the mind of the age. There is an obscure Megarian influence\r\n      on Plato which cannot wholly be cleared up, and is not much illustrated by\r\n      the doubtful tradition of his retirement to Megara after the death of\r\n      Socrates. For Megara was within a walk of Athens (Phaedr.), and Plato\r\n      might have learned the Megarian doctrines without settling there.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      We may begin by remarking that the theses of Parmenides are expressly said\r\n      to follow the method of Zeno, and that the complex dilemma, though\r\n      declared to be capable of universal application, is applied in this\r\n      instance to Zeno's familiar question of the 'one and many.' Here, then, is\r\n      a double indication of the connexion of the Parmenides with the Eristic\r\n      school. The old Eleatics had asserted the existence of Being, which they\r\n      at first regarded as finite, then as infinite, then as neither finite nor\r\n      infinite, to which some of them had given what Aristotle calls 'a form,'\r\n      others had ascribed a material nature only. The tendency of their\r\n      philosophy was to deny to Being all predicates. The Megarians, who\r\n      succeeded them, like the Cynics, affirmed that no predicate could be\r\n      asserted of any subject; they also converted the idea of Being into an\r\n      abstraction of Good, perhaps with the view of preserving a sort of\r\n      neutrality or indifference between the mind and things. As if they had\r\n      said, in the language of modern philosophy: 'Being is not only neither\r\n      finite nor infinite, neither at rest nor in motion, but neither subjective\r\n      nor objective.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      This is the track along which Plato is leading us. Zeno had attempted to\r\n      prove the existence of the one by disproving the existence of the many,\r\n      and Parmenides seems to aim at proving the existence of the subject by\r\n      showing the contradictions which follow from the assertion of any\r\n      predicates. Take the simplest of all notions, 'unity'; you cannot even\r\n      assert being or time of this without involving a contradiction. But is the\r\n      contradiction also the final conclusion? Probably no more than of Zeno's\r\n      denial of the many, or of Parmenides' assault upon the Ideas; no more than\r\n      of the earlier dialogues 'of search.' To us there seems to be no residuum\r\n      of this long piece of dialectics. But to the mind of Parmenides and Plato,\r\n      'Gott-betrunkene Menschen,' there still remained the idea of 'being' or\r\n      'good,' which could not be conceived, defined, uttered, but could not be\r\n      got rid of. Neither of them would have imagined that their disputation\r\n      ever touched the Divine Being (compare Phil.). The same difficulties about\r\n      Unity and Being are raised in the Sophist; but there only as preliminary\r\n      to their final solution.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If this view is correct, the real aim of the hypotheses of Parmenides is\r\n      to criticize the earlier Eleatic philosophy from the point of view of Zeno\r\n      or the Megarians. It is the same kind of criticism which Plato has\r\n      extended to his own doctrine of Ideas. Nor is there any want of poetical\r\n      consistency in attributing to the 'father Parmenides' the last review of\r\n      the Eleatic doctrines. The latest phases of all philosophies were fathered\r\n      upon the founder of the school.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Other critics have regarded the final conclusion of the Parmenides either\r\n      as sceptical or as Heracleitean. In the first case, they assume that Plato\r\n      means to show the impossibility of any truth. But this is not the spirit\r\n      of Plato, and could not with propriety be put into the mouth of\r\n      Parmenides, who, in this very dialogue, is urging Socrates, not to doubt\r\n      everything, but to discipline his mind with a view to the more precise\r\n      attainment of truth. The same remark applies to the second of the two\r\n      theories. Plato everywhere ridicules (perhaps unfairly) his Heracleitean\r\n      contemporaries: and if he had intended to support an Heracleitean thesis,\r\n      would hardly have chosen Parmenides, the condemner of the 'undiscerning\r\n      tribe who say that things both are and are not,' to be the speaker. Nor,\r\n      thirdly, can we easily persuade ourselves with Zeller that by the 'one' he\r\n      means the Idea; and that he is seeking to prove indirectly the unity of\r\n      the Idea in the multiplicity of phenomena.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      We may now endeavour to thread the mazes of the labyrinth which Parmenides\r\n      knew so well, and trembled at the thought of them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The argument has two divisions: There is the hypothesis that\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      .....\r\n    \r\n\r\n      'I cannot refuse,' said Parmenides, 'since, as Zeno remarks, we are alone,\r\n      though I may say with Ibycus, who in his old age fell in love, I, like the\r\n      old racehorse, tremble at the prospect of the course which I am to run,\r\n      and which I know so well. But as I must attempt this laborious game, what\r\n      shall be the subject? Suppose I take my own hypothesis of the one.' 'By\r\n      all means,' said Zeno. 'And who will answer me? Shall I propose the\r\n      youngest? he will be the most likely to say what he thinks, and his\r\n      answers will give me time to breathe.' 'I am the youngest,' said\r\n      Aristoteles, 'and at your service; proceed with your questions.'\u2014The\r\n      result may be summed up as follows:\u2014\r\n    \r\n\r\n      1.a. One is not many, and therefore has no parts, and therefore is not a\r\n      whole, which is a sum of parts, and therefore has neither beginning,\r\n      middle, nor end, and is therefore unlimited, and therefore formless, being\r\n      neither round nor straight, for neither round nor straight can be defined\r\n      without assuming that they have parts; and therefore is not in place,\r\n      whether in another which would encircle and touch the one at many points;\r\n      or in itself, because that which is self-containing is also contained, and\r\n      therefore not one but two. This being premised, let us consider whether\r\n      one is capable either of motion or rest. For motion is either change of\r\n      substance, or motion on an axis, or from one place to another. But the one\r\n      is incapable of change of substance, which implies that it ceases to be\r\n      itself, or of motion on an axis, because there would be parts around the\r\n      axis; and any other motion involves change of place. But existence in\r\n      place has been already shown to be impossible; and yet more impossible is\r\n      coming into being in place, which implies partial existence in two places\r\n      at once, or entire existence neither within nor without the same; and how\r\n      can this be? And more impossible still is the coming into being either as\r\n      a whole or parts of that which is neither a whole nor parts. The one,\r\n      then, is incapable of motion. But neither can the one be in anything, and\r\n      therefore not in the same, whether itself or some other, and is therefore\r\n      incapable of rest. Neither is one the same with itself or any other, or\r\n      other than itself or any other. For if other than itself, then other than\r\n      one, and therefore not one; and, if the same with other, it would be\r\n      other, and other than one. Neither can one while remaining one be other\r\n      than other; for other, and not one, is the other than other. But if not\r\n      other by virtue of being one, not by virtue of itself; and if not by\r\n      virtue of itself, not itself other, and if not itself other, not other\r\n      than anything. Neither will one be the same with itself. For the nature of\r\n      the same is not that of the one, but a thing which becomes the same with\r\n      anything does not become one; for example, that which becomes the same\r\n      with the many becomes many and not one. And therefore if the one is the\r\n      same with itself, the one is not one with itself; and therefore one and\r\n      not one. And therefore one is neither other than other, nor the same with\r\n      itself. Neither will the one be like or unlike itself or other; for\r\n      likeness is sameness of affections, and the one and the same are\r\n      different. And one having any affection which is other than being one\r\n      would be more than one. The one, then, cannot have the same affection with\r\n      and therefore cannot be like itself or other; nor can the one have any\r\n      other affection than its own, that is, be unlike itself or any other, for\r\n      this would imply that it was more than one. The one, then, is neither like\r\n      nor unlike itself or other. This being the case, neither can the one be\r\n      equal or unequal to itself or other. For equality implies sameness of\r\n      measure, as inequality implies a greater or less number of measures. But\r\n      the one, not having sameness, cannot have sameness of measure; nor a\r\n      greater or less number of measures, for that would imply parts and\r\n      multitude. Once more, can one be older or younger than itself or other? or\r\n      of the same age with itself or other? That would imply likeness and\r\n      unlikeness, equality and inequality. Therefore one cannot be in time,\r\n      because that which is in time is ever becoming older and younger than\r\n      itself, (for older and younger are relative terms, and he who becomes\r\n      older becomes younger,) and is also of the same age with itself. None of\r\n      which, or any other expressions of time, whether past, future, or present,\r\n      can be affirmed of one. One neither is, has been, nor will be, nor\r\n      becomes, nor has, nor will become. And, as these are the only modes of\r\n      being, one is not, and is not one. But to that which is not, there is no\r\n      attribute or relative, neither name nor word nor idea nor science nor\r\n      perception nor opinion appertaining. One, then, is neither named, nor\r\n      uttered, nor known, nor perceived, nor imagined. But can all this be true?\r\n      'I think not.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      1.b. Let us, however, commence the inquiry again. We have to work out all\r\n      the consequences which follow on the assumption that the one is. If one\r\n      is, one partakes of being, which is not the same with one; the words\r\n      'being' and 'one' have different meanings. Observe the consequence: In the\r\n      one of being or the being of one are two parts, being and one, which form\r\n      one whole. And each of the two parts is also a whole, and involves the\r\n      other, and may be further subdivided into one and being, and is therefore\r\n      not one but two; and thus one is never one, and in this way the one, if it\r\n      is, becomes many and infinite. Again, let us conceive of a one which by an\r\n      effort of abstraction we separate from being: will this abstract one be\r\n      one or many? You say one only; let us see. In the first place, the being\r\n      of one is other than one; and one and being, if different, are so because\r\n      they both partake of the nature of other, which is therefore neither one\r\n      nor being; and whether we take being and other, or being and one, or one\r\n      and other, in any case we have two things which separately are called\r\n      either, and together both. And both are two and either of two is severally\r\n      one, and if one be added to any of the pairs, the sum is three; and two is\r\n      an even number, three an odd; and two units exist twice, and therefore\r\n      there are twice two; and three units exist thrice, and therefore there are\r\n      thrice three, and taken together they give twice three and thrice two: we\r\n      have even numbers multiplied into even, and odd into even, and even into\r\n      odd numbers. But if one is, and both odd and even numbers are implied in\r\n      one, must not every number exist? And number is infinite, and therefore\r\n      existence must be infinite, for all and every number partakes of being;\r\n      therefore being has the greatest number of parts, and every part, however\r\n      great or however small, is equally one. But can one be in many places and\r\n      yet be a whole? If not a whole it must be divided into parts and\r\n      represented by a number corresponding to the number of the parts. And if\r\n      so, we were wrong in saying that being has the greatest number of parts;\r\n      for being is coequal and coextensive with one, and has no more parts than\r\n      one; and so the abstract one broken up into parts by being is many and\r\n      infinite. But the parts are parts of a whole, and the whole is their\r\n      containing limit, and the one is therefore limited as well as infinite in\r\n      number; and that which is a whole has beginning, middle, and end, and a\r\n      middle is equidistant from the extremes; and one is therefore of a certain\r\n      figure, round or straight, or a combination of the two, and being a whole\r\n      includes all the parts which are the whole, and is therefore\r\n      self-contained. But then, again, the whole is not in the parts, whether\r\n      all or some. Not in all, because, if in all, also in one; for, if wanting\r\n      in any one, how in all?\u2014not in some, because the greater would then\r\n      be contained in the less. But if not in all, nor in any, nor in some,\r\n      either nowhere or in other. And if nowhere, nothing; therefore in other.\r\n      The one as a whole, then, is in another, but regarded as a sum of parts is\r\n      in itself; and is, therefore, both in itself and in another. This being\r\n      the case, the one is at once both at rest and in motion: at rest, because\r\n      resting in itself; in motion, because it is ever in other. And if there is\r\n      truth in what has preceded, one is the same and not the same with itself\r\n      and other. For everything in relation to every other thing is either the\r\n      same with it or other; or if neither the same nor other, then in the\r\n      relation of part to a whole or whole to a part. But one cannot be a part\r\n      or whole in relation to one, nor other than one; and is therefore the same\r\n      with one. Yet this sameness is again contradicted by one being in another\r\n      place from itself which is in the same place; this follows from one being\r\n      in itself and in another; one, therefore, is other than itself. But if\r\n      anything is other than anything, will it not be other than other? And the\r\n      not one is other than the one, and the one than the not one; therefore one\r\n      is other than all others. But the same and the other exclude one another,\r\n      and therefore the other can never be in the same; nor can the other be in\r\n      anything for ever so short a time, as for that time the other will be in\r\n      the same. And the other, if never in the same, cannot be either in the one\r\n      or in the not one. And one is not other than not one, either by reason of\r\n      other or of itself; and therefore they are not other than one another at\r\n      all. Neither can the not one partake or be part of one, for in that case\r\n      it would be one; nor can the not one be number, for that also involves\r\n      one. And therefore, not being other than the one or related to the one as\r\n      a whole to parts or parts to a whole, not one is the same as one.\r\n      Wherefore the one is the same and also not the same with the others and\r\n      also with itself; and is therefore like and unlike itself and the others,\r\n      and just as different from the others as they are from the one, neither\r\n      more nor less. But if neither more nor less, equally different; and\r\n      therefore the one and the others have the same relations. This may be\r\n      illustrated by the case of names: when you repeat the same name twice\r\n      over, you mean the same thing; and when you say that the other is other\r\n      than the one, or the one other than the other, this very word other\r\n      (eteron), which is attributed to both, implies sameness. One, then, as\r\n      being other than others, and other as being other than one, are alike in\r\n      that they have the relation of otherness; and likeness is similarity of\r\n      relations. And everything as being other of everything is also like\r\n      everything. Again, same and other, like and unlike, are opposites: and\r\n      since in virtue of being other than the others the one is like them, in\r\n      virtue of being the same it must be unlike. Again, one, as having the same\r\n      relations, has no difference of relation, and is therefore not unlike, and\r\n      therefore like; or, as having different relations, is different and\r\n      unlike. Thus, one, as being the same and not the same with itself and\r\n      others\u2014for both these reasons and for either of them\u2014is also\r\n      like and unlike itself and the others. Again, how far can one touch itself\r\n      and the others? As existing in others, it touches the others; and as\r\n      existing in itself, touches only itself. But from another point of view,\r\n      that which touches another must be next in order of place; one, therefore,\r\n      must be next in order of place to itself, and would therefore be two, and\r\n      in two places. But one cannot be two, and therefore cannot be in contact\r\n      with itself. Nor again can one touch the other. Two objects are required\r\n      to make one contact; three objects make two contacts; and all the objects\r\n      in the world, if placed in a series, would have as many contacts as there\r\n      are objects, less one. But if one only exists, and not two, there is no\r\n      contact. And the others, being other than one, have no part in one, and\r\n      therefore none in number, and therefore two has no existence, and\r\n      therefore there is no contact. For all which reasons, one has and has not\r\n      contact with itself and the others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Once more, Is one equal and unequal to itself and the others? Suppose one\r\n      and the others to be greater or less than each other or equal to one\r\n      another, they will be greater or less or equal by reason of equality or\r\n      greatness or smallness inhering in them in addition to their own proper\r\n      nature. Let us begin by assuming smallness to be inherent in one: in this\r\n      case the inherence is either in the whole or in a part. If the first,\r\n      smallness is either coextensive with the whole one, or contains the whole,\r\n      and, if coextensive with the one, is equal to the one, or if containing\r\n      the one will be greater than the one. But smallness thus performs the\r\n      function of equality or of greatness, which is impossible. Again, if the\r\n      inherence be in a part, the same contradiction follows: smallness will be\r\n      equal to the part or greater than the part; therefore smallness will not\r\n      inhere in anything, and except the idea of smallness there will be nothing\r\n      small. Neither will greatness; for greatness will have a greater;\u2014and\r\n      there will be no small in relation to which it is great. And there will be\r\n      no great or small in objects, but greatness and smallness will be relative\r\n      only to each other; therefore the others cannot be greater or less than\r\n      the one; also the one can neither exceed nor be exceeded by the others,\r\n      and they are therefore equal to one another. And this will be true also of\r\n      the one in relation to itself: one will be equal to itself as well as to\r\n      the others (talla). Yet one, being in itself, must also be about itself,\r\n      containing and contained, and is therefore greater and less than itself.\r\n      Further, there is nothing beside the one and the others; and as these must\r\n      be in something, they must therefore be in one another; and as that in\r\n      which a thing is is greater than the thing, the inference is that they are\r\n      both greater and less than one another, because containing and contained\r\n      in one another. Therefore the one is equal to and greater and less than\r\n      itself or other, having also measures or parts or numbers equal to or\r\n      greater or less than itself or other.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But does one partake of time? This must be acknowledged, if the one\r\n      partakes of being. For 'to be' is the participation of being in present\r\n      time, 'to have been' in past, 'to be about to be' in future time. And as\r\n      time is ever moving forward, the one becomes older than itself; and\r\n      therefore younger than itself; and is older and also younger when in the\r\n      process of becoming it arrives at the present; and it is always older and\r\n      younger, for at any moment the one is, and therefore it becomes and is not\r\n      older and younger than itself but during an equal time with itself, and is\r\n      therefore contemporary with itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And what are the relations of the one to the others? Is it or does it\r\n      become older or younger than they? At any rate the others are more than\r\n      one, and one, being the least of all numbers, must be prior in time to\r\n      greater numbers. But on the other hand, one must come into being in a\r\n      manner accordant with its own nature. Now one has parts or others, and has\r\n      therefore a beginning, middle, and end, of which the beginning is first\r\n      and the end last. And the parts come into existence first; last of all the\r\n      whole, contemporaneously with the end, being therefore younger, while the\r\n      parts or others are older than the one. But, again, the one comes into\r\n      being in each of the parts as much as in the whole, and must be of the\r\n      same age with them. Therefore one is at once older and younger than the\r\n      parts or others, and also contemporaneous with them, for no part can be a\r\n      part which is not one. Is this true of becoming as well as being? Thus\r\n      much may be affirmed, that the same things which are older or younger\r\n      cannot become older or younger in a greater degree than they were at first\r\n      by the addition of equal times. But, on the other hand, the one, if older\r\n      than others, has come into being a longer time than they have. And when\r\n      equal time is added to a longer and shorter, the relative difference\r\n      between them is diminished. In this way that which was older becomes\r\n      younger, and that which was younger becomes older, that is to say, younger\r\n      and older than at first; and they ever become and never have become, for\r\n      then they would be. Thus the one and others always are and are becoming\r\n      and not becoming younger and also older than one another. And one,\r\n      partaking of time and also partaking of becoming older and younger, admits\r\n      of all time, present, past, and future\u2014was, is, shall be\u2014was\r\n      becoming, is becoming, will become. And there is science of the one, and\r\n      opinion and name and expression, as is already implied in the fact of our\r\n      inquiry.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yet once more, if one be one and many, and neither one nor many, and also\r\n      participant of time, must there not be a time at which one as being one\r\n      partakes of being, and a time when one as not being one is deprived of\r\n      being? But these two contradictory states cannot be experienced by the one\r\n      both together: there must be a time of transition. And the transition is a\r\n      process of generation and destruction, into and from being and not-being,\r\n      the one and the others. For the generation of the one is the destruction\r\n      of the others, and the generation of the others is the destruction of the\r\n      one. There is also separation and aggregation, assimilation and\r\n      dissimilation, increase, diminution, equalization, a passage from motion\r\n      to rest, and from rest to motion in the one and many. But when do all\r\n      these changes take place? When does motion become rest, or rest motion?\r\n      The answer to this question will throw a light upon all the others.\r\n      Nothing can be in motion and at rest at the same time; and therefore the\r\n      change takes place 'in a moment'\u2014which is a strange expression, and\r\n      seems to mean change in no time. Which is true also of all the other\r\n      changes, which likewise take place in no time.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      1.aa. But if one is, what happens to the others, which in the first place\r\n      are not one, yet may partake of one in a certain way? The others are other\r\n      than the one because they have parts, for if they had no parts they would\r\n      be simply one, and parts imply a whole to which they belong; otherwise\r\n      each part would be a part of many, and being itself one of them, of\r\n      itself, and if a part of all, of each one of the other parts, which is\r\n      absurd. For a part, if not a part of one, must be a part of all but this\r\n      one, and if so not a part of each one; and if not a part of each one, not\r\n      a part of any one of many, and so not of one; and if of none, how of all?\r\n      Therefore a part is neither a part of many nor of all, but of an absolute\r\n      and perfect whole or one. And if the others have parts, they must partake\r\n      of the whole, and must be the whole of which they are the parts. And each\r\n      part, as the word 'each' implies, is also an absolute one. And both the\r\n      whole and the parts partake of one, for the whole of which the parts are\r\n      parts is one, and each part is one part of the whole; and whole and parts\r\n      as participating in one are other than one, and as being other than one\r\n      are many and infinite; and however small a fraction you separate from them\r\n      is many and not one. Yet the fact of their being parts furnishes the\r\n      others with a limit towards other parts and towards the whole; they are\r\n      finite and also infinite: finite through participation in the one,\r\n      infinite in their own nature. And as being finite, they are alike; and as\r\n      being infinite, they are alike; but as being both finite and also\r\n      infinite, they are in the highest degree unlike. And all other opposites\r\n      might without difficulty be shown to unite in them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      1.bb. Once more, leaving all this: Is there not also an opposite series of\r\n      consequences which is equally true of the others, and may be deduced from\r\n      the existence of one? There is. One is distinct from the others, and the\r\n      others from one; for one and the others are all things, and there is no\r\n      third existence besides them. And the whole of one cannot be in others nor\r\n      parts of it, for it is separated from others and has no parts, and\r\n      therefore the others have no unity, nor plurality, nor duality, nor any\r\n      other number, nor any opposition or distinction, such as likeness and\r\n      unlikeness, some and other, generation and corruption, odd and even. For\r\n      if they had these they would partake either of one opposite, and this\r\n      would be a participation in one; or of two opposites, and this would be a\r\n      participation in two. Thus if one exists, one is all things, and likewise\r\n      nothing, in relation to one and to the others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      2.a. But, again, assume the opposite hypothesis, that the one is not, and\r\n      what is the consequence? In the first place, the proposition, that one is\r\n      not, is clearly opposed to the proposition, that not one is not. The\r\n      subject of any negative proposition implies at once knowledge and\r\n      difference. Thus 'one' in the proposition\u2014'The one is not,' must be\r\n      something known, or the words would be unintelligible; and again this 'one\r\n      which is not' is something different from other things. Moreover, this and\r\n      that, some and other, may be all attributed or related to the one which is\r\n      not, and which though non-existent may and must have plurality, if the one\r\n      only is non-existent and nothing else; but if all is not-being there is\r\n      nothing which can be spoken of. Also the one which is not differs, and is\r\n      different in kind from the others, and therefore unlike them; and they\r\n      being other than the one, are unlike the one, which is therefore unlike\r\n      them. But one, being unlike other, must be like itself; for the unlikeness\r\n      of one to itself is the destruction of the hypothesis; and one cannot be\r\n      equal to the others; for that would suppose being in the one, and the\r\n      others would be equal to one and like one; both which are impossible, if\r\n      one does not exist. The one which is not, then, if not equal is unequal to\r\n      the others, and in equality implies great and small, and equality lies\r\n      between great and small, and therefore the one which is not partakes of\r\n      equality. Further, the one which is not has being; for that which is true\r\n      is, and it is true that the one is not. And so the one which is not, if\r\n      remitting aught of the being of non-existence, would become existent. For\r\n      not being implies the being of not-being, and being the not-being of\r\n      not-being; or more truly being partakes of the being of being and not of\r\n      the being of not-being, and not-being of the being of not-being and not of\r\n      the not-being of not-being. And therefore the one which is not has being\r\n      and also not-being. And the union of being and not-being involves change\r\n      or motion. But how can not-being, which is nowhere, move or change, either\r\n      from one place to another or in the same place? And whether it is or is\r\n      not, it would cease to be one if experiencing a change of substance. The\r\n      one which is not, then, is both in motion and at rest, is altered and\r\n      unaltered, and becomes and is destroyed, and does not become and is not\r\n      destroyed.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      2.b. Once more, let us ask the question, If one is not, what happens in\r\n      regard to one? The expression 'is not' implies negation of being:\u2014do\r\n      we mean by this to say that a thing, which is not, in a certain sense is?\r\n      or do we mean absolutely to deny being of it? The latter. Then the one\r\n      which is not can neither be nor become nor perish nor experience change of\r\n      substance or place. Neither can rest, or motion, or greatness, or\r\n      smallness, or equality, or unlikeness, or likeness either to itself or\r\n      other, or attribute or relation, or now or hereafter or formerly, or\r\n      knowledge or opinion or perception or name or anything else be asserted of\r\n      that which is not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      2.aa. Once more, if one is not, what becomes of the others? If we speak of\r\n      them they must be, and their very name implies difference, and difference\r\n      implies relation, not to the one, which is not, but to one another. And\r\n      they are others of each other not as units but as infinities, the least of\r\n      which is also infinity, and capable of infinitesimal division. And they\r\n      will have no unity or number, but only a semblance of unity and number;\r\n      and the least of them will appear large and manifold in comparison with\r\n      the infinitesimal fractions into which it may be divided. Further, each\r\n      particle will have the appearance of being equal with the fractions. For\r\n      in passing from the greater to the less it must reach an intermediate\r\n      point, which is equality. Moreover, each particle although having a limit\r\n      in relation to itself and to other particles, yet it has neither\r\n      beginning, middle, nor end; for there is always a beginning before the\r\n      beginning, and a middle within the middle, and an end beyond the end,\r\n      because the infinitesimal division is never arrested by the one. Thus all\r\n      being is one at a distance, and broken up when near, and like at a\r\n      distance and unlike when near; and also the particles which compose being\r\n      seem to be like and unlike, in rest and motion, in generation and\r\n      corruption, in contact and separation, if one is not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      2.bb. Once more, let us inquire, If the one is not, and the others of the\r\n      one are, what follows? In the first place, the others will not be the one,\r\n      nor the many, for in that case the one would be contained in them; neither\r\n      will they appear to be one or many; because they have no communion or\r\n      participation in that which is not, nor semblance of that which is not. If\r\n      one is not, the others neither are, nor appear to be one or many, like or\r\n      unlike, in contact or separation. In short, if one is not, nothing is.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The result of all which is, that whether one is or is not, one and the\r\n      others, in relation to themselves and to one another, are and are not, and\r\n      appear to be and appear not to be, in all manner of ways.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I. On the first hypothesis we may remark: first, That one is one is an\r\n      identical proposition, from which we might expect that no further\r\n      consequences could be deduced. The train of consequences which follows, is\r\n      inferred by altering the predicate into 'not many.' Yet, perhaps, if a\r\n      strict Eristic had been present, oios aner ei kai nun paren, he might have\r\n      affirmed that the not many presented a different aspect of the conception\r\n      from the one, and was therefore not identical with it. Such a subtlety\r\n      would be very much in character with the Zenonian dialectic. Secondly, We\r\n      may note, that the conclusion is really involved in the premises. For one\r\n      is conceived as one, in a sense which excludes all predicates. When the\r\n      meaning of one has been reduced to a point, there is no use in saying that\r\n      it has neither parts nor magnitude. Thirdly, The conception of the same\r\n      is, first of all, identified with the one; and then by a further analysis\r\n      distinguished from, and even opposed to it. Fourthly, We may detect\r\n      notions, which have reappeared in modern philosophy, e.g. the bare\r\n      abstraction of undefined unity, answering to the Hegelian 'Seyn,' or the\r\n      identity of contradictions 'that which is older is also younger,' etc., or\r\n      the Kantian conception of an a priori synthetical proposition 'one is.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      II. In the first series of propositions the word 'is' is really the\r\n      copula; in the second, the verb of existence. As in the first series, the\r\n      negative consequence followed from one being affirmed to be equivalent to\r\n      the not many; so here the affirmative consequence is deduced from one\r\n      being equivalent to the many.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In the former case, nothing could be predicated of the one, but now\r\n      everything\u2014multitude, relation, place, time, transition. One is\r\n      regarded in all the aspects of one, and with a reference to all the\r\n      consequences which flow, either from the combination or the separation of\r\n      them. The notion of transition involves the singular extra-temporal\r\n      conception of 'suddenness.' This idea of 'suddenness' is based upon the\r\n      contradiction which is involved in supposing that anything can be in two\r\n      places at once. It is a mere fiction; and we may observe that similar\r\n      antinomies have led modern philosophers to deny the reality of time and\r\n      space. It is not the infinitesimal of time, but the negative of time. By\r\n      the help of this invention the conception of change, which sorely\r\n      exercised the minds of early thinkers, seems to be, but is not really at\r\n      all explained. The difficulty arises out of the imperfection of language,\r\n      and should therefore be no longer regarded as a difficulty at all. The\r\n      only way of meeting it, if it exists, is to acknowledge that this rather\r\n      puzzling double conception is necessary to the expression of the phenomena\r\n      of motion or change, and that this and similar double notions, instead of\r\n      being anomalies, are among the higher and more potent instruments of human\r\n      thought.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The processes by which Parmenides obtains his remarkable results may be\r\n      summed up as follows: (1) Compound or correlative ideas which involve each\r\n      other, such as, being and not-being, one and many, are conceived sometimes\r\n      in a state of composition, and sometimes of division: (2) The division or\r\n      distinction is sometimes heightened into total opposition, e.g. between\r\n      one and same, one and other: or (3) The idea, which has been already\r\n      divided, is regarded, like a number, as capable of further infinite\r\n      subdivision: (4) The argument often proceeds 'a dicto secundum quid ad\r\n      dictum simpliciter' and conversely: (5) The analogy of opposites is\r\n      misused by him; he argues indiscriminately sometimes from what is like,\r\n      sometimes from what is unlike in them: (6) The idea of being or not-being\r\n      is identified with existence or non-existence in place or time: (7) The\r\n      same ideas are regarded sometimes as in process of transition, sometimes\r\n      as alternatives or opposites: (8) There are no degrees or kinds of\r\n      sameness, likeness, difference, nor any adequate conception of motion or\r\n      change: (9) One, being, time, like space in Zeno's puzzle of Achilles and\r\n      the tortoise, are regarded sometimes as continuous and sometimes as\r\n      discrete: (10) In some parts of the argument the abstraction is so\r\n      rarefied as to become not only fallacious, but almost unintelligible, e.g.\r\n      in the contradiction which is elicited out of the relative terms older and\r\n      younger: (11) The relation between two terms is regarded under\r\n      contradictory aspects, as for example when the existence of the one and\r\n      the non-existence of the one are equally assumed to involve the existence\r\n      of the many: (12) Words are used through long chains of argument,\r\n      sometimes loosely, sometimes with the precision of numbers or of\r\n      geometrical figures.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The argument is a very curious piece of work, unique in literature. It\r\n      seems to be an exposition or rather a 'reductio ad absurdum' of the\r\n      Megarian philosophy, but we are too imperfectly acquainted with this last\r\n      to speak with confidence about it. It would be safer to say that it is an\r\n      indication of the sceptical, hyperlogical fancies which prevailed among\r\n      the contemporaries of Socrates. It throws an indistinct light upon\r\n      Aristotle, and makes us aware of the debt which the world owes to him or\r\n      his school. It also bears a resemblance to some modern speculations, in\r\n      which an attempt is made to narrow language in such a manner that number\r\n      and figure may be made a calculus of thought. It exaggerates one side of\r\n      logic and forgets the rest. It has the appearance of a mathematical\r\n      process; the inventor of it delights, as mathematicians do, in eliciting\r\n      or discovering an unexpected result. It also helps to guard us against\r\n      some fallacies by showing the consequences which flow from them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In the Parmenides we seem to breathe the spirit of the Megarian\r\n      philosophy, though we cannot compare the two in detail. But Plato also\r\n      goes beyond his Megarian contemporaries; he has split their straws over\r\n      again, and admitted more than they would have desired. He is indulging the\r\n      analytical tendencies of his age, which can divide but not combine. And he\r\n      does not stop to inquire whether the distinctions which he makes are\r\n      shadowy and fallacious, but 'whither the argument blows' he follows.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      III. The negative series of propositions contains the first conception of\r\n      the negation of a negation. Two minus signs in arithmetic or algebra make\r\n      a plus. Two negatives destroy each other. This abstruse notion is the\r\n      foundation of the Hegelian logic. The mind must not only admit that\r\n      determination is negation, but must get through negation into affirmation.\r\n      Whether this process is real, or in any way an assistance to thought, or,\r\n      like some other logical forms, a mere figure of speech transferred from\r\n      the sphere of mathematics, may be doubted. That Plato and the most subtle\r\n      philosopher of the nineteenth century should have lighted upon the same\r\n      notion, is a singular coincidence of ancient and modern thought.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      IV. The one and the many or others are reduced to their strictest\r\n      arithmetical meaning. That one is three or three one, is a proposition\r\n      which has, perhaps, given rise to more controversy in the world than any\r\n      other. But no one has ever meant to say that three and one are to be taken\r\n      in the same sense. Whereas the one and many of the Parmenides have\r\n      precisely the same meaning; there is no notion of one personality or\r\n      substance having many attributes or qualities. The truth seems to be\r\n      rather the opposite of that which Socrates implies: There is no\r\n      contradiction in the concrete, but in the abstract; and the more abstract\r\n      the idea, the more palpable will be the contradiction. For just as nothing\r\n      can persuade us that the number one is the number three, so neither can we\r\n      be persuaded that any abstract idea is identical with its opposite,\r\n      although they may both inhere together in some external object, or some\r\n      more comprehensive conception. Ideas, persons, things may be one in one\r\n      sense and many in another, and may have various degrees of unity and\r\n      plurality. But in whatever sense and in whatever degree they are one they\r\n      cease to be many; and in whatever degree or sense they are many they cease\r\n      to be one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Two points remain to be considered: 1st, the connexion between the first\r\n      and second parts of the dialogue; 2ndly, the relation of the Parmenides to\r\n      the other dialogues.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I. In both divisions of the dialogue the principal speaker is the same,\r\n      and the method pursued by him is also the same, being a criticism on\r\n      received opinions: first, on the doctrine of Ideas; secondly, of Being.\r\n      From the Platonic Ideas we naturally proceed to the Eleatic One or Being\r\n      which is the foundation of them. They are the same philosophy in two\r\n      forms, and the simpler form is the truer and deeper. For the Platonic\r\n      Ideas are mere numerical differences, and the moment we attempt to\r\n      distinguish between them, their transcendental character is lost; ideas of\r\n      justice, temperance, and good, are really distinguishable only with\r\n      reference to their application in the world. If we once ask how they are\r\n      related to individuals or to the ideas of the divine mind, they are again\r\n      merged in the aboriginal notion of Being. No one can answer the questions\r\n      which Parmenides asks of Socrates. And yet these questions are asked with\r\n      the express acknowledgment that the denial of ideas will be the\r\n      destruction of the human mind. The true answer to the difficulty here\r\n      thrown out is the establishment of a rational psychology; and this is a\r\n      work which is commenced in the Sophist. Plato, in urging the difficulty of\r\n      his own doctrine of Ideas, is far from denying that some doctrine of Ideas\r\n      is necessary, and for this he is paving the way.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In a similar spirit he criticizes the Eleatic doctrine of Being, not\r\n      intending to deny Ontology, but showing that the old Eleatic notion, and\r\n      the very name 'Being,' is unable to maintain itself against the subtleties\r\n      of the Megarians. He did not mean to say that Being or Substance had no\r\n      existence, but he is preparing for the development of his later view, that\r\n      ideas were capable of relation. The fact that contradictory consequences\r\n      follow from the existence or non-existence of one or many, does not prove\r\n      that they have or have not existence, but rather that some different mode\r\n      of conceiving them is required. Parmenides may still have thought that\r\n      'Being was,' just as Kant would have asserted the existence of 'things in\r\n      themselves,' while denying the transcendental use of the Categories.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Several lesser links also connect the first and second parts of the\r\n      dialogue: (1) The thesis is the same as that which Zeno has been already\r\n      discussing: (2) Parmenides has intimated in the first part, that the\r\n      method of Zeno should, as Socrates desired, be extended to Ideas: (3) The\r\n      difficulty of participating in greatness, smallness, equality is urged\r\n      against the Ideas as well as against the One.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      II. The Parmenides is not only a criticism of the Eleatic notion of Being,\r\n      but also of the methods of reasoning then in existence, and in this point\r\n      of view, as well as in the other, may be regarded as an introduction to\r\n      the Sophist. Long ago, in the Euthydemus, the vulgar application of the\r\n      'both and neither' Eristic had been subjected to a similar criticism,\r\n      which there takes the form of banter and irony, here of illustration.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The attack upon the Ideas is resumed in the Philebus, and is followed by a\r\n      return to a more rational philosophy. The perplexity of the One and Many\r\n      is there confined to the region of Ideas, and replaced by a theory of\r\n      classification; the Good arranged in classes is also contrasted with the\r\n      barren abstraction of the Megarians. The war is carried on against the\r\n      Eristics in all the later dialogues, sometimes with a playful irony, at\r\n      other times with a sort of contempt. But there is no lengthened refutation\r\n      of them. The Parmenides belongs to that stage of the dialogues of Plato in\r\n      which he is partially under their influence, using them as a sort of\r\n      'critics or diviners' of the truth of his own, and of the Eleatic\r\n      theories. In the Theaetetus a similar negative dialectic is employed in\r\n      the attempt to define science, which after every effort remains undefined\r\n      still. The same question is revived from the objective side in the\r\n      Sophist: Being and Not-being are no longer exhibited in opposition, but\r\n      are now reconciled; and the true nature of Not-being is discovered and\r\n      made the basis of the correlation of ideas. Some links are probably\r\n      missing which might have been supplied if we had trustworthy accounts of\r\n      Plato's oral teaching.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      To sum up: the Parmenides of Plato is a critique, first, of the Platonic\r\n      Ideas, and secondly, of the Eleatic doctrine of Being. Neither are\r\n      absolutely denied. But certain difficulties and consequences are shown in\r\n      the assumption of either, which prove that the Platonic as well as the\r\n      Eleatic doctrine must be remodelled. The negation and contradiction which\r\n      are involved in the conception of the One and Many are preliminary to\r\n      their final adjustment. The Platonic Ideas are tested by the interrogative\r\n      method of Socrates; the Eleatic One or Being is tried by the severer and\r\n      perhaps impossible method of hypothetical consequences, negative and\r\n      affirmative. In the latter we have an example of the Zenonian or Megarian\r\n      dialectic, which proceeded, not 'by assailing premises, but conclusions';\r\n      this is worked out and improved by Plato. When primary abstractions are\r\n      used in every conceivable sense, any or every conclusion may be deduced\r\n      from them. The words 'one,' 'other,' 'being,' 'like,' 'same,' 'whole,' and\r\n      their opposites, have slightly different meanings, as they are applied to\r\n      objects of thought or objects of sense\u2014to number, time, place, and\r\n      to the higher ideas of the reason;\u2014and out of their different\r\n      meanings this 'feast' of contradictions 'has been provided.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n      ...\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The Parmenides of Plato belongs to a stage of philosophy which has passed\r\n      away. At first we read it with a purely antiquarian or historical\r\n      interest; and with difficulty throw ourselves back into a state of the\r\n      human mind in which Unity and Being occupied the attention of\r\n      philosophers. We admire the precision of the language, in which, as in\r\n      some curious puzzle, each word is exactly fitted into every other, and\r\n      long trains of argument are carried out with a sort of geometrical\r\n      accuracy. We doubt whether any abstract notion could stand the searching\r\n      cross-examination of Parmenides; and may at last perhaps arrive at the\r\n      conclusion that Plato has been using an imaginary method to work out an\r\n      unmeaning conclusion. But the truth is, that he is carrying on a process\r\n      which is not either useless or unnecessary in any age of philosophy. We\r\n      fail to understand him, because we do not realize that the questions which\r\n      he is discussing could have had any value or importance. We suppose them\r\n      to be like the speculations of some of the Schoolmen, which end in\r\n      nothing. But in truth he is trying to get rid of the stumbling-blocks of\r\n      thought which beset his contemporaries. Seeing that the Megarians and\r\n      Cynics were making knowledge impossible, he takes their 'catch-words' and\r\n      analyzes them from every conceivable point of view. He is criticizing the\r\n      simplest and most general of our ideas, in which, as they are the most\r\n      comprehensive, the danger of error is the most serious; for, if they\r\n      remain unexamined, as in a mathematical demonstration, all that flows from\r\n      them is affected, and the error pervades knowledge far and wide. In the\r\n      beginning of philosophy this correction of human ideas was even more\r\n      necessary than in our own times, because they were more bound up with\r\n      words; and words when once presented to the mind exercised a greater power\r\n      over thought. There is a natural realism which says, 'Can there be a word\r\n      devoid of meaning, or an idea which is an idea of nothing?' In modern\r\n      times mankind have often given too great importance to a word or idea. The\r\n      philosophy of the ancients was still more in slavery to them, because they\r\n      had not the experience of error, which would have placed them above the\r\n      illusion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The method of the Parmenides may be compared with the process of\r\n      purgation, which Bacon sought to introduce into philosophy. Plato is\r\n      warning us against two sorts of 'Idols of the Den': first, his own Ideas,\r\n      which he himself having created is unable to connect in any way with the\r\n      external world; secondly, against two idols in particular, 'Unity' and\r\n      'Being,' which had grown up in the pre-Socratic philosophy, and were still\r\n      standing in the way of all progress and development of thought. He does\r\n      not say with Bacon, 'Let us make truth by experiment,' or 'From these\r\n      vague and inexact notions let us turn to facts.' The time has not yet\r\n      arrived for a purely inductive philosophy. The instruments of thought must\r\n      first be forged, that they may be used hereafter by modern inquirers. How,\r\n      while mankind were disputing about universals, could they classify\r\n      phenomena? How could they investigate causes, when they had not as yet\r\n      learned to distinguish between a cause and an end? How could they make any\r\n      progress in the sciences without first arranging them? These are the\r\n      deficiencies which Plato is seeking to supply in an age when knowledge was\r\n      a shadow of a name only. In the earlier dialogues the Socratic conception\r\n      of universals is illustrated by his genius; in the Phaedrus the nature of\r\n      division is explained; in the Republic the law of contradiction and the\r\n      unity of knowledge are asserted; in the later dialogues he is constantly\r\n      engaged both with the theory and practice of classification. These were\r\n      the 'new weapons,' as he terms them in the Philebus, which he was\r\n      preparing for the use of some who, in after ages, would be found ready\r\n      enough to disown their obligations to the great master, or rather,\r\n      perhaps, would be incapable of understanding them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Numberless fallacies, as we are often truly told, have originated in a\r\n      confusion of the 'copula,' and the 'verb of existence.' Would not the\r\n      distinction which Plato by the mouth of Parmenides makes between 'One is\r\n      one' and 'One has being' have saved us from this and many similar\r\n      confusions? We see again that a long period in the history of philosophy\r\n      was a barren tract, not uncultivated, but unfruitful, because there was no\r\n      inquiry into the relation of language and thought, and the metaphysical\r\n      imagination was incapable of supplying the missing link between words and\r\n      things. The famous dispute between Nominalists and Realists would never\r\n      have been heard of, if, instead of transferring the Platonic Ideas into a\r\n      crude Latin phraseology, the spirit of Plato had been truly understood and\r\n      appreciated. Upon the term substance at least two celebrated theological\r\n      controversies appear to hinge, which would not have existed, or at least\r\n      not in their present form, if we had 'interrogated' the word substance, as\r\n      Plato has the notions of Unity and Being. These weeds of philosophy have\r\n      struck their roots deep into the soil, and are always tending to reappear,\r\n      sometimes in new-fangled forms; while similar words, such as development,\r\n      evolution, law, and the like, are constantly put in the place of facts,\r\n      even by writers who profess to base truth entirely upon fact. In an\r\n      unmetaphysical age there is probably more metaphysics in the common sense\r\n      (i.e. more a priori assumption) than in any other, because there is more\r\n      complete unconsciousness that we are resting on our own ideas, while we\r\n      please ourselves with the conviction that we are resting on facts. We do\r\n      not consider how much metaphysics are required to place us above\r\n      metaphysics, or how difficult it is to prevent the forms of expression\r\n      which are ready made for our use from outrunning actual observation and\r\n      experiment.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In the last century the educated world were astonished to find that the\r\n      whole fabric of their ideas was falling to pieces, because Hume amused\r\n      himself by analyzing the word 'cause' into uniform sequence. Then arose a\r\n      philosophy which, equally regardless of the history of the mind, sought to\r\n      save mankind from scepticism by assigning to our notions of 'cause and\r\n      effect,' 'substance and accident,' 'whole and part,' a necessary place in\r\n      human thought. Without them we could have no experience, and therefore\r\n      they were supposed to be prior to experience\u2014to be incrusted on the\r\n      'I'; although in the phraseology of Kant there could be no transcendental\r\n      use of them, or, in other words, they were only applicable within the\r\n      range of our knowledge. But into the origin of these ideas, which he\r\n      obtains partly by an analysis of the proposition, partly by development of\r\n      the 'ego,' he never inquires\u2014they seem to him to have a necessary\r\n      existence; nor does he attempt to analyse the various senses in which the\r\n      word 'cause' or 'substance' may be employed.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The philosophy of Berkeley could never have had any meaning, even to\r\n      himself, if he had first analyzed from every point of view the conception\r\n      of 'matter.' This poor forgotten word (which was 'a very good word' to\r\n      describe the simplest generalization of external objects) is now\r\n      superseded in the vocabulary of physical philosophers by 'force,' which\r\n      seems to be accepted without any rigid examination of its meaning, as if\r\n      the general idea of 'force' in our minds furnished an explanation of the\r\n      infinite variety of forces which exist in the universe. A similar\r\n      ambiguity occurs in the use of the favourite word 'law,' which is\r\n      sometimes regarded as a mere abstraction, and then elevated into a real\r\n      power or entity, almost taking the place of God. Theology, again, is full\r\n      of undefined terms which have distracted the human mind for ages. Mankind\r\n      have reasoned from them, but not to them; they have drawn out the\r\n      conclusions without proving the premises; they have asserted the premises\r\n      without examining the terms. The passions of religious parties have been\r\n      roused to the utmost about words of which they could have given no\r\n      explanation, and which had really no distinct meaning. One sort of them,\r\n      faith, grace, justification, have been the symbols of one class of\r\n      disputes; as the words substance, nature, person, of another, revelation,\r\n      inspiration, and the like, of a third. All of them have been the subject\r\n      of endless reasonings and inferences; but a spell has hung over the minds\r\n      of theologians or philosophers which has prevented them from examining the\r\n      words themselves. Either the effort to rise above and beyond their own\r\n      first ideas was too great for them, or there might, perhaps, have seemed\r\n      to be an irreverence in doing so. About the Divine Being Himself, in whom\r\n      all true theological ideas live and move, men have spoken and reasoned\r\n      much, and have fancied that they instinctively know Him. But they hardly\r\n      suspect that under the name of God even Christians have included two\r\n      characters or natures as much opposed as the good and evil principle of\r\n      the Persians.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      To have the true use of words we must compare them with things; in using\r\n      them we acknowledge that they seldom give a perfect representation of our\r\n      meaning. In like manner when we interrogate our ideas we find that we are\r\n      not using them always in the sense which we supposed. And Plato, while he\r\n      criticizes the inconsistency of his own doctrine of universals and draws\r\n      out the endless consequences which flow from the assertion either that\r\n      'Being is' or that 'Being is not,' by no means intends to deny the\r\n      existence of universals or the unity under which they are comprehended.\r\n      There is nothing further from his thoughts than scepticism. But before\r\n      proceeding he must examine the foundations which he and others have been\r\n      laying; there is nothing true which is not from some point of view untrue,\r\n      nothing absolute which is not also relative (compare Republic).\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And so, in modern times, because we are called upon to analyze our ideas\r\n      and to come to a distinct understanding about the meaning of words;\r\n      because we know that the powers of language are very unequal to the\r\n      subtlety of nature or of mind, we do not therefore renounce the use of\r\n      them; but we replace them in their old connexion, having first tested\r\n      their meaning and quality, and having corrected the error which is\r\n      involved in them; or rather always remembering to make allowance for the\r\n      adulteration or alloy which they contain. We cannot call a new\r\n      metaphysical world into existence any more than we can frame a new\r\n      universal language; in thought as in speech, we are dependent on the past.\r\n      We know that the words 'cause' and 'effect' are very far from representing\r\n      to us the continuity or the complexity of nature or the different modes or\r\n      degrees in which phenomena are connected. Yet we accept them as the best\r\n      expression which we have of the correlation of forces or objects. We see\r\n      that the term 'law' is a mere abstraction, under which laws of matter and\r\n      of mind, the law of nature and the law of the land are included, and some\r\n      of these uses of the word are confusing, because they introduce into one\r\n      sphere of thought associations which belong to another; for example, order\r\n      or sequence is apt to be confounded with external compulsion and the\r\n      internal workings of the mind with their material antecedents. Yet none of\r\n      them can be dispensed with; we can only be on our guard against the error\r\n      or confusion which arises out of them. Thus in the use of the word\r\n      'substance' we are far from supposing that there is any mysterious\r\n      substratum apart from the objects which we see, and we acknowledge that\r\n      the negative notion is very likely to become a positive one. Still we\r\n      retain the word as a convenient generalization, though not without a\r\n      double sense, substance, and essence, derived from the two-fold\r\n      translation of the Greek ousia.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      So the human mind makes the reflection that God is not a person like\r\n      ourselves\u2014is not a cause like the material causes in nature, nor\r\n      even an intelligent cause like a human agent\u2014nor an individual, for\r\n      He is universal; and that every possible conception which we can form of\r\n      Him is limited by the human faculties. We cannot by any effort of thought\r\n      or exertion of faith be in and out of our own minds at the same instant.\r\n      How can we conceive Him under the forms of time and space, who is out of\r\n      time and space? How get rid of such forms and see Him as He is? How can we\r\n      imagine His relation to the world or to ourselves? Innumerable\r\n      contradictions follow from either of the two alternatives, that God is or\r\n      that He is not. Yet we are far from saying that we know nothing of Him,\r\n      because all that we know is subject to the conditions of human thought. To\r\n      the old belief in Him we return, but with corrections. He is a person, but\r\n      not like ourselves; a mind, but not a human mind; a cause, but not a\r\n      material cause, nor yet a maker or artificer. The words which we use are\r\n      imperfect expressions of His true nature; but we do not therefore lose\r\n      faith in what is best and highest in ourselves and in the world.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      'A little philosophy takes us away from God; a great deal brings us back\r\n      to Him.' When we begin to reflect, our first thoughts respecting Him and\r\n      ourselves are apt to be sceptical. For we can analyze our religious as\r\n      well as our other ideas; we can trace their history; we can criticize\r\n      their perversion; we see that they are relative to the human mind and to\r\n      one another. But when we have carried our criticism to the furthest point,\r\n      they still remain, a necessity of our moral nature, better known and\r\n      understood by us, and less liable to be shaken, because we are more aware\r\n      of their necessary imperfection. They come to us with 'better opinion,\r\n      better confirmation,' not merely as the inspirations either of ourselves\r\n      or of another, but deeply rooted in history and in the human mind.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      PARMENIDES\r\n    \r\n\r\n      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Cephalus, Adeimantus, Glaucon, Antiphon,\r\n      Pythodorus, Socrates, Zeno, Parmenides, Aristoteles.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Cephalus rehearses a dialogue which is supposed to have been narrated in\r\n      his presence by Antiphon, the half-brother of Adeimantus and Glaucon, to\r\n      certain Clazomenians.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      We had come from our home at Clazomenae to Athens, and met Adeimantus and\r\n      Glaucon in the Agora. Welcome, Cephalus, said Adeimantus, taking me by the\r\n      hand; is there anything which we can do for you in Athens?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes; that is why I am here; I wish to ask a favour of you.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What may that be? he said.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I want you to tell me the name of your half brother, which I have\r\n      forgotten; he was a mere child when I last came hither from Clazomenae,\r\n      but that was a long time ago; his father's name, if I remember rightly,\r\n      was Pyrilampes?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, he said, and the name of our brother, Antiphon; but why do you ask?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let me introduce some countrymen of mine, I said; they are lovers of\r\n      philosophy, and have heard that Antiphon was intimate with a certain\r\n      Pythodorus, a friend of Zeno, and remembers a conversation which took\r\n      place between Socrates, Zeno, and Parmenides many years ago, Pythodorus\r\n      having often recited it to him.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And could we hear it? I asked.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nothing easier, he replied; when he was a youth he made a careful study of\r\n      the piece; at present his thoughts run in another direction; like his\r\n      grandfather Antiphon he is devoted to horses. But, if that is what you\r\n      want, let us go and look for him; he dwells at Melita, which is quite\r\n      near, and he has only just left us to go home.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Accordingly we went to look for him; he was at home, and in the act of\r\n      giving a bridle to a smith to be fitted. When he had done with the smith,\r\n      his brothers told him the purpose of our visit; and he saluted me as an\r\n      acquaintance whom he remembered from my former visit, and we asked him to\r\n      repeat the dialogue. At first he was not very willing, and complained of\r\n      the trouble, but at length he consented. He told us that Pythodorus had\r\n      described to him the appearance of Parmenides and Zeno; they came to\r\n      Athens, as he said, at the great Panathenaea; the former was, at the time\r\n      of his visit, about 65 years old, very white with age, but well favoured.\r\n      Zeno was nearly 40 years of age, tall and fair to look upon; in the days\r\n      of his youth he was reported to have been beloved by Parmenides. He said\r\n      that they lodged with Pythodorus in the Ceramicus, outside the wall,\r\n      whither Socrates, then a very young man, came to see them, and many others\r\n      with him; they wanted to hear the writings of Zeno, which had been brought\r\n      to Athens for the first time on the occasion of their visit. These Zeno\r\n      himself read to them in the absence of Parmenides, and had very nearly\r\n      finished when Pythodorus entered, and with him Parmenides and Aristoteles\r\n      who was afterwards one of the Thirty, and heard the little that remained\r\n      of the dialogue. Pythodorus had heard Zeno repeat them before.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      When the recitation was completed, Socrates requested that the first\r\n      thesis of the first argument might be read over again, and this having\r\n      been done, he said: What is your meaning, Zeno? Do you maintain that if\r\n      being is many, it must be both like and unlike, and that this is\r\n      impossible, for neither can the like be unlike, nor the unlike like\u2014is\r\n      that your position?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Just so, said Zeno.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if the unlike cannot be like, or the like unlike, then according to\r\n      you, being could not be many; for this would involve an impossibility. In\r\n      all that you say have you any other purpose except to disprove the being\r\n      of the many? and is not each division of your treatise intended to furnish\r\n      a separate proof of this, there being in all as many proofs of the\r\n      not-being of the many as you have composed arguments? Is that your\r\n      meaning, or have I misunderstood you?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No, said Zeno; you have correctly understood my general purpose.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I see, Parmenides, said Socrates, that Zeno would like to be not only one\r\n      with you in friendship but your second self in his writings too; he puts\r\n      what you say in another way, and would fain make believe that he is\r\n      telling us something which is new. For you, in your poems, say The All is\r\n      one, and of this you adduce excellent proofs; and he on the other hand\r\n      says There is no many; and on behalf of this he offers overwhelming\r\n      evidence. You affirm unity, he denies plurality. And so you deceive the\r\n      world into believing that you are saying different things when really you\r\n      are saying much the same. This is a strain of art beyond the reach of most\r\n      of us.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, Socrates, said Zeno. But although you are as keen as a Spartan hound\r\n      in pursuing the track, you do not fully apprehend the true motive of the\r\n      composition, which is not really such an artificial work as you imagine;\r\n      for what you speak of was an accident; there was no pretence of a great\r\n      purpose; nor any serious intention of deceiving the world. The truth is,\r\n      that these writings of mine were meant to protect the arguments of\r\n      Parmenides against those who make fun of him and seek to show the many\r\n      ridiculous and contradictory results which they suppose to follow from the\r\n      affirmation of the one. My answer is addressed to the partisans of the\r\n      many, whose attack I return with interest by retorting upon them that\r\n      their hypothesis of the being of many, if carried out, appears to be still\r\n      more ridiculous than the hypothesis of the being of one. Zeal for my\r\n      master led me to write the book in the days of my youth, but some one\r\n      stole the copy; and therefore I had no choice whether it should be\r\n      published or not; the motive, however, of writing, was not the ambition of\r\n      an elder man, but the pugnacity of a young one. This you do not seem to\r\n      see, Socrates; though in other respects, as I was saying, your notion is a\r\n      very just one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I understand, said Socrates, and quite accept your account. But tell me,\r\n      Zeno, do you not further think that there is an idea of likeness in\r\n      itself, and another idea of unlikeness, which is the opposite of likeness,\r\n      and that in these two, you and I and all other things to which we apply\r\n      the term many, participate\u2014things which participate in likeness\r\n      become in that degree and manner like; and so far as they participate in\r\n      unlikeness become in that degree unlike, or both like and unlike in the\r\n      degree in which they participate in both? And may not all things partake\r\n      of both opposites, and be both like and unlike, by reason of this\r\n      participation?\u2014Where is the wonder? Now if a person could prove the\r\n      absolute like to become unlike, or the absolute unlike to become like,\r\n      that, in my opinion, would indeed be a wonder; but there is nothing\r\n      extraordinary, Zeno, in showing that the things which only partake of\r\n      likeness and unlikeness experience both. Nor, again, if a person were to\r\n      show that all is one by partaking of one, and at the same time many by\r\n      partaking of many, would that be very astonishing. But if he were to show\r\n      me that the absolute one was many, or the absolute many one, I should be\r\n      truly amazed. And so of all the rest: I should be surprised to hear that\r\n      the natures or ideas themselves had these opposite qualities; but not if a\r\n      person wanted to prove of me that I was many and also one. When he wanted\r\n      to show that I was many he would say that I have a right and a left side,\r\n      and a front and a back, and an upper and a lower half, for I cannot deny\r\n      that I partake of multitude; when, on the other hand, he wants to prove\r\n      that I am one, he will say, that we who are here assembled are seven, and\r\n      that I am one and partake of the one. In both instances he proves his\r\n      case. So again, if a person shows that such things as wood, stones, and\r\n      the like, being many are also one, we admit that he shows the coexistence\r\n      of the one and many, but he does not show that the many are one or the one\r\n      many; he is uttering not a paradox but a truism. If however, as I just now\r\n      suggested, some one were to abstract simple notions of like, unlike, one,\r\n      many, rest, motion, and similar ideas, and then to show that these admit\r\n      of admixture and separation in themselves, I should be very much\r\n      astonished. This part of the argument appears to be treated by you, Zeno,\r\n      in a very spirited manner; but, as I was saying, I should be far more\r\n      amazed if any one found in the ideas themselves which are apprehended by\r\n      reason, the same puzzle and entanglement which you have shown to exist in\r\n      visible objects.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      While Socrates was speaking, Pythodorus thought that Parmenides and Zeno\r\n      were not altogether pleased at the successive steps of the argument; but\r\n      still they gave the closest attention, and often looked at one another,\r\n      and smiled as if in admiration of him. When he had finished, Parmenides\r\n      expressed their feelings in the following words:\u2014\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Socrates, he said, I admire the bent of your mind towards philosophy; tell\r\n      me now, was this your own distinction between ideas in themselves and the\r\n      things which partake of them? and do you think that there is an idea of\r\n      likeness apart from the likeness which we possess, and of the one and\r\n      many, and of the other things which Zeno mentioned?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I think that there are such ideas, said Socrates.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Parmenides proceeded: And would you also make absolute ideas of the just\r\n      and the beautiful and the good, and of all that class?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, he said, I should.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And would you make an idea of man apart from us and from all other human\r\n      creatures, or of fire and water?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I am often undecided, Parmenides, as to whether I ought to include them or\r\n      not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And would you feel equally undecided, Socrates, about things of which the\r\n      mention may provoke a smile?\u2014I mean such things as hair, mud, dirt,\r\n      or anything else which is vile and paltry; would you suppose that each of\r\n      these has an idea distinct from the actual objects with which we come into\r\n      contact, or not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not, said Socrates; visible things like these are such as they\r\n      appear to us, and I am afraid that there would be an absurdity in assuming\r\n      any idea of them, although I sometimes get disturbed, and begin to think\r\n      that there is nothing without an idea; but then again, when I have taken\r\n      up this position, I run away, because I am afraid that I may fall into a\r\n      bottomless pit of nonsense, and perish; and so I return to the ideas of\r\n      which I was just now speaking, and occupy myself with them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, Socrates, said Parmenides; that is because you are still young; the\r\n      time will come, if I am not mistaken, when philosophy will have a firmer\r\n      grasp of you, and then you will not despise even the meanest things; at\r\n      your age, you are too much disposed to regard the opinions of men. But I\r\n      should like to know whether you mean that there are certain ideas of which\r\n      all other things partake, and from which they derive their names; that\r\n      similars, for example, become similar, because they partake of similarity;\r\n      and great things become great, because they partake of greatness; and that\r\n      just and beautiful things become just and beautiful, because they partake\r\n      of justice and beauty?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, certainly, said Socrates that is my meaning.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then each individual partakes either of the whole of the idea or else of a\r\n      part of the idea? Can there be any other mode of participation?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There cannot be, he said.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then do you think that the whole idea is one, and yet, being one, is in\r\n      each one of the many?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not, Parmenides? said Socrates.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because one and the same thing will exist as a whole at the same time in\r\n      many separate individuals, and will therefore be in a state of separation\r\n      from itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many\r\n      places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may\r\n      be one and the same in all at the same time.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I like your way, Socrates, of making one in many places at once. You mean\r\n      to say, that if I were to spread out a sail and cover a number of men,\r\n      there would be one whole including many\u2014is not that your meaning?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I think so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And would you say that the whole sail includes each man, or a part of it\r\n      only, and different parts different men?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The latter.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, Socrates, the ideas themselves will be divisible, and things which\r\n      participate in them will have a part of them only and not the whole idea\r\n      existing in each of them?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That seems to follow.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then would you like to say, Socrates, that the one idea is really\r\n      divisible and yet remains one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not, he said.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Suppose that you divide absolute greatness, and that of the many great\r\n      things, each one is great in virtue of a portion of greatness less than\r\n      absolute greatness\u2014is that conceivable?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Or will each equal thing, if possessing some small portion of equality\r\n      less than absolute equality, be equal to some other thing by virtue of\r\n      that portion only?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Or suppose one of us to have a portion of smallness; this is but a part of\r\n      the small, and therefore the absolutely small is greater; if the\r\n      absolutely small be greater, that to which the part of the small is added\r\n      will be smaller and not greater than before.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How absurd!\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then in what way, Socrates, will all things participate in the ideas, if\r\n      they are unable to participate in them either as parts or wholes?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Indeed, he said, you have asked a question which is not easily answered.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Well, said Parmenides, and what do you say of another question?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What question?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I imagine that the way in which you are led to assume one idea of each\r\n      kind is as follows:\u2014You see a number of great objects, and when you\r\n      look at them there seems to you to be one and the same idea (or nature) in\r\n      them all; hence you conceive of greatness as one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true, said Socrates.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if you go on and allow your mind in like manner to embrace in one view\r\n      the idea of greatness and of great things which are not the idea, and to\r\n      compare them, will not another greatness arise, which will appear to be\r\n      the source of all these?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would seem so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then another idea of greatness now comes into view over and above absolute\r\n      greatness, and the individuals which partake of it; and then another, over\r\n      and above all these, by virtue of which they will all be great, and so\r\n      each idea instead of being one will be infinitely multiplied.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But may not the ideas, asked Socrates, be thoughts only, and have no\r\n      proper existence except in our minds, Parmenides? For in that case each\r\n      idea may still be one, and not experience this infinite multiplication.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And can there be individual thoughts which are thoughts of nothing?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible, he said.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The thought must be of something?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of something which is or which is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of something which is.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Must it not be of a single something, which the thought recognizes as\r\n      attaching to all, being a single form or nature?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And will not the something which is apprehended as one and the same in\r\n      all, be an idea?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      From that, again, there is no escape.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, said Parmenides, if you say that everything else participates in the\r\n      ideas, must you not say either that everything is made up of thoughts, and\r\n      that all things think; or that they are thoughts but have no thought?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The latter view, Parmenides, is no more rational than the previous one. In\r\n      my opinion, the ideas are, as it were, patterns fixed in nature, and other\r\n      things are like them, and resemblances of them\u2014what is meant by the\r\n      participation of other things in the ideas, is really assimilation to\r\n      them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if, said he, the individual is like the idea, must not the idea also\r\n      be like the individual, in so far as the individual is a resemblance of\r\n      the idea? That which is like, cannot be conceived of as other than the\r\n      like of like.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And when two things are alike, must they not partake of the same idea?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They must.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And will not that of which the two partake, and which makes them alike, be\r\n      the idea itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the idea cannot be like the individual, or the individual like the\r\n      idea; for if they are alike, some further idea of likeness will always be\r\n      coming to light, and if that be like anything else, another; and new ideas\r\n      will be always arising, if the idea resembles that which partakes of it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The theory, then, that other things participate in the ideas by\r\n      resemblance, has to be given up, and some other mode of participation\r\n      devised?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would seem so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Do you see then, Socrates, how great is the difficulty of affirming the\r\n      ideas to be absolute?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, indeed.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And, further, let me say that as yet you only understand a small part of\r\n      the difficulty which is involved if you make of each thing a single idea,\r\n      parting it off from other things.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What difficulty? he said.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There are many, but the greatest of all is this:\u2014If an opponent\r\n      argues that these ideas, being such as we say they ought to be, must\r\n      remain unknown, no one can prove to him that he is wrong, unless he who\r\n      denies their existence be a man of great ability and knowledge, and is\r\n      willing to follow a long and laborious demonstration; he will remain\r\n      unconvinced, and still insist that they cannot be known.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What do you mean, Parmenides? said Socrates.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In the first place, I think, Socrates, that you, or any one who maintains\r\n      the existence of absolute essences, will admit that they cannot exist in\r\n      us.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No, said Socrates; for then they would be no longer absolute.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True, he said; and therefore when ideas are what they are in relation to\r\n      one another, their essence is determined by a relation among themselves,\r\n      and has nothing to do with the resemblances, or whatever they are to be\r\n      termed, which are in our sphere, and from which we receive this or that\r\n      name when we partake of them. And the things which are within our sphere\r\n      and have the same names with them, are likewise only relative to one\r\n      another, and not to the ideas which have the same names with them, but\r\n      belong to themselves and not to them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What do you mean? said Socrates.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I may illustrate my meaning in this way, said Parmenides:\u2014A master\r\n      has a slave; now there is nothing absolute in the relation between them,\r\n      which is simply a relation of one man to another. But there is also an\r\n      idea of mastership in the abstract, which is relative to the idea of\r\n      slavery in the abstract. These natures have nothing to do with us, nor we\r\n      with them; they are concerned with themselves only, and we with ourselves.\r\n      Do you see my meaning?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, said Socrates, I quite see your meaning.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And will not knowledge\u2014I mean absolute knowledge\u2014answer to\r\n      absolute truth?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And each kind of absolute knowledge will answer to each kind of absolute\r\n      being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But the knowledge which we have, will answer to the truth which we have;\r\n      and again, each kind of knowledge which we have, will be a knowledge of\r\n      each kind of being which we have?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But the ideas themselves, as you admit, we have not, and cannot have?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No, we cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the absolute natures or kinds are known severally by the absolute idea\r\n      of knowledge?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And we have not got the idea of knowledge?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then none of the ideas are known to us, because we have no share in\r\n      absolute knowledge?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I suppose not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the nature of the beautiful in itself, and of the good in itself, and\r\n      all other ideas which we suppose to exist absolutely, are unknown to us?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would seem so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I think that there is a stranger consequence still.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What is it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Would you, or would you not say, that absolute knowledge, if there is such\r\n      a thing, must be a far more exact knowledge than our knowledge; and the\r\n      same of beauty and of the rest?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if there be such a thing as participation in absolute knowledge, no\r\n      one is more likely than God to have this most exact knowledge?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But then, will God, having absolute knowledge, have a knowledge of human\r\n      things?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because, Socrates, said Parmenides, we have admitted that the ideas are\r\n      not valid in relation to human things; nor human things in relation to\r\n      them; the relations of either are limited to their respective spheres.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, that has been admitted.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if God has this perfect authority, and perfect knowledge, his\r\n      authority cannot rule us, nor his knowledge know us, or any human thing;\r\n      just as our authority does not extend to the gods, nor our knowledge know\r\n      anything which is divine, so by parity of reason they, being gods, are not\r\n      our masters, neither do they know the things of men.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yet, surely, said Socrates, to deprive God of knowledge is monstrous.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      These, Socrates, said Parmenides, are a few, and only a few of the\r\n      difficulties in which we are involved if ideas really are and we determine\r\n      each one of them to be an absolute unity. He who hears what may be said\r\n      against them will deny the very existence of them\u2014and even if they\r\n      do exist, he will say that they must of necessity be unknown to man; and\r\n      he will seem to have reason on his side, and as we were remarking just\r\n      now, will be very difficult to convince; a man must be gifted with very\r\n      considerable ability before he can learn that everything has a class and\r\n      an absolute essence; and still more remarkable will he be who discovers\r\n      all these things for himself, and having thoroughly investigated them is\r\n      able to teach them to others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I agree with you, Parmenides, said Socrates; and what you say is very much\r\n      to my mind.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And yet, Socrates, said Parmenides, if a man, fixing his attention on\r\n      these and the like difficulties, does away with ideas of things and will\r\n      not admit that every individual thing has its own determinate idea which\r\n      is always one and the same, he will have nothing on which his mind can\r\n      rest; and so he will utterly destroy the power of reasoning, as you seem\r\n      to me to have particularly noted.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true, he said.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But, then, what is to become of philosophy? Whither shall we turn, if the\r\n      ideas are unknown?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I certainly do not see my way at present.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, said Parmenides; and I think that this arises, Socrates, out of your\r\n      attempting to define the beautiful, the just, the good, and the ideas\r\n      generally, without sufficient previous training. I noticed your\r\n      deficiency, when I heard you talking here with your friend Aristoteles,\r\n      the day before yesterday. The impulse that carries you towards philosophy\r\n      is assuredly noble and divine; but there is an art which is called by the\r\n      vulgar idle talking, and which is often imagined to be useless; in that\r\n      you must train and exercise yourself, now that you are young, or truth\r\n      will elude your grasp.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And what is the nature of this exercise, Parmenides, which you would\r\n      recommend?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That which you heard Zeno practising; at the same time, I give you credit\r\n      for saying to him that you did not care to examine the perplexity in\r\n      reference to visible things, or to consider the question that way; but\r\n      only in reference to objects of thought, and to what may be called ideas.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why, yes, he said, there appears to me to be no difficulty in showing by\r\n      this method that visible things are like and unlike and may experience\r\n      anything.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite true, said Parmenides; but I think that you should go a step\r\n      further, and consider not only the consequences which flow from a given\r\n      hypothesis, but also the consequences which flow from denying the\r\n      hypothesis; and that will be still better training for you.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What do you mean? he said.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I mean, for example, that in the case of this very hypothesis of Zeno's\r\n      about the many, you should inquire not only what will be the consequences\r\n      to the many in relation to themselves and to the one, and to the one in\r\n      relation to itself and the many, on the hypothesis of the being of the\r\n      many, but also what will be the consequences to the one and the many in\r\n      their relation to themselves and to each other, on the opposite\r\n      hypothesis. Or, again, if likeness is or is not, what will be the\r\n      consequences in either of these cases to the subjects of the hypothesis,\r\n      and to other things, in relation both to themselves and to one another,\r\n      and so of unlikeness; and the same holds good of motion and rest, of\r\n      generation and destruction, and even of being and not-being. In a word,\r\n      when you suppose anything to be or not to be, or to be in any way\r\n      affected, you must look at the consequences in relation to the thing\r\n      itself, and to any other things which you choose,\u2014to each of them\r\n      singly, to more than one, and to all; and so of other things, you must\r\n      look at them in relation to themselves and to anything else which you\r\n      suppose either to be or not to be, if you would train yourself perfectly\r\n      and see the real truth.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That, Parmenides, is a tremendous business of which you speak, and I do\r\n      not quite understand you; will you take some hypothesis and go through the\r\n      steps?\u2014then I shall apprehend you better.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That, Socrates, is a serious task to impose on a man of my years.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then will you, Zeno? said Socrates.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Zeno answered with a smile:\u2014Let us make our petition to Parmenides\r\n      himself, who is quite right in saying that you are hardly aware of the\r\n      extent of the task which you are imposing on him; and if there were more\r\n      of us I should not ask him, for these are not subjects which any one,\r\n      especially at his age, can well speak of before a large audience; most\r\n      people are not aware that this roundabout progress through all things is\r\n      the only way in which the mind can attain truth and wisdom. And therefore,\r\n      Parmenides, I join in the request of Socrates, that I may hear the process\r\n      again which I have not heard for a long time.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      When Zeno had thus spoken, Pythodorus, according to Antiphon's report of\r\n      him, said, that he himself and Aristoteles and the whole company entreated\r\n      Parmenides to give an example of the process. I cannot refuse, said\r\n      Parmenides; and yet I feel rather like Ibycus, who, when in his old age,\r\n      against his will, he fell in love, compared himself to an old racehorse,\r\n      who was about to run in a chariot race, shaking with fear at the course he\r\n      knew so well\u2014this was his simile of himself. And I also experience a\r\n      trembling when I remember through what an ocean of words I have to wade at\r\n      my time of life. But I must indulge you, as Zeno says that I ought, and we\r\n      are alone. Where shall I begin? And what shall be our first hypothesis, if\r\n      I am to attempt this laborious pastime? Shall I begin with myself, and\r\n      take my own hypothesis the one? and consider the consequences which follow\r\n      on the supposition either of the being or of the not-being of one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      By all means, said Zeno.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And who will answer me? he said. Shall I propose the youngest? He will not\r\n      make difficulties and will be the most likely to say what he thinks; and\r\n      his answers will give me time to breathe.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I am the one whom you mean, Parmenides, said Aristoteles; for I am the\r\n      youngest and at your service. Ask, and I will answer.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Parmenides proceeded: 1.a. If one is, he said, the one cannot be many?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one cannot have parts, and cannot be a whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because every part is part of a whole; is it not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And what is a whole? would not that of which no part is wanting be a\r\n      whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, in either case, the one would be made up of parts; both as being a\r\n      whole, and also as having parts?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      To be sure.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And in either case, the one would be many, and not one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But, surely, it ought to be one and not many?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It ought.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, if the one is to remain one, it will not be a whole, and will not\r\n      have parts?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if it has no parts, it will have neither beginning, middle, nor end;\r\n      for these would of course be parts of it.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Right.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But then, again, a beginning and an end are the limits of everything?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, having neither beginning nor end, is unlimited?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, unlimited.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And therefore formless; for it cannot partake either of round or straight.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But why?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why, because the round is that of which all the extreme points are\r\n      equidistant from the centre?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the straight is that of which the centre intercepts the view of the\r\n      extremes?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one would have parts and would be many, if it partook either of a\r\n      straight or of a circular form?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Assuredly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But having no parts, it will be neither straight nor round?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Right.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And, being of such a nature, it cannot be in any place, for it cannot be\r\n      either in another or in itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How so?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because if it were in another, it would be encircled by that in which it\r\n      was, and would touch it at many places and with many parts; but that which\r\n      is one and indivisible, and does not partake of a circular nature, cannot\r\n      be touched all round in many places.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if, on the other hand, one were in itself, it would also be contained\r\n      by nothing else but itself; that is to say, if it were really in itself;\r\n      for nothing can be in anything which does not contain it.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But then, that which contains must be other than that which is contained?\r\n      for the same whole cannot do and suffer both at once; and if so, one will\r\n      be no longer one, but two?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then one cannot be anywhere, either in itself or in another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Further consider, whether that which is of such a nature can have either\r\n      rest or motion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why, because the one, if it were moved, would be either moved in place or\r\n      changed in nature; for these are the only kinds of motion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one, when it changes and ceases to be itself, cannot be any longer\r\n      one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot therefore experience the sort of motion which is change of\r\n      nature?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then can the motion of the one be in place?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Perhaps.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if the one moved in place, must it not either move round and round in\r\n      the same place, or from one place to another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It must.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which moves in a circle must rest upon a centre; and that which\r\n      goes round upon a centre must have parts which are different from the\r\n      centre; but that which has no centre and no parts cannot possibly be\r\n      carried round upon a centre?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But perhaps the motion of the one consists in change of place?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Perhaps so, if it moves at all.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And have we not already shown that it cannot be in anything?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then its coming into being in anything is still more impossible; is it\r\n      not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I do not see why.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why, because anything which comes into being in anything, can neither as\r\n      yet be in that other thing while still coming into being, nor be\r\n      altogether out of it, if already coming into being in it.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And therefore whatever comes into being in another must have parts, and\r\n      then one part may be in, and another part out of that other; but that\r\n      which has no parts can never be at one and the same time neither wholly\r\n      within nor wholly without anything.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And is there not a still greater impossibility in that which has no parts,\r\n      and is not a whole, coming into being anywhere, since it cannot come into\r\n      being either as a part or as a whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it does not change place by revolving in the same spot, nor by going\r\n      somewhere and coming into being in something; nor again, by change in\r\n      itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then in respect of any kind of motion the one is immoveable?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Immoveable.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But neither can the one be in anything, as we affirm?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, we said so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it is never in the same?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because if it were in the same it would be in something.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And we said that it could not be in itself, and could not be in other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then one is never in the same place?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would seem not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But that which is never in the same place is never quiet or at rest?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Never.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      One then, as would seem, is neither at rest nor in motion?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It certainly appears so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Neither will it be the same with itself or other; nor again, other than\r\n      itself or other.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How is that?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If other than itself it would be other than one, and would not be one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if the same with other, it would be that other, and not itself; so\r\n      that upon this supposition too, it would not have the nature of one, but\r\n      would be other than one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it will not be the same with other, or other than itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It will not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Neither will it be other than other, while it remains one; for not one,\r\n      but only other, can be other than other, and nothing else.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then not by virtue of being one will it be other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if not by virtue of being one, not by virtue of itself; and if not by\r\n      virtue of itself, not itself, and itself not being other at all, will not\r\n      be other than anything?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Right.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Neither will one be the same with itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Surely the nature of the one is not the nature of the same.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It is not when anything becomes the same with anything that it becomes\r\n      one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What of that?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Anything which becomes the same with the many, necessarily becomes many\r\n      and not one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But, if there were no difference between the one and the same, when a\r\n      thing became the same, it would always become one; and when it became one,\r\n      the same?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And, therefore, if one be the same with itself, it is not one with itself,\r\n      and will therefore be one and also not one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Surely that is impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And therefore the one can neither be other than other, nor the same with\r\n      itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And thus the one can neither be the same, nor other, either in relation to\r\n      itself or other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Neither will the one be like anything or unlike itself or other.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because likeness is sameness of affections.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And sameness has been shown to be of a nature distinct from oneness?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That has been shown.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if the one had any other affection than that of being one, it would be\r\n      affected in such a way as to be more than one; which is impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one can never be so affected as to be the same either with\r\n      another or with itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it cannot be like another, or like itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor can it be affected so as to be other, for then it would be affected in\r\n      such a way as to be more than one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That which is affected otherwise than itself or another, will be unlike\r\n      itself or another, for sameness of affections is likeness.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But the one, as appears, never being affected otherwise, is never unlike\r\n      itself or other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Never.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one will never be either like or unlike itself or other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Plainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Again, being of this nature, it can neither be equal nor unequal either to\r\n      itself or to other.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How is that?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why, because the one if equal must be of the same measures as that to\r\n      which it is equal.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if greater or less than things which are commensurable with it, the\r\n      one will have more measures than that which is less, and fewer than that\r\n      which is greater?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And so of things which are not commensurate with it, the one will have\r\n      greater measures than that which is less and smaller than that which is\r\n      greater.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But how can that which does not partake of sameness, have either the same\r\n      measures or have anything else the same?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And not having the same measures, the one cannot be equal either with\r\n      itself or with another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It appears so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But again, whether it have fewer or more measures, it will have as many\r\n      parts as it has measures; and thus again the one will be no longer one but\r\n      will have as many parts as measures.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Right.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if it were of one measure, it would be equal to that measure; yet it\r\n      has been shown to be incapable of equality.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It has.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it will neither partake of one measure, nor of many, nor of few, nor\r\n      of the same at all, nor be equal to itself or another; nor be greater or\r\n      less than itself, or other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Well, and do we suppose that one can be older, or younger than anything,\r\n      or of the same age with it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why, because that which is of the same age with itself or other, must\r\n      partake of equality or likeness of time; and we said that the one did not\r\n      partake either of equality or of likeness?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      We did say so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And we also said, that it did not partake of inequality or unlikeness.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How then can one, being of this nature, be either older or younger than\r\n      anything, or have the same age with it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In no way.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then one cannot be older or younger, or of the same age, either with\r\n      itself or with another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, being of this nature, cannot be in time at all; for must not\r\n      that which is in time, be always growing older than itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which is older, must always be older than something which is\r\n      younger?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, that which becomes older than itself, also becomes at the same time\r\n      younger than itself, if it is to have something to become older than.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What do you mean?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I mean this:\u2014A thing does not need to become different from another\r\n      thing which is already different; it IS different, and if its different\r\n      has become, it has become different; if its different will be, it will be\r\n      different; but of that which is becoming different, there cannot have\r\n      been, or be about to be, or yet be, a different\u2014the only different\r\n      possible is one which is becoming.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is inevitable.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But, surely, the elder is a difference relative to the younger, and to\r\n      nothing else.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then that which becomes older than itself must also, at the same time,\r\n      become younger than itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But again, it is true that it cannot become for a longer or for a shorter\r\n      time than itself, but it must become, and be, and have become, and be\r\n      about to be, for the same time with itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That again is inevitable.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then things which are in time, and partake of time, must in every case, I\r\n      suppose, be of the same age with themselves; and must also become at once\r\n      older and younger than themselves?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But the one did not partake of those affections?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Not at all.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it does not partake of time, and is not in any time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      So the argument shows.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Well, but do not the expressions 'was,' and 'has become,' and 'was\r\n      becoming,' signify a participation of past time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And do not 'will be,' 'will become,' 'will have become,' signify a\r\n      participation of future time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And 'is,' or 'becomes,' signifies a participation of present time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if the one is absolutely without participation in time, it never had\r\n      become, or was becoming, or was at any time, or is now become or is\r\n      becoming, or is, or will become, or will have become, or will be,\r\n      hereafter.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Most true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But are there any modes of partaking of being other than these?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There are none.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one cannot possibly partake of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is the inference.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one is not at all?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one does not exist in such way as to be one; for if it were and\r\n      partook of being, it would already be; but if the argument is to be\r\n      trusted, the one neither is nor is one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But that which is not admits of no attribute or relation?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then there is no name, nor expression, nor perception, nor opinion, nor\r\n      knowledge of it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it is neither named, nor expressed, nor opined, nor known, nor does\r\n      anything that is perceive it.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      So we must infer.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But can all this be true about the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I think not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      1.b. Suppose, now, that we return once more to the original hypothesis;\r\n      let us see whether, on a further review, any new aspect of the question\r\n      appears.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I shall be very happy to do so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      We say that we have to work out together all the consequences, whatever\r\n      they may be, which follow, if the one is?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then we will begin at the beginning:\u2014If one is, can one be, and not\r\n      partake of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one will have being, but its being will not be the same with the\r\n      one; for if the same, it would not be the being of the one; nor would the\r\n      one have participated in being, for the proposition that one is would have\r\n      been identical with the proposition that one is one; but our hypothesis is\r\n      not if one is one, what will follow, but if one is:\u2014am I not right?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite right.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      We mean to say, that being has not the same significance as one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And when we put them together shortly, and say 'One is,' that is\r\n      equivalent to saying, 'partakes of being'?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Once more then let us ask, if one is what will follow. Does not this\r\n      hypothesis necessarily imply that one is of such a nature as to have\r\n      parts?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How so?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In this way:\u2014If being is predicated of the one, if the one is, and\r\n      one of being, if being is one; and if being and one are not the same; and\r\n      since the one, which we have assumed, is, must not the whole, if it is\r\n      one, itself be, and have for its parts, one and being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And is each of these parts\u2014one and being\u2014to be simply called a\r\n      part, or must the word 'part' be relative to the word 'whole'?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The latter.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then that which is one is both a whole and has a part?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Again, of the parts of the one, if it is\u2014I mean being and one\u2014does\r\n      either fail to imply the other? is the one wanting to being, or being to\r\n      the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Thus, each of the parts also has in turn both one and being, and is at the\r\n      least made up of two parts; and the same principle goes on for ever, and\r\n      every part whatever has always these two parts; for being always involves\r\n      one, and one being; so that one is always disappearing, and becoming two.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And so the one, if it is, must be infinite in multiplicity?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us take another direction.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What direction?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      We say that the one partakes of being and therefore it is?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And in this way, the one, if it has being, has turned out to be many?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But now, let us abstract the one which, as we say, partakes of being, and\r\n      try to imagine it apart from that of which, as we say, it partakes\u2014will\r\n      this abstract one be one only or many?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      One, I think.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us see:\u2014Must not the being of one be other than one? for the one\r\n      is not being, but, considered as one, only partook of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If being and the one be two different things, it is not because the one is\r\n      one that it is other than being; nor because being is being that it is\r\n      other than the one; but they differ from one another in virtue of\r\n      otherness and difference.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      So that the other is not the same\u2014either with the one or with being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And therefore whether we take being and the other, or being and the one,\r\n      or the one and the other, in every such case we take two things, which may\r\n      be rightly called both.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In this way\u2014you may speak of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And also of one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then now we have spoken of either of them?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Well, and when I speak of being and one, I speak of them both?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if I speak of being and the other, or of the one and the other,\u2014in\r\n      any such case do I not speak of both?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And must not that which is correctly called both, be also two?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Undoubtedly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And of two things how can either by any possibility not be one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, if the individuals of the pair are together two, they must be\r\n      severally one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if each of them is one, then by the addition of any one to any pair,\r\n      the whole becomes three?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And three are odd, and two are even?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if there are two there must also be twice, and if there are three\r\n      there must be thrice; that is, if twice one makes two, and thrice one\r\n      three?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There are two, and twice, and therefore there must be twice two; and there\r\n      are three, and there is thrice, and therefore there must be thrice three?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If there are three and twice, there is twice three; and if there are two\r\n      and thrice, there is thrice two?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Undoubtedly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Here, then, we have even taken even times, and odd taken odd times, and\r\n      even taken odd times, and odd taken even times.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if this is so, does any number remain which has no necessity to be?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      None whatever.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then if one is, number must also be?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It must.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if there is number, there must also be many, and infinite multiplicity\r\n      of being; for number is infinite in multiplicity, and partakes also of\r\n      being: am I not right?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if all number participates in being, every part of number will also\r\n      participate?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then being is distributed over the whole multitude of things, and nothing\r\n      that is, however small or however great, is devoid of it? And, indeed, the\r\n      very supposition of this is absurd, for how can that which is, be devoid\r\n      of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In no way.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And it is divided into the greatest and into the smallest, and into being\r\n      of all sizes, and is broken up more than all things; the divisions of it\r\n      have no limit.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it has the greatest number of parts?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, the greatest number.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Is there any of these which is a part of being, and yet no part?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if it is at all and so long as it is, it must be one, and cannot be\r\n      none?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one attaches to every single part of being, and does not fail in\r\n      any part, whether great or small, or whatever may be the size of it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But reflect:\u2014Can one, in its entirety, be in many places at the same\r\n      time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No; I see the impossibility of that.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if not in its entirety, then it is divided; for it cannot be present\r\n      with all the parts of being, unless divided.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which has parts will be as many as the parts are?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then we were wrong in saying just now, that being was distributed into the\r\n      greatest number of parts. For it is not distributed into parts more than\r\n      the one, into parts equal to the one; the one is never wanting to being,\r\n      or being to the one, but being two they are co-equal and co-extensive.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly that is true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one itself, then, having been broken up into parts by being, is many\r\n      and infinite?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then not only the one which has being is many, but the one itself\r\n      distributed by being, must also be many?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Further, inasmuch as the parts are parts of a whole, the one, as a whole,\r\n      will be limited; for are not the parts contained by the whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which contains, is a limit?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one if it has being is one and many, whole and parts, having\r\n      limits and yet unlimited in number?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And because having limits, also having extremes?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if a whole, having beginning and middle and end. For can anything be a\r\n      whole without these three? And if any one of them is wanting to anything,\r\n      will that any longer be a whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, as appears, will have beginning, middle, and end.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It will.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But, again, the middle will be equidistant from the extremes; or it would\r\n      not be in the middle?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one will partake of figure, either rectilinear or round, or a\r\n      union of the two?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if this is the case, it will be both in itself and in another too.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Every part is in the whole, and none is outside the whole.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And all the parts are contained by the whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one is all its parts, and neither more nor less than all?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one is the whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if all the parts are in the whole, and the one is all of them and the\r\n      whole, and they are all contained by the whole, the one will be contained\r\n      by the one; and thus the one will be in itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But then, again, the whole is not in the parts\u2014neither in all the\r\n      parts, nor in some one of them. For if it is in all, it must be in one;\r\n      for if there were any one in which it was not, it could not be in all the\r\n      parts; for the part in which it is wanting is one of all, and if the whole\r\n      is not in this, how can it be in them all?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor can the whole be in some of the parts; for if the whole were in some\r\n      of the parts, the greater would be in the less, which is impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if the whole is neither in one, nor in more than one, nor in all of\r\n      the parts, it must be in something else, or cease to be anywhere at all?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If it were nowhere, it would be nothing; but being a whole, and not being\r\n      in itself, it must be in another.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one then, regarded as a whole, is in another, but regarded as being\r\n      all its parts, is in itself; and therefore the one must be itself in\r\n      itself and also in another.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one then, being of this nature, is of necessity both at rest and in\r\n      motion?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one is at rest since it is in itself, for being in one, and not\r\n      passing out of this, it is in the same, which is itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which is ever in the same, must be ever at rest?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Well, and must not that, on the contrary, which is ever in other, never be\r\n      in the same; and if never in the same, never at rest, and if not at rest,\r\n      in motion?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one being always itself in itself and other, must always be both\r\n      at rest and in motion?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And must be the same with itself, and other than itself; and also the same\r\n      with the others, and other than the others; this follows from its previous\r\n      affections.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How so?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Everything in relation to every other thing, is either the same or other;\r\n      or if neither the same nor other, then in the relation of a part to a\r\n      whole, or of a whole to a part.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And is the one a part of itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Since it is not a part in relation to itself it cannot be related to\r\n      itself as whole to part?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But is the one other than one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And therefore not other than itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If then it be neither other, nor a whole, nor a part in relation to\r\n      itself, must it not be the same with itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But then, again, a thing which is in another place from 'itself,' if this\r\n      'itself' remains in the same place with itself, must be other than\r\n      'itself,' for it will be in another place?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one has been shown to be at once in itself and in another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Thus, then, as appears, the one will be other than itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Well, then, if anything be other than anything, will it not be other than\r\n      that which is other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And will not all things that are not one, be other than the one, and the\r\n      one other than the not-one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one will be other than the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But, consider:\u2014Are not the absolute same, and the absolute other,\r\n      opposites to one another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then will the same ever be in the other, or the other in the same?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They will not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If then the other is never in the same, there is nothing in which the\r\n      other is during any space of time; for during that space of time, however\r\n      small, the other would be in the same. Is not that true?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And since the other is never in the same, it can never be in anything that\r\n      is.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the other will never be either in the not-one, or in the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then not by reason of otherness is the one other than the not-one, or the\r\n      not-one other than the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor by reason of themselves will they be other than one another, if not\r\n      partaking of the other.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How can they be?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if they are not other, either by reason of themselves or of the other,\r\n      will they not altogether escape being other than one another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They will.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Again, the not-one cannot partake of the one; otherwise it would not have\r\n      been not-one, but would have been in some way one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor can the not-one be number; for having number, it would not have been\r\n      not-one at all.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Again, is the not-one part of the one; or rather, would it not in that\r\n      case partake of the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If then, in every point of view, the one and the not-one are distinct,\r\n      then neither is the one part or whole of the not-one, nor is the not-one\r\n      part or whole of the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But we said that things which are neither parts nor wholes of one another,\r\n      nor other than one another, will be the same with one another:\u2014so we\r\n      said?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then shall we say that the one, being in this relation to the not-one, is\r\n      the same with it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us say so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it is the same with itself and the others, and also other than itself\r\n      and the others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That appears to be the inference.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And it will also be like and unlike itself and the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Perhaps.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Since the one was shown to be other than the others, the others will also\r\n      be other than the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one is other than the others in the same degree that the others\r\n      are other than it, and neither more nor less?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if neither more nor less, then in a like degree?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In virtue of the affection by which the one is other than others and\r\n      others in like manner other than it, the one will be affected like the\r\n      others and the others like the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How do you mean?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I may take as an illustration the case of names: You give a name to a\r\n      thing?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And you may say the name once or oftener?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And when you say it once, you mention that of which it is the name? and\r\n      when more than once, is it something else which you mention? or must it\r\n      always be the same thing of which you speak, whether you utter the name\r\n      once or more than once?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course it is the same.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And is not 'other' a name given to a thing?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Whenever, then, you use the word 'other,' whether once or oftener, you\r\n      name that of which it is the name, and to no other do you give the name?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then when we say that the others are other than the one, and the one other\r\n      than the others, in repeating the word 'other' we speak of that nature to\r\n      which the name is applied, and of no other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one which is other than others, and the other which is other than\r\n      the one, in that the word 'other' is applied to both, will be in the same\r\n      condition; and that which is in the same condition is like?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then in virtue of the affection by which the one is other than the others,\r\n      every thing will be like every thing, for every thing is other than every\r\n      thing.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Again, the like is opposed to the unlike?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the other to the same?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True again.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one was also shown to be the same with the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And to be the same with the others is the opposite of being other than the\r\n      others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And in that it was other it was shown to be like?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But in that it was the same it will be unlike by virtue of the opposite\r\n      affection to that which made it like; and this was the affection of\r\n      otherness.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The same then will make it unlike; otherwise it will not be the opposite\r\n      of the other.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one will be both like and unlike the others; like in so far as it\r\n      is other, and unlike in so far as it is the same.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, that argument may be used.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And there is another argument.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In so far as it is affected in the same way it is not affected otherwise,\r\n      and not being affected otherwise is not unlike, and not being unlike, is\r\n      like; but in so far as it is affected by other it is otherwise, and being\r\n      otherwise affected is unlike.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then because the one is the same with the others and other than the\r\n      others, on either of these two grounds, or on both of them, it will be\r\n      both like and unlike the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And in the same way as being other than itself and the same with itself,\r\n      on either of these two grounds and on both of them, it will be like and\r\n      unlike itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Again, how far can the one touch or not touch itself and others?\u2014consider.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I am considering.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one was shown to be in itself which was a whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And also in other things?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In so far as it is in other things it would touch other things, but in so\r\n      far as it is in itself it would be debarred from touching them, and would\r\n      touch itself only.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the inference is that it would touch both?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But what do you say to a new point of view? Must not that which is to\r\n      touch another be next to that which it is to touch, and occupy the place\r\n      nearest to that in which what it touches is situated?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, if it is to touch itself, ought to be situated next to\r\n      itself, and occupy the place next to that in which itself is?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It ought.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that would require that the one should be two, and be in two places at\r\n      once, and this, while it is one, will never happen.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one cannot touch itself any more than it can be two?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Neither can it touch others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The reason is, that whatever is to touch another must be in separation\r\n      from, and next to, that which it is to touch, and no third thing can be\r\n      between them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Two things, then, at the least are necessary to make contact possible?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They are.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if to the two a third be added in due order, the number of terms will\r\n      be three, and the contacts two?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And every additional term makes one additional contact, whence it follows\r\n      that the contacts are one less in number than the terms; the first two\r\n      terms exceeded the number of contacts by one, and the whole number of\r\n      terms exceeds the whole number of contacts by one in like manner; and for\r\n      every one which is afterwards added to the number of terms, one contact is\r\n      added to the contacts.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Whatever is the whole number of things, the contacts will be always one\r\n      less.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if there be only one, and not two, there will be no contact?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How can there be?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And do we not say that the others being other than the one are not one and\r\n      have no part in the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then they have no number, if they have no one in them?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the others are neither one nor two, nor are they called by the name\r\n      of any number?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      One, then, alone is one, and two do not exist?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if there are not two, there is no contact?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There is not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then neither does the one touch the others, nor the others the one, if\r\n      there is no contact?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      For all which reasons the one touches and does not touch itself and the\r\n      others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Further\u2014is the one equal and unequal to itself and others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How do you mean?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If the one were greater or less than the others, or the others greater or\r\n      less than the one, they would not be greater or less than each other in\r\n      virtue of their being the one and the others; but, if in addition to their\r\n      being what they are they had equality, they would be equal to one another,\r\n      or if the one had smallness and the others greatness, or the one had\r\n      greatness and the others smallness\u2014whichever kind had greatness\r\n      would be greater, and whichever had smallness would be smaller?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then there are two such ideas as greatness and smallness; for if they were\r\n      not they could not be opposed to each other and be present in that which\r\n      is.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How could they?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If, then, smallness is present in the one it will be present either in the\r\n      whole or in a part of the whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Suppose the first; it will be either co-equal and co-extensive with the\r\n      whole one, or will contain the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If it be co-extensive with the one it will be co-equal with the one, or if\r\n      containing the one it will be greater than the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But can smallness be equal to anything or greater than anything, and have\r\n      the functions of greatness and equality and not its own functions?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then smallness cannot be in the whole of one, but, if at all, in a part\r\n      only?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And surely not in all of a part, for then the difficulty of the whole will\r\n      recur; it will be equal to or greater than any part in which it is.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then smallness will not be in anything, whether in a whole or in a part;\r\n      nor will there be anything small but actual smallness.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Neither will greatness be in the one, for if greatness be in anything\r\n      there will be something greater other and besides greatness itself,\r\n      namely, that in which greatness is; and this too when the small itself is\r\n      not there, which the one, if it is great, must exceed; this, however, is\r\n      impossible, seeing that smallness is wholly absent.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But absolute greatness is only greater than absolute smallness, and\r\n      smallness is only smaller than absolute greatness.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then other things not greater or less than the one, if they have neither\r\n      greatness nor smallness; nor have greatness or smallness any power of\r\n      exceeding or being exceeded in relation to the one, but only in relation\r\n      to one another; nor will the one be greater or less than them or others,\r\n      if it has neither greatness nor smallness.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then if the one is neither greater nor less than the others, it cannot\r\n      either exceed or be exceeded by them?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which neither exceeds nor is exceeded, must be on an equality;\r\n      and being on an equality, must be equal.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And this will be true also of the relation of the one to itself; having\r\n      neither greatness nor smallness in itself, it will neither exceed nor be\r\n      exceeded by itself, but will be on an equality with and equal to itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one will be equal both to itself and the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And yet the one, being itself in itself, will also surround and be without\r\n      itself; and, as containing itself, will be greater than itself; and, as\r\n      contained in itself, will be less; and will thus be greater and less than\r\n      itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It will.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Now there cannot possibly be anything which is not included in the one and\r\n      the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But, surely, that which is must always be somewhere?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But that which is in anything will be less, and that in which it is will\r\n      be greater; in no other way can one thing be in another.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And since there is nothing other or besides the one and the others, and\r\n      they must be in something, must they not be in one another, the one in the\r\n      others and the others in the one, if they are to be anywhere?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is clear.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But inasmuch as the one is in the others, the others will be greater than\r\n      the one, because they contain the one, which will be less than the others,\r\n      because it is contained in them; and inasmuch as the others are in the\r\n      one, the one on the same principle will be greater than the others, and\r\n      the others less than the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one, then, will be equal to and greater and less than itself and the\r\n      others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if it be greater and less and equal, it will be of equal and more and\r\n      less measures or divisions than itself and the others, and if of measures,\r\n      also of parts?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if of equal and more and less measures or divisions, it will be in\r\n      number more or less than itself and the others, and likewise equal in\r\n      number to itself and to the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How is that?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It will be of more measures than those things which it exceeds, and of as\r\n      many parts as measures; and so with that to which it is equal, and that\r\n      than which it is less.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And being greater and less than itself, and equal to itself, it will be of\r\n      equal measures with itself and of more and fewer measures than itself; and\r\n      if of measures then also of parts?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It will.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And being of equal parts with itself, it will be numerically equal to\r\n      itself; and being of more parts, more, and being of less, less than\r\n      itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the same will hold of its relation to other things; inasmuch as it is\r\n      greater than them, it will be more in number than them; and inasmuch as it\r\n      is smaller, it will be less in number; and inasmuch as it is equal in size\r\n      to other things, it will be equal to them in number.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Once more, then, as would appear, the one will be in number both equal to\r\n      and more and less than both itself and all other things.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It will.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Does the one also partake of time? And is it and does it become older and\r\n      younger than itself and others, and again, neither younger nor older than\r\n      itself and others, by virtue of participation in time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How do you mean?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If one is, being must be predicated of it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But to be (einai) is only participation of being in present time, and to\r\n      have been is the participation of being at a past time, and to be about to\r\n      be is the participation of being at a future time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, since it partakes of being, partakes of time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And is not time always moving forward?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one is always becoming older than itself, since it moves forward\r\n      in time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And do you remember that the older becomes older than that which becomes\r\n      younger?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I remember.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then since the one becomes older than itself, it becomes younger at the\r\n      same time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Thus, then, the one becomes older as well as younger than itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And it is older (is it not?) when in becoming, it gets to the point of\r\n      time between 'was' and 'will be,' which is 'now': for surely in going from\r\n      the past to the future, it cannot skip the present?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And when it arrives at the present it stops from becoming older, and no\r\n      longer becomes, but is older, for if it went on it would never be reached\r\n      by the present, for it is the nature of that which goes on, to touch both\r\n      the present and the future, letting go the present and seizing the future,\r\n      while in process of becoming between them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But that which is becoming cannot skip the present; when it reaches the\r\n      present it ceases to become, and is then whatever it may happen to be\r\n      becoming.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And so the one, when in becoming older it reaches the present, ceases to\r\n      become, and is then older.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And it is older than that than which it was becoming older, and it was\r\n      becoming older than itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which is older is older than that which is younger?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one is younger than itself, when in becoming older it reaches the\r\n      present?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But the present is always present with the one during all its being; for\r\n      whenever it is it is always now.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one always both is and becomes older and younger than itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Truly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And is it or does it become a longer time than itself or an equal time\r\n      with itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      An equal time.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if it becomes or is for an equal time with itself, it is of the same\r\n      age with itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which is of the same age, is neither older nor younger?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one, then, becoming and being the same time with itself, neither is\r\n      nor becomes older or younger than itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I should say not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And what are its relations to other things? Is it or does it become older\r\n      or younger than they?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I cannot tell you.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      You can at least tell me that others than the one are more than the one\u2014other\r\n      would have been one, but the others have multitude, and are more than one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They will have multitude.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And a multitude implies a number larger than one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And shall we say that the lesser or the greater is the first to come or to\r\n      have come into existence?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The lesser.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the least is the first? And that is the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one of all things that have number is the first to come into\r\n      being; but all other things have also number, being plural and not\r\n      singular.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They have.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And since it came into being first it must be supposed to have come into\r\n      being prior to the others, and the others later; and the things which came\r\n      into being later, are younger than that which preceded them? And so the\r\n      other things will be younger than the one, and the one older than other\r\n      things?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What would you say of another question? Can the one have come into being\r\n      contrary to its own nature, or is that impossible?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And yet, surely, the one was shown to have parts; and if parts, then a\r\n      beginning, middle and end?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And a beginning, both of the one itself and of all other things, comes\r\n      into being first of all; and after the beginning, the others follow, until\r\n      you reach the end?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And all these others we shall affirm to be parts of the whole and of the\r\n      one, which, as soon as the end is reached, has become whole and one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes; that is what we shall say.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But the end comes last, and the one is of such a nature as to come into\r\n      being with the last; and, since the one cannot come into being except in\r\n      accordance with its own nature, its nature will require that it should\r\n      come into being after the others, simultaneously with the end.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one is younger than the others and the others older than the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That also is clear in my judgment.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Well, and must not a beginning or any other part of the one or of\r\n      anything, if it be a part and not parts, being a part, be also of\r\n      necessity one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And will not the one come into being together with each part\u2014together\r\n      with the first part when that comes into being, and together with the\r\n      second part and with all the rest, and will not be wanting to any part,\r\n      which is added to any other part until it has reached the last and become\r\n      one whole; it will be wanting neither to the middle, nor to the first, nor\r\n      to the last, nor to any of them, while the process of becoming is going\r\n      on?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one is of the same age with all the others, so that if the one\r\n      itself does not contradict its own nature, it will be neither prior nor\r\n      posterior to the others, but simultaneous; and according to this argument\r\n      the one will be neither older nor younger than the others, nor the others\r\n      than the one, but according to the previous argument the one will be older\r\n      and younger than the others and the others than the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      After this manner then the one is and has become. But as to its becoming\r\n      older and younger than the others, and the others than the one, and\r\n      neither older nor younger, what shall we say? Shall we say as of being so\r\n      also of becoming, or otherwise?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I cannot answer.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But I can venture to say, that even if one thing were older or younger\r\n      than another, it could not become older or younger in a greater degree\r\n      than it was at first; for equals added to unequals, whether to periods of\r\n      time or to anything else, leave the difference between them the same as at\r\n      first.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then that which is, cannot become older or younger than that which is,\r\n      since the difference of age is always the same; the one is and has become\r\n      older and the other younger; but they are no longer becoming so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one which is does not therefore become either older or younger\r\n      than the others which are.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But consider whether they may not become older and younger in another way.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In what way?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Just as the one was proven to be older than the others and the others than\r\n      the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And what of that?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If the one is older than the others, has come into being a longer time\r\n      than the others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But consider again; if we add equal time to a greater and a less time,\r\n      will the greater differ from the less time by an equal or by a smaller\r\n      portion than before?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      By a smaller portion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the difference between the age of the one and the age of the others\r\n      will not be afterwards so great as at first, but if an equal time be added\r\n      to both of them they will differ less and less in age?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And that which differs in age from some other less than formerly, from\r\n      being older will become younger in relation to that other than which it\r\n      was older?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, younger.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if the one becomes younger the others aforesaid will become older than\r\n      they were before, in relation to the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then that which had become younger becomes older relatively to that which\r\n      previously had become and was older; it never really is older, but is\r\n      always becoming, for the one is always growing on the side of youth and\r\n      the other on the side of age. And in like manner the older is always in\r\n      process of becoming younger than the younger; for as they are always going\r\n      in opposite directions they become in ways the opposite to one another,\r\n      the younger older than the older, and the older younger than the younger.\r\n      They cannot, however, have become; for if they had already become they\r\n      would be and not merely become. But that is impossible; for they are\r\n      always becoming both older and younger than one another: the one becomes\r\n      younger than the others because it was seen to be older and prior, and the\r\n      others become older than the one because they came into being later; and\r\n      in the same way the others are in the same relation to the one, because\r\n      they were seen to be older, and prior to the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is clear.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Inasmuch then, one thing does not become older or younger than another, in\r\n      that they always differ from each other by an equal number, the one cannot\r\n      become older or younger than the others, nor the others than the one; but\r\n      inasmuch as that which came into being earlier and that which came into\r\n      being later must continually differ from each other by a different portion\u2014in\r\n      this point of view the others must become older and younger than the one,\r\n      and the one than the others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      For all these reasons, then, the one is and becomes older and younger than\r\n      itself and the others, and neither is nor becomes older or younger than\r\n      itself or the others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But since the one partakes of time, and partakes of becoming older and\r\n      younger, must it not also partake of the past, the present, and the\r\n      future?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course it must.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one was and is and will be, and was becoming and is becoming and\r\n      will become?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And there is and was and will be something which is in relation to it and\r\n      belongs to it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And since we have at this moment opinion and knowledge and perception of\r\n      the one, there is opinion and knowledge and perception of it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite right.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then there is name and expression for it, and it is named and expressed,\r\n      and everything of this kind which appertains to other things appertains to\r\n      the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly, that is true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yet once more and for the third time, let us consider: If the one is both\r\n      one and many, as we have described, and is neither one nor many, and\r\n      participates in time, must it not, in as far as it is one, at times\r\n      partake of being, and in as far as it is not one, at times not partake of\r\n      being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But can it partake of being when not partaking of being, or not partake of\r\n      being when partaking of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one partakes and does not partake of being at different times,\r\n      for that is the only way in which it can partake and not partake of the\r\n      same.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And is there not also a time at which it assumes being and relinquishes\r\n      being\u2014for how can it have and not have the same thing unless it\r\n      receives and also gives it up at some time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the assuming of being is what you would call becoming?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I should.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the relinquishing of being you would call destruction?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      I should.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one then, as would appear, becomes and is destroyed by taking and\r\n      giving up being.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And being one and many and in process of becoming and being destroyed,\r\n      when it becomes one it ceases to be many, and when many, it ceases to be\r\n      one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And as it becomes one and many, must it not inevitably experience\r\n      separation and aggregation?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Inevitably.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And whenever it becomes like and unlike it must be assimilated and\r\n      dissimilated?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And when it becomes greater or less or equal it must grow or diminish or\r\n      be equalized?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And when being in motion it rests, and when being at rest it changes to\r\n      motion, it can surely be in no time at all?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How can it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But that a thing which is previously at rest should be afterwards in\r\n      motion, or previously in motion and afterwards at rest, without\r\n      experiencing change, is impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And surely there cannot be a time in which a thing can be at once neither\r\n      in motion nor at rest?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But neither can it change without changing.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      When then does it change; for it cannot change either when at rest, or\r\n      when in motion, or when in time?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And does this strange thing in which it is at the time of changing really\r\n      exist?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What thing?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The moment. For the moment seems to imply a something out of which change\r\n      takes place into either of two states; for the change is not from the\r\n      state of rest as such, nor from the state of motion as such; but there is\r\n      this curious nature which we call the moment lying between rest and\r\n      motion, not being in any time; and into this and out of this what is in\r\n      motion changes into rest, and what is at rest into motion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      So it appears.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one then, since it is at rest and also in motion, will change to\r\n      either, for only in this way can it be in both. And in changing it changes\r\n      in a moment, and when it is changing it will be in no time, and will not\r\n      then be either in motion or at rest.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It will not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And it will be in the same case in relation to the other changes, when it\r\n      passes from being into cessation of being, or from not-being into becoming\u2014then\r\n      it passes between certain states of motion and rest, and neither is nor is\r\n      not, nor becomes nor is destroyed.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And on the same principle, in the passage from one to many and from many\r\n      to one, the one is neither one nor many, neither separated nor aggregated;\r\n      and in the passage from like to unlike, and from unlike to like, it is\r\n      neither like nor unlike, neither in a state of assimilation nor of\r\n      dissimilation; and in the passage from small to great and equal and back\r\n      again, it will be neither small nor great, nor equal, nor in a state of\r\n      increase, or diminution, or equalization.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      All these, then, are the affections of the one, if the one has being.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      1.aa. But if one is, what will happen to the others\u2014is not that also\r\n      to be considered?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us show then, if one is, what will be the affections of the others\r\n      than the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us do so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Inasmuch as there are things other than the one, the others are not the\r\n      one; for if they were they could not be other than the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor are the others altogether without the one, but in a certain way they\r\n      participate in the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In what way?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because the others are other than the one inasmuch as they have parts; for\r\n      if they had no parts they would be simply one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Right.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And parts, as we affirm, have relation to a whole?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      So we say.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And a whole must necessarily be one made up of many; and the parts will be\r\n      parts of the one, for each of the parts is not a part of many, but of a\r\n      whole.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How do you mean?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If anything were a part of many, being itself one of them, it will surely\r\n      be a part of itself, which is impossible, and it will be a part of each\r\n      one of the other parts, if of all; for if not a part of some one, it will\r\n      be a part of all the others but this one, and thus will not be a part of\r\n      each one; and if not a part of each, one it will not be a part of any one\r\n      of the many; and not being a part of any one, it cannot be a part or\r\n      anything else of all those things of none of which it is anything.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the part is not a part of the many, nor of all, but is of a certain\r\n      single form, which we call a whole, being one perfect unity framed out of\r\n      all\u2014of this the part will be a part.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If, then, the others have parts, they will participate in the whole and in\r\n      the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the others than the one must be one perfect whole, having parts.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the same argument holds of each part, for the part must participate in\r\n      the one; for if each of the parts is a part, this means, I suppose, that\r\n      it is one separate from the rest and self-related; otherwise it is not\r\n      each.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But when we speak of the part participating in the one, it must clearly be\r\n      other than one; for if not, it would not merely have participated, but\r\n      would have been one; whereas only the itself can be one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Both the whole and the part must participate in the one; for the whole\r\n      will be one whole, of which the parts will be parts; and each part will be\r\n      one part of the whole which is the whole of the part.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And will not the things which participate in the one, be other than it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the things which are other than the one will be many; for if the\r\n      things which are other than the one were neither one nor more than one,\r\n      they would be nothing.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But, seeing that the things which participate in the one as a part, and in\r\n      the one as a whole, are more than one, must not those very things which\r\n      participate in the one be infinite in number?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How so?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us look at the matter thus:\u2014Is it not a fact that in partaking\r\n      of the one they are not one, and do not partake of the one at the very\r\n      time when they are partaking of it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They do so then as multitudes in which the one is not present?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if we were to abstract from them in idea the very smallest fraction,\r\n      must not that least fraction, if it does not partake of the one, be a\r\n      multitude and not one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It must.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if we continue to look at the other side of their nature, regarded\r\n      simply, and in itself, will not they, as far as we see them, be unlimited\r\n      in number?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And yet, when each several part becomes a part, then the parts have a\r\n      limit in relation to the whole and to each other, and the whole in\r\n      relation to the parts.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Just so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The result to the others than the one is that the union of themselves and\r\n      the one appears to create a new element in them which gives to them\r\n      limitation in relation to one another; whereas in their own nature they\r\n      have no limit.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is clear.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the others than the one, both as whole and parts, are infinite, and\r\n      also partake of limit.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then they are both like and unlike one another and themselves.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How is that?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Inasmuch as they are unlimited in their own nature, they are all affected\r\n      in the same way.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And inasmuch as they all partake of limit, they are all affected in the\r\n      same way.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But inasmuch as their state is both limited and unlimited, they are\r\n      affected in opposite ways.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And opposites are the most unlike of things.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Considered, then, in regard to either one of their affections, they will\r\n      be like themselves and one another; considered in reference to both of\r\n      them together, most opposed and most unlike.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That appears to be true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the others are both like and unlike themselves and one another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And they are the same and also different from one another, and in motion\r\n      and at rest, and experience every sort of opposite affection, as may be\r\n      proved without difficulty of them, since they have been shown to have\r\n      experienced the affections aforesaid?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      1.bb. Suppose, now, that we leave the further discussion of these matters\r\n      as evident, and consider again upon the hypothesis that the one is,\r\n      whether opposite of all this is or is not equally true of the others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      By all means.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then let us begin again, and ask, If one is, what must be the affections\r\n      of the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us ask that question.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Must not the one be distinct from the others, and the others from the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why so?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why, because there is nothing else beside them which is distinct from both\r\n      of them; for the expression 'one and the others' includes all things.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, all things.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then we cannot suppose that there is anything different from them in which\r\n      both the one and the others might exist?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There is nothing.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one and the others are never in the same?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then they are separated from each other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And we surely cannot say that what is truly one has parts?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one will not be in the others as a whole, nor as part, if it be\r\n      separated from the others, and has no parts?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then there is no way in which the others can partake of the one, if they\r\n      do not partake either in whole or in part?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would seem not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then there is no way in which the others are one, or have in themselves\r\n      any unity?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There is not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor are the others many; for if they were many, each part of them would be\r\n      a part of the whole; but now the others, not partaking in any way of the\r\n      one, are neither one nor many, nor whole, nor part.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the others neither are nor contain two or three, if entirely deprived\r\n      of the one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the others are neither like nor unlike the one, nor is likeness and\r\n      unlikeness in them; for if they were like and unlike, or had in them\r\n      likeness and unlikeness, they would have two natures in them opposite to\r\n      one another.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is clear.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But for that which partakes of nothing to partake of two things was held\r\n      by us to be impossible?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the others are neither like nor unlike nor both, for if they were\r\n      like or unlike they would partake of one of those two natures, which would\r\n      be one thing, and if they were both they would partake of opposites which\r\n      would be two things, and this has been shown to be impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Therefore they are neither the same, nor other, nor in motion, nor at\r\n      rest, nor in a state of becoming, nor of being destroyed, nor greater, nor\r\n      less, nor equal, nor have they experienced anything else of the sort; for,\r\n      if they are capable of experiencing any such affection, they will\r\n      participate in one and two and three, and odd and even, and in these, as\r\n      has been proved, they do not participate, seeing that they are altogether\r\n      and in every way devoid of the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Therefore if one is, the one is all things, and also nothing, both in\r\n      relation to itself and to other things.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      2.a. Well, and ought we not to consider next what will be the consequence\r\n      if the one is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes; we ought.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      What is the meaning of the hypothesis\u2014If the one is not; is there\r\n      any difference between this and the hypothesis\u2014If the not one is\r\n      not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There is a difference, certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Is there a difference only, or rather are not the two expressions\u2014if\r\n      the one is not, and if the not one is not, entirely opposed?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They are entirely opposed.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And suppose a person to say:\u2014If greatness is not, if smallness is\r\n      not, or anything of that sort, does he not mean, whenever he uses such an\r\n      expression, that 'what is not' is other than other things?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      To be sure.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And so when he says 'If one is not' he clearly means, that what 'is not'\r\n      is other than all others; we know what he means\u2014do we not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, we do.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      When he says 'one,' he says something which is known; and secondly\r\n      something which is other than all other things; it makes no difference\r\n      whether he predicate of one being or not-being, for that which is said\r\n      'not to be' is known to be something all the same, and is distinguished\r\n      from other things.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then I will begin again, and ask: If one is not, what are the\r\n      consequences? In the first place, as would appear, there is a knowledge of\r\n      it, or the very meaning of the words, 'if one is not,' would not be known.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Secondly, the others differ from it, or it could not be described as\r\n      different from the others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Difference, then, belongs to it as well as knowledge; for in speaking of\r\n      the one as different from the others, we do not speak of a difference in\r\n      the others, but in the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Moreover, the one that is not is something and partakes of relation to\r\n      'that,' and 'this,' and 'these,' and the like, and is an attribute of\r\n      'this'; for the one, or the others than the one, could not have been\r\n      spoken of, nor could any attribute or relative of the one that is not have\r\n      been or been spoken of, nor could it have been said to be anything, if it\r\n      did not partake of 'some,' or of the other relations just now mentioned.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Being, then, cannot be ascribed to the one, since it is not; but the one\r\n      that is not may or rather must participate in many things, if it and\r\n      nothing else is not; if, however, neither the one nor the one that is not\r\n      is supposed not to be, and we are speaking of something of a different\r\n      nature, we can predicate nothing of it. But supposing that the one that is\r\n      not and nothing else is not, then it must participate in the predicate\r\n      'that,' and in many others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And it will have unlikeness in relation to the others, for the others\r\n      being different from the one will be of a different kind.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And are not things of a different kind also other in kind?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And are not things other in kind unlike?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They are unlike.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if they are unlike the one, that which they are unlike will clearly be\r\n      unlike them?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one will have unlikeness in respect of which the others are\r\n      unlike it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That would seem to be true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And if unlikeness to other things is attributed to it, it must have\r\n      likeness to itself.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How so?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If the one have unlikeness to one, something else must be meant; nor will\r\n      the hypothesis relate to one; but it will relate to something other than\r\n      one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But that cannot be.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one must have likeness to itself?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It must.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Again, it is not equal to the others; for if it were equal, then it would\r\n      at once be and be like them in virtue of the equality; but if one has no\r\n      being, then it can neither be nor be like?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But since it is not equal to the others, neither can the others be equal\r\n      to it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And things that are not equal are unequal?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And they are unequal to an unequal?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one partakes of inequality, and in respect of this the others are\r\n      unequal to it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And inequality implies greatness and smallness?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, if of such a nature, has greatness and smallness?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That appears to be true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And greatness and smallness always stand apart?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then there is always something between them?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      There is.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And can you think of anything else which is between them other than\r\n      equality?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No, it is equality which lies between them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then that which has greatness and smallness also has equality, which lies\r\n      between them?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is clear.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, which is not, partakes, as would appear, of greatness and\r\n      smallness and equality?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Further, it must surely in a sort partake of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How so?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It must be so, for if not, then we should not speak the truth in saying\r\n      that the one is not. But if we speak the truth, clearly we must say what\r\n      is. Am I not right?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And since we affirm that we speak truly, we must also affirm that we say\r\n      what is?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, as would appear, the one, when it is not, is; for if it were not to\r\n      be when it is not, but (Or, 'to remit something of existence in relation\r\n      to not-being.') were to relinquish something of being, so as to become\r\n      not-being, it would at once be.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one which is not, if it is to maintain itself, must have the\r\n      being of not-being as the bond of not-being, just as being must have as a\r\n      bond the not-being of not-being in order to perfect its own being; for the\r\n      truest assertion of the being of being and of the not-being of not-being\r\n      is when being partakes of the being of being, and not of the being of\r\n      not-being\u2014that is, the perfection of being; and when not-being does\r\n      not partake of the not-being of not-being but of the being of not-being\u2014that\r\n      is the perfection of not-being.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Most true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Since then what is partakes of not-being, and what is not of being, must\r\n      not the one also partake of being in order not to be?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, if it is not, clearly has being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And has not-being also, if it is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But can anything which is in a certain state not be in that state without\r\n      changing?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then everything which is and is not in a certain state, implies change?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And change is motion\u2014we may say that?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes, motion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one has been proved both to be and not to be?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And therefore is and is not in the same state?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Thus the one that is not has been shown to have motion also, because it\r\n      changes from being to not-being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That appears to be true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But surely if it is nowhere among what is, as is the fact, since it is\r\n      not, it cannot change from one place to another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it cannot move by changing place?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor can it turn on the same spot, for it nowhere touches the same, for the\r\n      same is, and that which is not cannot be reckoned among things that are?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, if it is not, cannot turn in that in which it is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Neither can the one, whether it is or is not, be altered into other than\r\n      itself, for if it altered and became different from itself, then we could\r\n      not be still speaking of the one, but of something else?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if the one neither suffers alteration, nor turns round in the same\r\n      place, nor changes place, can it still be capable of motion?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Now that which is unmoved must surely be at rest, and that which is at\r\n      rest must stand still?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one that is not, stands still, and is also in motion?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That seems to be true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if it be in motion it must necessarily undergo alteration, for\r\n      anything which is moved, in so far as it is moved, is no longer in the\r\n      same state, but in another?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one, being moved, is altered?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And, further, if not moved in any way, it will not be altered in any way?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, in so far as the one that is not is moved, it is altered, but in so\r\n      far as it is not moved, it is not altered?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Right.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one that is not is altered and is not altered?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is clear.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And must not that which is altered become other than it previously was,\r\n      and lose its former state and be destroyed; but that which is not altered\r\n      can neither come into being nor be destroyed?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And the one that is not, being altered, becomes and is destroyed; and not\r\n      being altered, neither becomes nor is destroyed; and so the one that is\r\n      not becomes and is destroyed, and neither becomes nor is destroyed?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      2.b. And now, let us go back once more to the beginning, and see whether\r\n      these or some other consequences will follow.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us do as you say.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If one is not, we ask what will happen in respect of one? That is the\r\n      question.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Do not the words 'is not' signify absence of being in that to which we\r\n      apply them?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Just so.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And when we say that a thing is not, do we mean that it is not in one way\r\n      but is in another? or do we mean, absolutely, that what is not has in no\r\n      sort or way or kind participation of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Quite absolutely.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, that which is not cannot be, or in any way participate in being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And did we not mean by becoming, and being destroyed, the assumption of\r\n      being and the loss of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nothing else.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And can that which has no participation in being, either assume or lose\r\n      being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The one then, since it in no way is, cannot have or lose or assume being\r\n      in any way?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one that is not, since it in no way partakes of being, neither\r\n      perishes nor becomes?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then it is not altered at all; for if it were it would become and be\r\n      destroyed?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But if it be not altered it cannot be moved?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor can we say that it stands, if it is nowhere; for that which stands\r\n      must always be in one and the same spot?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Of course.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then we must say that the one which is not never stands still and never\r\n      moves?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Neither.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor is there any existing thing which can be attributed to it; for if\r\n      there had been, it would partake of being?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      That is clear.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And therefore neither smallness, nor greatness, nor equality, can be\r\n      attributed to it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor yet likeness nor difference, either in relation to itself or to\r\n      others?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Clearly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Well, and if nothing should be attributed to it, can other things be\r\n      attributed to it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And therefore other things can neither be like or unlike, the same, or\r\n      different in relation to it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor can what is not, be anything, or be this thing, or be related to or\r\n      the attribute of this or that or other, or be past, present, or future.\r\n      Nor can knowledge, or opinion, or perception, or expression, or name, or\r\n      any other thing that is, have any concern with it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then the one that is not has no condition of any kind?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Such appears to be the conclusion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      2.aa. Yet once more; if one is not, what becomes of the others? Let us\r\n      determine that.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes; let us determine that.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      The others must surely be; for if they, like the one, were not, we could\r\n      not be now speaking of them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But to speak of the others implies difference\u2014the terms 'other' and\r\n      'different' are synonymous?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Other means other than other, and different, different from the different?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then, if there are to be others, there is something than which they will\r\n      be other?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And what can that be?\u2014for if the one is not, they will not be other\r\n      than the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They will not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then they will be other than each other; for the only remaining\r\n      alternative is that they are other than nothing.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And they are each other than one another, as being plural and not\r\n      singular; for if one is not, they cannot be singular, but every particle\r\n      of them is infinite in number; and even if a person takes that which\r\n      appears to be the smallest fraction, this, which seemed one, in a moment\r\n      evanesces into many, as in a dream, and from being the smallest becomes\r\n      very great, in comparison with the fractions into which it is split up?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And in such particles the others will be other than one another, if others\r\n      are, and the one is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Exactly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And will there not be many particles, each appearing to be one, but not\r\n      being one, if one is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And it would seem that number can be predicated of them if each of them\r\n      appears to be one, though it is really many?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It can.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And there will seem to be odd and even among them, which will also have no\r\n      reality, if one is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And there will appear to be a least among them; and even this will seem\r\n      large and manifold in comparison with the many small fractions which are\r\n      contained in it?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And each particle will be imagined to be equal to the many and little; for\r\n      it could not have appeared to pass from the greater to the less without\r\n      having appeared to arrive at the middle; and thus would arise the\r\n      appearance of equality.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Yes.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And having neither beginning, middle, nor end, each separate particle yet\r\n      appears to have a limit in relation to itself and other.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      How so?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because, when a person conceives of any one of these as such, prior to the\r\n      beginning another beginning appears, and there is another end, remaining\r\n      after the end, and in the middle truer middles within but smaller, because\r\n      no unity can be conceived of any of them, since the one is not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Very true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And so all being, whatever we think of, must be broken up into fractions,\r\n      for a particle will have to be conceived of without unity?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And such being when seen indistinctly and at a distance, appears to be\r\n      one; but when seen near and with keen intellect, every single thing\r\n      appears to be infinite, since it is deprived of the one, which is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nothing more certain.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then each of the others must appear to be infinite and finite, and one and\r\n      many, if others than the one exist and not the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They must.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then will they not appear to be like and unlike?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In what way?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Just as in a picture things appear to be all one to a person standing at a\r\n      distance, and to be in the same state and alike?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      But when you approach them, they appear to be many and different; and\r\n      because of the appearance of the difference, different in kind from, and\r\n      unlike, themselves?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And so must the particles appear to be like and unlike themselves and each\r\n      other.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      And must they not be the same and yet different from one another, and in\r\n      contact with themselves, although they are separated, and having every\r\n      sort of motion, and every sort of rest, and becoming and being destroyed,\r\n      and in neither state, and the like, all which things may be easily\r\n      enumerated, if the one is not and the many are?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Most true.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      2.bb. Once more, let us go back to the beginning, and ask if the one is\r\n      not, and the others of the one are, what will follow.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let us ask that question.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      In the first place, the others will not be one?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Impossible.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor will they be many; for if they were many one would be contained in\r\n      them. But if no one of them is one, all of them are nought, and therefore\r\n      they will not be many.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      If there be no one in the others, the others are neither many nor one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      They are not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor do they appear either as one or many.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Why not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Because the others have no sort or manner or way of communion with any\r\n      sort of not-being, nor can anything which is not, be connected with any of\r\n      the others; for that which is not has no parts.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor is there an opinion or any appearance of not-being in connexion with\r\n      the others, nor is not-being ever in any way attributed to the others.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then if one is not, there is no conception of any of the others either as\r\n      one or many; for you cannot conceive the many without the one.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      You cannot.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then if one is not, the others neither are, nor can be conceived to be\r\n      either one or many?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      It would seem not.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor as like or unlike?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      No.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nor as the same or different, nor in contact or separation, nor in any of\r\n      those states which we enumerated as appearing to be;\u2014the others\r\n      neither are nor appear to be any of these, if one is not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      True.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Then may we not sum up the argument in a word and say truly: If one is\r\n      not, then nothing is?\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Certainly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Let thus much be said; and further let us affirm what seems to be the\r\n      truth, that, whether one is or is not, one and the others in relation to\r\n      themselves and one another, all of them, in every way, are and are not,\r\n      and appear to be and appear not to be.\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Most true.

I went down into the under-world of London with an attitude\r\n\r\nof mind which I may best liken to that of the explorer. I was\r\n\r\nopen to be convinced by the evidence of my eyes, rather than by the\r\n\r\nteachings of those who had not seen, or by the words of those who had\r\n\r\nseen and gone before. Further, I took with me certain simple criteria\r\n\r\nwith which to measure the life of the under-world. That which\r\n\r\nmade for more life, for physical and spiritual health, was good; that\r\n\r\nwhich made for less life, which hurt, and dwarfed, and distorted life,\r\n\r\nwas bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be readily apparent to the reader that I saw much that was\r\n\r\nbad. Yet it must not be forgotten that the time of which I write\r\n\r\nwas considered \u201cgood times\u201d in England. The starvation\r\n\r\nand lack of shelter I encountered constituted a chronic condition of\r\n\r\nmisery which is never wiped out, even in the periods of greatest prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the summer in question came a hard winter. Great\r\n\r\nnumbers of the unemployed formed into processions, as many as a dozen\r\n\r\nat a time, and daily marched through the streets of London crying for\r\n\r\nbread. Mr. Justin McCarthy, writing in the month of January 1903,\r\n\r\nto the New York Independent, briefly epitomises the situation\r\n\r\nas follows:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe workhouses have no space left in which to\r\n\r\npack the starving crowds who are craving every day and night at their\r\n\r\ndoors for food and shelter. All the charitable institutions have\r\n\r\nexhausted their means in trying to raise supplies of food for the famishing\r\n\r\nresidents of the garrets and cellars of London lanes and alleys.\r\n\r\nThe quarters of the Salvation Army in various parts of London are nightly\r\n\r\nbesieged by hosts of the unemployed and the hungry for whom neither\r\n\r\nshelter nor the means of sustenance can be provided.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been urged that the criticism I have passed on things as they\r\n\r\nare in England is too pessimistic. I must say, in extenuation,\r\n\r\nthat of optimists I am the most optimistic. But I measure manhood\r\n\r\nless by political aggregations than by individuals. Society grows,\r\n\r\nwhile political machines rack to pieces and become \u201cscrap.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the English, so far as manhood and womanhood and health and happiness\r\n\r\ngo, I see a broad and smiling future. But for a great deal of\r\n\r\nthe political machinery, which at present mismanages for them, I see\r\n\r\nnothing else than the scrap heap.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIEDMONT, CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t do it, you know,\u201d friends said,\r\n\r\nto whom I applied for assistance in the matter of sinking myself down\r\n\r\ninto the East End of London. \u201cYou had better see the police\r\n\r\nfor a guide,\u201d they added, on second thought, painfully endeavouring\r\n\r\nto adjust themselves to the psychological processes of a madman who\r\n\r\nhad come to them with better credentials than brains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to see the police,\u201d I protested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I wish to do is to go down into the East End and see things\r\n\r\nfor myself. I wish to know how those people are living there,\r\n\r\nand why they are living there, and what they are living for. In\r\n\r\nshort, I am going to live there myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to live down there!\u201d everybody\r\n\r\nsaid, with disapprobation writ large upon their faces. \u201cWhy,\r\n\r\nit is said there are places where a man\u2019s life isn\u2019t worth\r\n\r\ntu\u2019pence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe very places I wish to see,\u201d I broke in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t, you know,\u201d was the unfailing rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich is not what I came to see you about,\u201d I answered\r\n\r\nbrusquely, somewhat nettled by their incomprehension. \u201cI\r\n\r\nam a stranger here, and I want you to tell me what you know of the East\r\n\r\nEnd, in order that I may have something to start on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we know nothing of the East End. It is over there,\r\n\r\nsomewhere.\u201d And they waved their hands vaguely in the direction\r\n\r\nwhere the sun on rare occasions may be seen to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall go to Cook\u2019s,\u201d I announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d they said, with relief. \u201cCook\u2019s\r\n\r\nwill be sure to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut O Cook, O Thomas Cook & Son, path-finders and trail-clearers,\r\n\r\nliving sign-posts to all the world, and bestowers of first aid to bewildered\r\n\r\ntravellers\u2014unhesitatingly and instantly, with ease and celerity,\r\n\r\ncould you send me to Darkest Africa or Innermost Thibet, but to the\r\n\r\nEast End of London, barely a stone\u2019s throw distant from Ludgate\r\n\r\nCircus, you know not the way!\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do it, you know,\u201d said the human emporium\r\n\r\nof routes and fares at Cook\u2019s Cheapside branch. \u201cIt\r\n\r\nis so\u2014hem\u2014so unusual.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cConsult the police,\u201d he concluded authoritatively, when\r\n\r\nI had persisted. \u201cWe are not accustomed to taking travellers\r\n\r\nto the East End; we receive no call to take them there, and we know\r\n\r\nnothing whatsoever about the place at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I interposed, to save myself from\r\n\r\nbeing swept out of the office by his flood of negations. \u201cHere\u2019s\r\n\r\nsomething you can do for me. I wish you to understand in advance\r\n\r\nwhat I intend doing, so that in case of trouble you may be able to identify\r\n\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I see! should you be murdered, we would be in position\r\n\r\nto identify the corpse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe said it so cheerfully and cold-bloodedly that on the instant I\r\n\r\nsaw my stark and mutilated cadaver stretched upon a slab where cool\r\n\r\nwaters trickle ceaselessly, and him I saw bending over and sadly and\r\n\r\npatiently identifying it as the body of the insane American who would\r\n\r\nsee the East End.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d I answered; \u201cmerely to identify me in\r\n\r\ncase I get into a scrape with the \u2019bobbies.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThis last I said with a thrill; truly, I was gripping hold of the vernacular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis a matter for the consideration\r\n\r\nof the Chief Office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is so unprecedented, you know,\u201d he added apologetically.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man at the Chief Office hemmed and hawed. \u201cWe make\r\n\r\nit a rule,\u201d he explained, \u201cto give no information concerning\r\n\r\nour clients.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut in this case,\u201d I urged, \u201cit is the client\r\n\r\nwho requests you to give the information concerning himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain he hemmed and hawed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I hastily anticipated, \u201cI know it\r\n\r\nis unprecedented, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I was about to remark,\u201d he went on steadily, \u201cit\r\n\r\nis unprecedented, and I don\u2019t think we can do anything for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I departed with the address of a detective who lived in\r\n\r\nthe East End, and took my way to the American consul-general.\r\n\r\nAnd here, at last, I found a man with whom I could \u201cdo business.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no hemming and hawing, no lifted brows, open incredulity,\r\n\r\nor blank amazement. In one minute I explained myself and my project,\r\n\r\nwhich he accepted as a matter of course. In the second minute\r\n\r\nhe asked my age, height, and weight, and looked me over. And in\r\n\r\nthe third minute, as we shook hands at parting, he said: \u201cAll\r\n\r\nright, Jack. I\u2019ll remember you and keep track.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI breathed a sigh of relief. Having burnt my ships behind me,\r\n\r\nI was now free to plunge into that human wilderness of which nobody\r\n\r\nseemed to know anything. But at once I encountered a new difficulty\r\n\r\nin the shape of my cabby, a grey-whiskered and eminently decorous personage\r\n\r\nwho had imperturbably driven me for several hours about the \u201cCity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDrive me down to the East End,\u201d I ordered, taking my\r\n\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, sir?\u201d he demanded with frank surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the East End, anywhere. Go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hansom pursued an aimless way for several minutes, then came\r\n\r\nto a puzzled stop. The aperture above my head was uncovered, and\r\n\r\nthe cabman peered down perplexedly at me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d he said, \u201cwot plyce yer wanter go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cEast End,\u201d I repeated. \u201cNowhere in particular.\r\n\r\nJust drive me around anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut wot\u2019s the haddress, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here!\u201d I thundered. \u201cDrive me down to\r\n\r\nthe East End, and at once!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he did not understand, but he withdrew his head,\r\n\r\nand grumblingly started his horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere in the streets of London may one escape the sight of abject\r\n\r\npoverty, while five minutes\u2019 walk from almost any point will bring\r\n\r\none to a slum; but the region my hansom was now penetrating was one\r\n\r\nunending slum. The streets were filled with a new and different\r\n\r\nrace of people, short of stature, and of wretched or beer-sodden appearance.\r\n\r\nWe rolled along through miles of bricks and squalor, and from each cross\r\n\r\nstreet and alley flashed long vistas of bricks and misery. Here\r\n\r\nand there lurched a drunken man or woman, and the air was obscene with\r\n\r\nsounds of jangling and squabbling. At a market, tottery old men\r\n\r\nand women were searching in the garbage thrown in the mud for rotten\r\n\r\npotatoes, beans, and vegetables, while little children clustered like\r\n\r\nflies around a festering mass of fruit, thrusting their arms to the\r\n\r\nshoulders into the liquid corruption, and drawing forth morsels but\r\n\r\npartially decayed, which they devoured on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a hansom did I meet with in all my drive, while mine was like\r\n\r\nan apparition from another and better world, the way the children ran\r\n\r\nafter it and alongside. And as far as I could see were the solid\r\n\r\nwalls of brick, the slimy pavements, and the screaming streets; and\r\n\r\nfor the first time in my life the fear of the crowd smote me.\r\n\r\nIt was like the fear of the sea; and the miserable multitudes, street\r\n\r\nupon street, seemed so many waves of a vast and malodorous sea, lapping\r\n\r\nabout me and threatening to well up and over me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cStepney, sir; Stepney Station,\u201d the cabby called down.\r\n\r\n\r\nI looked about. It was really a railroad station, and he had\r\n\r\ndriven desperately to it as the one familiar spot he had ever heard\r\n\r\nof in all that wilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe spluttered unintelligibly, shook his head, and looked very miserable.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a strynger \u2019ere,\u201d he managed to articulate.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 if yer don\u2019t want Stepney Station, I\u2019m\r\n\r\nblessed if I know wotcher do want.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I want,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\r\n\r\ndrive along and keep your eye out for a shop where old clothes are sold.\r\n\r\nNow, when you see such a shop, drive right on till you turn the corner,\r\n\r\nthen stop and let me out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI could see that he was growing dubious of his fare, but not long\r\n\r\nafterwards he pulled up to the curb and informed me that an old-clothes\r\n\r\nshop was to be found a bit of the way back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019tcher py me?\u201d he pleaded. \u201cThere\u2019s\r\n\r\nseven an\u2019 six owin\u2019 me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I laughed, \u201cand it would be the last I\u2019d\r\n\r\nsee of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cLord lumme, but it\u2019ll be the last I see of you if yer\r\n\r\ndon\u2019t py me,\u201d he retorted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a crowd of ragged onlookers had already gathered around the cab,\r\n\r\nand I laughed again and walked back to the old-clothes shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the chief difficulty was in making the shopman understand that\r\n\r\nI really and truly wanted old clothes. But after fruitless attempts\r\n\r\nto press upon me new and impossible coats and trousers, he began to\r\n\r\nbring to light heaps of old ones, looking mysterious the while and hinting\r\n\r\ndarkly. This he did with the palpable intention of letting me\r\n\r\nknow that he had \u201cpiped my lay,\u201d in order to bulldose me,\r\n\r\nthrough fear of exposure, into paying heavily for my purchases.\r\n\r\nA man in trouble, or a high-class criminal from across the water, was\r\n\r\nwhat he took my measure for\u2014in either case, a person anxious to\r\n\r\navoid the police.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I disputed with him over the outrageous difference between prices\r\n\r\nand values, till I quite disabused him of the notion, and he settled\r\n\r\ndown to drive a hard bargain with a hard customer. In the end\r\n\r\nI selected a pair of stout though well-worn trousers, a frayed jacket\r\n\r\nwith one remaining button, a pair of brogans which had plainly seen\r\n\r\nservice where coal was shovelled, a thin leather belt, and a very dirty\r\n\r\ncloth cap. My underclothing and socks, however, were new and warm,\r\n\r\nbut of the sort that any American waif, down in his luck, could acquire\r\n\r\nin the ordinary course of events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI must sy yer a sharp \u2019un,\u201d he said, with counterfeit\r\n\r\nadmiration, as I handed over the ten shillings finally agreed upon for\r\n\r\nthe outfit. \u201cBlimey, if you ain\u2019t ben up an\u2019\r\n\r\ndown Petticut Lane afore now. Yer trouseys is wuth five bob to\r\n\r\nhany man, an\u2019 a docker \u2019ud give two an\u2019 six for the\r\n\r\nshoes, to sy nothin\u2019 of the coat an\u2019 cap an\u2019 new stoker\u2019s\r\n\r\nsinglet an\u2019 hother things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHow much will you give me for them?\u201d I demanded suddenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI paid you ten bob for the lot, and I\u2019ll sell them back\r\n\r\nto you, right now, for eight! Come, it\u2019s a go!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he grinned and shook his head, and though I had made a good bargain,\r\n\r\nI was unpleasantly aware that he had made a better one.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found the cabby and a policeman with their heads together, but\r\n\r\nthe latter, after looking me over sharply, and particularly scrutinizing\r\n\r\nthe bundle under my arm, turned away and left the cabby to wax mutinous\r\n\r\nby himself. And not a step would he budge till I paid him the\r\n\r\nseven shillings and sixpence owing him. Whereupon he was willing\r\n\r\nto drive me to the ends of the earth, apologising profusely for his\r\n\r\ninsistence, and explaining that one ran across queer customers in London\r\n\r\nTown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he drove me only to Highbury Vale, in North London, where my\r\n\r\nluggage was waiting for me. Here, next day, I took off my shoes\r\n\r\n(not without regret for their lightness and comfort), and my soft, grey\r\n\r\ntravelling suit, and, in fact, all my clothing; and proceeded to array\r\n\r\nmyself in the clothes of the other and unimaginable men, who must have\r\n\r\nbeen indeed unfortunate to have had to part with such rags for the pitiable\r\n\r\nsums obtainable from a dealer.\r\n\r\n\r\nInside my stoker\u2019s singlet, in the armpit, I sewed a gold sovereign\r\n\r\n(an emergency sum certainly of modest proportions); and inside my stoker\u2019s\r\n\r\nsinglet I put myself. And then I sat down and moralised upon the\r\n\r\nfair years and fat, which had made my skin soft and brought the nerves\r\n\r\nclose to the surface; for the singlet was rough and raspy as a hair\r\n\r\nshirt, and I am confident that the most rigorous of ascetics suffer\r\n\r\nno more than I did in the ensuing twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remainder of my costume was fairly easy to put on, though the brogans, or\r\n\r\nbrogues, were quite a problem. As stiff and hard as if made of wood, it was\r\n\r\nonly after a prolonged pounding of the uppers with my fists that I was able to\r\n\r\nget my feet into them at all. Then, with a few shillings, a knife, a\r\n\r\nhandkerchief, and some brown papers and flake tobacco stowed away in my\r\n\r\npockets, I thumped down the stairs and said good-bye to my foreboding friends.\r\n\r\nAs I passed out of the door, the \u201chelp,\u201d a comely middle-aged\r\n\r\nwoman, could not conquer a grin that twisted her lips and separated them till\r\n\r\nthe throat, out of involuntary sympathy, made the uncouth animal noises we are\r\n\r\nwont to designate as \u201claughter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner was I out on the streets than I was impressed by the difference\r\n\r\nin status effected by my clothes. All servility vanished from\r\n\r\nthe demeanour of the common people with whom I came in contact.\r\n\r\nPresto! in the twinkling of an eye, so to say, I had become one of them.\r\n\r\nMy frayed and out-at-elbows jacket was the badge and advertisement of\r\n\r\nmy class, which was their class. It made me of like kind, and\r\n\r\nin place of the fawning and too respectful attention I had hitherto\r\n\r\nreceived, I now shared with them a comradeship. The man in corduroy\r\n\r\nand dirty neckerchief no longer addressed me as \u201csir\u201d or\r\n\r\n\u201cgovernor.\u201d It was \u201cmate\u201d now\u2014and\r\n\r\na fine and hearty word, with a tingle to it, and a warmth and gladness,\r\n\r\nwhich the other term does not possess. Governor! It smacks\r\n\r\nof mastery, and power, and high authority\u2014the tribute of the man\r\n\r\nwho is under to the man on top, delivered in the hope that he will let\r\n\r\nup a bit and ease his weight, which is another way of saying that it\r\n\r\nis an appeal for alms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brings me to a delight I experienced in my rags and tatters\r\n\r\nwhich is denied the average American abroad. The European traveller\r\n\r\nfrom the States, who is not a Croesus, speedily finds himself reduced\r\n\r\nto a chronic state of self-conscious sordidness by the hordes of cringing\r\n\r\nrobbers who clutter his steps from dawn till dark, and deplete his pocket-book\r\n\r\nin a way that puts compound interest to the blush.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my rags and tatters I escaped the pestilence of tipping, and encountered\r\n\r\nmen on a basis of equality. Nay, before the day was out I turned\r\n\r\nthe tables, and said, most gratefully, \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d\r\n\r\nto a gentleman whose horse I held, and who dropped a penny into my eager\r\n\r\npalm.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther changes I discovered were wrought in my condition by my new\r\n\r\ngarb. In crossing crowded thoroughfares I found I had to be, if\r\n\r\nanything, more lively in avoiding vehicles, and it was strikingly impressed\r\n\r\nupon me that my life had cheapened in direct ratio with my clothes.\r\n\r\nWhen before I inquired the way of a policeman, I was usually asked,\r\n\r\n\u201cBus or \u2019ansom, sir?\u201d But now the query became,\r\n\r\n\u201cWalk or ride?\u201d Also, at the railway stations, a third-class\r\n\r\nticket was now shoved out to me as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there was compensation for it all. For the first time I\r\n\r\nmet the English lower classes face to face, and knew them for what they\r\n\r\nwere. When loungers and workmen, at street corners and in public-houses,\r\n\r\ntalked with me, they talked as one man to another, and they talked as\r\n\r\nnatural men should talk, without the least idea of getting anything\r\n\r\nout of me for what they talked or the way they talked.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when at last I made into the East End, I was gratified to find\r\n\r\nthat the fear of the crowd no longer haunted me. I had become\r\n\r\na part of it. The vast and malodorous sea had welled up and over\r\n\r\nme, or I had slipped gently into it, and there was nothing fearsome\r\n\r\nabout it\u2014with the one exception of the stoker\u2019s singlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nJOHNNY UPRIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not give you the address of Johnny Upright. Let it\r\n\r\nsuffice that he lives in the most respectable street in the East End\u2014a\r\n\r\nstreet that would be considered very mean in America, but a veritable\r\n\r\noasis in the desert of East London. It is surrounded on every\r\n\r\nside by close-packed squalor and streets jammed by a young and vile\r\n\r\nand dirty generation; but its own pavements are comparatively bare of\r\n\r\nthe children who have no other place to play, while it has an air of\r\n\r\ndesertion, so few are the people that come and go.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach house in this street, as in all the streets, is shoulder to\r\n\r\nshoulder with its neighbours. To each house there is but one entrance,\r\n\r\nthe front door; and each house is about eighteen feet wide, with a bit\r\n\r\nof a brick-walled yard behind, where, when it is not raining, one may\r\n\r\nlook at a slate-coloured sky. But it must be understood that this\r\n\r\nis East End opulence we are now considering. Some of the people\r\n\r\nin this street are even so well-to-do as to keep a \u201cslavey.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohnny Upright keeps one, as I well know, she being my first acquaintance\r\n\r\nin this particular portion of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Johnny Upright\u2019s house I came, and to the door came the\r\n\r\n\u201cslavey.\u201d Now, mark you, her position in life was\r\n\r\npitiable and contemptible, but it was with pity and contempt that she\r\n\r\nlooked at me. She evinced a plain desire that our conversation\r\n\r\nshould be short. It was Sunday, and Johnny Upright was not at\r\n\r\nhome, and that was all there was to it. But I lingered, discussing\r\n\r\nwhether or not it was all there was to it, till Mrs. Johnny Upright\r\n\r\nwas attracted to the door, where she scolded the girl for not having\r\n\r\nclosed it before turning her attention to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, Mr. Johnny Upright was not at home, and further, he saw nobody\r\n\r\non Sunday. It is too bad, said I. Was I looking for work?\r\n\r\nNo, quite the contrary; in fact, I had come to see Johnny Upright on\r\n\r\nbusiness which might be profitable to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA change came over the face of things at once. The gentleman\r\n\r\nin question was at church, but would be home in an hour or thereabouts,\r\n\r\nwhen no doubt he could be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould I kindly step in?\u2014no, the lady did not ask me, though\r\n\r\nI fished for an invitation by stating that I would go down to the corner\r\n\r\nand wait in a public-house. And down to the corner I went, but,\r\n\r\nit being church time, the \u201cpub\u201d was closed. A miserable\r\n\r\ndrizzle was falling, and, in lieu of better, I took a seat on a neighbourly\r\n\r\ndoorstep and waited.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here to the doorstep came the \u201cslavey,\u201d very frowzy\r\n\r\nand very perplexed, to tell me that the missus would let me come back\r\n\r\nand wait in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cSo many people come \u2019ere lookin\u2019 for work,\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Johnny Upright apologetically explained. \u201cSo I \u2019ope\r\n\r\nyou won\u2019t feel bad the way I spoke.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, not at all,\u201d I replied in my grandest manner,\r\n\r\nfor the nonce investing my rags with dignity. \u201cI quite understand,\r\n\r\nI assure you. I suppose people looking for work almost worry you\r\n\r\nto death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat they do,\u201d she answered, with an eloquent and expressive\r\n\r\nglance; and thereupon ushered me into, not the kitchen, but the dining\r\n\r\nroom\u2014a favour, I took it, in recompense for my grand manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dining-room, on the same floor as the kitchen, was about four\r\n\r\nfeet below the level of the ground, and so dark (it was midday) that\r\n\r\nI had to wait a space for my eyes to adjust themselves to the gloom.\r\n\r\nDirty light filtered in through a window, the top of which was on a\r\n\r\nlevel with a sidewalk, and in this light I found that I was able to\r\n\r\nread newspaper print.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here, while waiting the coming of Johnny Upright, let me explain my errand.\r\n\r\nWhile living, eating, and sleeping with the people of the East End, it was my\r\n\r\nintention to have a port of refuge, not too far distant, into which I could run\r\n\r\nnow and again to assure myself that good clothes and cleanliness still existed.\r\n\r\nAlso in such port I could receive my mail, work up my notes, and sally forth\r\n\r\noccasionally in changed garb to civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this involved a dilemma. A lodging where my property would\r\n\r\nbe safe implied a landlady apt to be suspicious of a gentleman leading\r\n\r\na double life; while a landlady who would not bother her head over the\r\n\r\ndouble life of her lodgers would imply lodgings where property was unsafe.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the dilemma was what had brought me to Johnny Upright.\r\n\r\nA detective of thirty-odd years\u2019 continuous service in the East\r\n\r\nEnd, known far and wide by a name given him by a convicted felon in\r\n\r\nthe dock, he was just the man to find me an honest landlady, and make\r\n\r\nher rest easy concerning the strange comings and goings of which I might\r\n\r\nbe guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis two daughters beat him home from church\u2014and pretty girls\r\n\r\nthey were in their Sunday dresses; withal it was the certain weak and\r\n\r\ndelicate prettiness which characterises the Cockney lasses, a prettiness\r\n\r\nwhich is no more than a promise with no grip on time, and doomed to\r\n\r\nfade quickly away like the colour from a sunset sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey looked me over with frank curiosity, as though I were some sort\r\n\r\nof a strange animal, and then ignored me utterly for the rest of my\r\n\r\nwait. Then Johnny Upright himself arrived, and I was summoned\r\n\r\nupstairs to confer with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak loud,\u201d he interrupted my opening words.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a bad cold, and I can\u2019t hear well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nShades of Old Sleuth and Sherlock Holmes! I wondered as to\r\n\r\nwhere the assistant was located whose duty it was to take down whatever\r\n\r\ninformation I might loudly vouchsafe. And to this day, much as\r\n\r\nI have seen of Johnny Upright and much as I have puzzled over the incident,\r\n\r\nI have never been quite able to make up my mind as to whether or not\r\n\r\nhe had a cold, or had an assistant planted in the other room.\r\n\r\nBut of one thing I am sure: though I gave Johnny Upright the facts concerning\r\n\r\nmyself and project, he withheld judgment till next day, when I dodged\r\n\r\ninto his street conventionally garbed and in a hansom. Then his\r\n\r\ngreeting was cordial enough, and I went down into the dining-room to\r\n\r\njoin the family at tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are humble here,\u201d he said, \u201cnot given to the\r\n\r\nflesh, and you must take us for what we are, in our humble way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girls were flushed and embarrassed at greeting me, while he did\r\n\r\nnot make it any the easier for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d he roared heartily, slapping the table with\r\n\r\nhis open hand till the dishes rang. \u201cThe girls thought yesterday\r\n\r\nyou had come to ask for a piece of bread! Ha! ha! ho! ho! ho!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis they indignantly denied, with snapping eyes and guilty red cheeks,\r\n\r\nas though it were an essential of true refinement to be able to discern\r\n\r\nunder his rags a man who had no need to go ragged.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, while I ate bread and marmalade, proceeded a play at cross\r\n\r\npurposes, the daughters deeming it an insult to me that I should have\r\n\r\nbeen mistaken for a beggar, and the father considering it as the highest\r\n\r\ncompliment to my cleverness to succeed in being so mistaken. All\r\n\r\nof which I enjoyed, and the bread, the marmalade, and the tea, till\r\n\r\nthe time came for Johnny Upright to find me a lodging, which he did,\r\n\r\nnot half-a-dozen doors away, in his own respectable and opulent street,\r\n\r\nin a house as like to his own as a pea to its mate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMY LODGING AND SOME OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom an East London standpoint, the room I rented for six shillings,\r\n\r\nor a dollar and a half, per week, was a most comfortable affair.\r\n\r\nFrom the American standpoint, on the other hand, it was rudely furnished,\r\n\r\nuncomfortable, and small. By the time I had added an ordinary\r\n\r\ntypewriter table to its scanty furnishing, I was hard put to turn around;\r\n\r\nat the best, I managed to navigate it by a sort of vermicular progression\r\n\r\nrequiring great dexterity and presence of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving settled myself, or my property rather, I put on my knockabout\r\n\r\nclothes and went out for a walk. Lodgings being fresh in my mind,\r\n\r\nI began to look them up, bearing in mind the hypothesis that I was a\r\n\r\npoor young man with a wife and large family.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first discovery was that empty houses were few and far between\u2014so\r\n\r\nfar between, in fact, that though I walked miles in irregular circles\r\n\r\nover a large area, I still remained between. Not one empty house\r\n\r\ncould I find\u2014a conclusive proof that the district was \u201csaturated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt being plain that as a poor young man with a family I could rent\r\n\r\nno houses at all in this most undesirable region, I next looked for\r\n\r\nrooms, unfurnished rooms, in which I could store my wife and babies\r\n\r\nand chattels. There were not many, but I found them, usually in\r\n\r\nthe singular, for one appears to be considered sufficient for a poor\r\n\r\nman\u2019s family in which to cook and eat and sleep. When I\r\n\r\nasked for two rooms, the sublettees looked at me very much in the manner,\r\n\r\nI imagine, that a certain personage looked at Oliver Twist when he asked\r\n\r\nfor more.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only was one room deemed sufficient for a poor man and his family,\r\n\r\nbut I learned that many families, occupying single rooms, had so much\r\n\r\nspace to spare as to be able to take in a lodger or two. When\r\n\r\nsuch rooms can be rented for from three to six shillings per week, it\r\n\r\nis a fair conclusion that a lodger with references should obtain floor\r\n\r\nspace for, say, from eightpence to a shilling. He may even be\r\n\r\nable to board with the sublettees for a few shillings more. This,\r\n\r\nhowever, I failed to inquire into\u2014a reprehensible error on my\r\n\r\npart, considering that I was working on the basis of a hypothetical\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only did the houses I investigated have no bath-tubs, but I learned\r\n\r\nthat there were no bath-tubs in all the thousands of houses I had seen.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, with my wife and babies and a couple of lodgers\r\n\r\nsuffering from the too great spaciousness of one room, taking a bath\r\n\r\nin a tin wash-basin would be an unfeasible undertaking. But, it\r\n\r\nseems, the compensation comes in with the saving of soap, so all\u2019s\r\n\r\nwell, and God\u2019s still in heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I rented no rooms, but returned to my own Johnny Upright\u2019s\r\n\r\nstreet. What with my wife, and babies, and lodgers, and the various\r\n\r\ncubby-holes into which I had fitted them, my mind\u2019s eye had become\r\n\r\nnarrow-angled, and I could not quite take in all of my own room at once.\r\n\r\nThe immensity of it was awe-inspiring. Could this be the room\r\n\r\nI had rented for six shillings a week? Impossible! But my\r\n\r\nlandlady, knocking at the door to learn if I were comfortable, dispelled\r\n\r\nmy doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, sir,\u201d she said, in reply to a question.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis street is the very last. All the other streets were\r\n\r\nlike this eight or ten years ago, and all the people were very respectable.\r\n\r\nBut the others have driven our kind out. Those in this street\r\n\r\nare the only ones left. It\u2019s shocking, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then she explained the process of saturation, by which the rental\r\n\r\nvalue of a neighbourhood went up, while its tone went down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, sir, our kind are not used to crowding in the way\r\n\r\nthe others do. We need more room. The others, the foreigners\r\n\r\nand lower-class people, can get five and six families into this house,\r\n\r\nwhere we only get one. So they can pay more rent for the house\r\n\r\nthan we can afford. It is shocking, sir; and just to think,\r\n\r\nonly a few years ago all this neighbourhood was just as nice as it could\r\n\r\nbe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI looked at her. Here was a woman, of the finest grade of the\r\n\r\nEnglish working-class, with numerous evidences of refinement, being\r\n\r\nslowly engulfed by that noisome and rotten tide of humanity which the\r\n\r\npowers that be are pouring eastward out of London Town. Bank,\r\n\r\nfactory, hotel, and office building must go up, and the city poor folk\r\n\r\nare a nomadic breed; so they migrate eastward, wave upon wave, saturating\r\n\r\nand degrading neighbourhood by neighbourhood, driving the better class\r\n\r\nof workers before them to pioneer, on the rim of the city, or dragging\r\n\r\nthem down, if not in the first generation, surely in the second and\r\n\r\nthird.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only a question of months when Johnny Upright\u2019s street\r\n\r\nmust go. He realises it himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a couple of years,\u201d he says, \u201cmy lease expires.\r\n\r\nMy landlord is one of our kind. He has not put up the rent on\r\n\r\nany of his houses here, and this has enabled us to stay. But any\r\n\r\nday he may sell, or any day he may die, which is the same thing so far\r\n\r\nas we are concerned. The house is bought by a money breeder, who\r\n\r\nbuilds a sweat shop on the patch of ground at the rear where my grapevine\r\n\r\nis, adds to the house, and rents it a room to a family. There\r\n\r\nyou are, and Johnny Upright\u2019s gone!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd truly I saw Johnny Upright, and his good wife and fair daughters,\r\n\r\nand frowzy slavey, like so many ghosts flitting eastward through the\r\n\r\ngloom, the monster city roaring at their heels.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Johnny Upright is not alone in his flitting. Far, far out,\r\n\r\non the fringe of the city, live the small business men, little managers,\r\n\r\nand successful clerks. They dwell in cottages and semi-detached\r\n\r\nvillas, with bits of flower garden, and elbow room, and breathing space.\r\n\r\nThey inflate themselves with pride, and throw out their chests when\r\n\r\nthey contemplate the Abyss from which they have escaped, and they thank\r\n\r\nGod that they are not as other men. And lo! down upon them comes\r\n\r\nJohnny Upright and the monster city at his heels. Tenements spring\r\n\r\nup like magic, gardens are built upon, villas are divided and subdivided\r\n\r\ninto many dwellings, and the black night of London settles down in a\r\n\r\ngreasy pall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA MAN AND THE ABYSS\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, can you let a lodging?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThese words I discharged carelessly over my shoulder at a stout and\r\n\r\nelderly woman, of whose fare I was partaking in a greasy coffee-house\r\n\r\ndown near the Pool and not very far from Limehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yus,\u201d she answered shortly, my appearance possibly\r\n\r\nnot approximating the standard of affluence required by her house.\r\n\r\n\r\nI said no more, consuming my rasher of bacon and pint of sickly tea\r\n\r\nin silence. Nor did she take further interest in me till I came\r\n\r\nto pay my reckoning (fourpence), when I pulled all of ten shillings\r\n\r\nout of my pocket. The expected result was produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYus, sir,\u201d she at once volunteered; \u201cI \u2019ave\r\n\r\nnice lodgin\u2019s you\u2019d likely tyke a fancy to. Back from\r\n\r\na voyage, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHow much for a room?\u201d I inquired, ignoring her curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked me up and down with frank surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t\r\n\r\nlet rooms, not to my reg\u2019lar lodgers, much less casuals.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to look along a bit,\u201d I said, with\r\n\r\nmarked disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the sight of my ten shillings had made her keen. \u201cI\r\n\r\ncan let you have a nice bed in with two hother men,\u201d she urged.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood, respectable men, an\u2019 steady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to sleep with two other men,\u201d\r\n\r\nI objected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t \u2019ave to. There\u2019s three beds\r\n\r\nin the room, an\u2019 hit\u2019s not a very small room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHow much?\u201d I demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Arf a crown a week, two an\u2019 six, to a regular\r\n\r\nlodger. You\u2019ll fancy the men, I\u2019m sure. One\r\n\r\nworks in the ware\u2019ouse, an\u2019 \u2019e\u2019s been with me\r\n\r\ntwo years now. An\u2019 the hother\u2019s bin with me six\u2014six\r\n\r\nyears, sir, an\u2019 two months comin\u2019 nex\u2019 Saturday.\r\n\r\n\u2019E\u2019s a scene-shifter,\u201d she went on. \u201cA\r\n\r\nsteady, respectable man, never missin\u2019 a night\u2019s work in\r\n\r\nthe time \u2019e\u2019s bin with me. An\u2019 \u2019e likes\r\n\r\nthe \u2019ouse; \u2019e says as it\u2019s the best \u2019e can do\r\n\r\nin the w\u2019y of lodgin\u2019s. I board \u2019im, an\u2019\r\n\r\nthe hother lodgers too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he\u2019s saving money right along,\u201d I insinuated\r\n\r\ninnocently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBless you, no! Nor can \u2019e do as well helsewhere\r\n\r\nwith \u2019is money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I thought of my own spacious West, with room under its sky and\r\n\r\nunlimited air for a thousand Londons; and here was this man, a steady\r\n\r\nand reliable man, never missing a night\u2019s work, frugal and honest,\r\n\r\nlodging in one room with two other men, paying two dollars and a half\r\n\r\nper month for it, and out of his experience adjudging it to be the best\r\n\r\nhe could do! And here was I, on the strength of the ten shillings\r\n\r\nin my pocket, able to enter in with my rags and take up my bed with\r\n\r\nhim. The human soul is a lonely thing, but it must be very lonely\r\n\r\nsometimes when there are three beds to a room, and casuals with ten\r\n\r\nshillings are admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThirteen years, sir; an\u2019 don\u2019t you think you\u2019ll\r\n\r\nfancy the lodgin\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe while she talked she was shuffling ponderously about the small\r\n\r\nkitchen in which she cooked the food for her lodgers who were also boarders.\r\n\r\nWhen I first entered, she had been hard at work, nor had she let up\r\n\r\nonce throughout the conversation. Undoubtedly she was a busy woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cUp at half-past five,\u201d \u201cto bed the last thing at\r\n\r\nnight,\u201d \u201cworkin\u2019 fit ter drop,\u201d thirteen years\r\n\r\nof it, and for reward, grey hairs, frowzy clothes, stooped shoulders,\r\n\r\nslatternly figure, unending toil in a foul and noisome coffee-house\r\n\r\nthat faced on an alley ten feet between the walls, and a waterside environment\r\n\r\nthat was ugly and sickening, to say the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be hin hagain to \u2019ave a look?\u201d she\r\n\r\nquestioned wistfully, as I went out of the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as I turned and looked at her, I realized to the full the deeper\r\n\r\ntruth underlying that very wise old maxim: \u201cVirtue is its own\r\n\r\nreward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI went back to her. \u201cHave you ever taken a vacation?\u201d\r\n\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cVycytion!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cA trip to the country for a couple of days, fresh air, a day\r\n\r\noff, you know, a rest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cLor\u2019 lumme!\u201d she laughed, for the first time stopping\r\n\r\nfrom her work. \u201cA vycytion, eh? for the likes o\u2019 me?\r\n\r\nJust fancy, now!\u2014Mind yer feet!\u201d\u2014this last sharply,\r\n\r\nand to me, as I stumbled over the rotten threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\nDown near the West India Dock I came upon a young fellow staring\r\n\r\ndisconsolately at the muddy water. A fireman\u2019s cap was pulled\r\n\r\ndown across his eyes, and the fit and sag of his clothes whispered unmistakably\r\n\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHello, mate,\u201d I greeted him, sparring for a beginning.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you tell me the way to Wapping?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWorked yer way over on a cattle boat?\u201d he countered,\r\n\r\nfixing my nationality on the instant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon we entered upon a talk that extended itself to a public-house\r\n\r\nand a couple of pints of \u201carf an\u2019 arf.\u201d This\r\n\r\nled to closer intimacy, so that when I brought to light all of a shilling\u2019s\r\n\r\nworth of coppers (ostensibly my all), and put aside sixpence for a bed,\r\n\r\nand sixpence for more arf an\u2019 arf, he generously proposed that\r\n\r\nwe drink up the whole shilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mate, \u2019e cut up rough las\u2019 night,\u201d he\r\n\r\nexplained. \u201cAn\u2019 the bobbies got \u2019m, so you can\r\n\r\nbunk in wi\u2019 me. Wotcher say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI said yes, and by the time we had soaked ourselves in a whole shilling\u2019s\r\n\r\nworth of beer, and slept the night on a miserable bed in a miserable\r\n\r\nden, I knew him pretty fairly for what he was. And that in one\r\n\r\nrespect he was representative of a large body of the lower-class London\r\n\r\nworkman, my later experience substantiates.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was London-born, his father a fireman and a drinker before him.\r\n\r\nAs a child, his home was the streets and the docks. He had never\r\n\r\nlearned to read, and had never felt the need for it\u2014a vain and\r\n\r\nuseless accomplishment, he held, at least for a man of his station in\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had had a mother and numerous squalling brothers and sisters,\r\n\r\nall crammed into a couple of rooms and living on poorer and less regular\r\n\r\nfood than he could ordinarily rustle for himself. In fact, he\r\n\r\nnever went home except at periods when he was unfortunate in procuring\r\n\r\nhis own food. Petty pilfering and begging along the streets and\r\n\r\ndocks, a trip or two to sea as mess-boy, a few trips more as coal-trimmer,\r\n\r\nand then a full-fledged fireman, he had reached the top of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in the course of this he had also hammered out a philosophy of\r\n\r\nlife, an ugly and repulsive philosophy, but withal a very logical and\r\n\r\nsensible one from his point of view. When I asked him what he\r\n\r\nlived for, he immediately answered, \u201cBooze.\u201d A voyage\r\n\r\nto sea (for a man must live and get the wherewithal), and then the paying\r\n\r\noff and the big drunk at the end. After that, haphazard little\r\n\r\ndrunks, sponged in the \u201cpubs\u201d from mates with a few coppers\r\n\r\nleft, like myself, and when sponging was played out another trip to\r\n\r\nsea and a repetition of the beastly cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut women,\u201d I suggested, when he had finished proclaiming\r\n\r\nbooze the sole end of existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWimmen!\u201d He thumped his pot upon the bar and orated\r\n\r\neloquently. \u201cWimmen is a thing my edication \u2019as learnt\r\n\r\nme t\u2019 let alone. It don\u2019t pay, matey; it don\u2019t\r\n\r\npay. Wot\u2019s a man like me want o\u2019 wimmen, eh? jest\r\n\r\nyou tell me. There was my mar, she was enough, a-bangin\u2019\r\n\r\nthe kids about an\u2019 makin\u2019 the ole man mis\u2019rable when\r\n\r\n\u2019e come \u2019ome, w\u2019ich was seldom, I grant.

Think of it, back from a voyage,\r\n\r\nlittle children climbing on your knee, and the wife happy and smiling,\r\n\r\nand a kiss for you when she lays the table, and a kiss all round from\r\n\r\nthe babies when they go to bed, and the kettle singing and the long\r\n\r\ntalk afterwards of where you\u2019ve been and what you\u2019ve seen,\r\n\r\nand of her and all the little happenings at home while you\u2019ve\r\n\r\nbeen away, and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cGarn!\u201d he cried, with a playful shove of his fist on\r\n\r\nmy shoulder. \u201cWot\u2019s yer game, eh?

Arf an\u2019 arf\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout going further with the speech of this young fellow of two-and-twenty,\r\n\r\nI think I have sufficiently indicated his philosophy of life and the\r\n\r\nunderlying economic reason for it. Home life he had never known.\r\n\r\nThe word \u201chome\u201d aroused nothing but unpleasant associations.\r\n\r\nIn the low wages of his father, and of other men in the same walk in\r\n\r\nlife, he found sufficient reason for branding wife and children as encumbrances\r\n\r\nand causes of masculine misery. An unconscious hedonist, utterly\r\n\r\nunmoral and materialistic, he sought the greatest possible happiness\r\n\r\nfor himself, and found it in drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nA young sot; a premature wreck; physical inability to do a stoker\u2019s\r\n\r\nwork; the gutter or the workhouse; and the end\u2014he saw it all as\r\n\r\nclearly as I, but it held no terrors for him. From the moment\r\n\r\nof his birth, all the forces of his environment had tended to harden\r\n\r\nhim, and he viewed his wretched, inevitable future with a callousness\r\n\r\nand unconcern I could not shake.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet he was not a bad man. He was not inherently vicious\r\n\r\nand brutal. He had normal mentality, and a more than average physique.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were blue and round, shaded by long lashes, and wide apart.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a laugh in them, and a fund of humour behind. The\r\n\r\nbrow and general features were good, the mouth and lips sweet, though\r\n\r\nalready developing a harsh twist. The chin was weak, but not too\r\n\r\nweak; I have seen men sitting in the high places with weaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis head was shapely, and so gracefully was it poised upon a perfect\r\n\r\nneck that I was not surprised by his body that night when he stripped\r\n\r\nfor bed. I have seen many men strip, in gymnasium and training\r\n\r\nquarters, men of good blood and upbringing, but I have never seen one\r\n\r\nwho stripped to better advantage than this young sot of two-and-twenty,\r\n\r\nthis young god doomed to rack and ruin in four or five short years,\r\n\r\nand to pass hence without posterity to receive the splendid heritage\r\n\r\nit was his to bequeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed sacrilege to waste such life, and yet I was forced to confess\r\n\r\nthat he was right in not marrying on four pounds ten in London Town.\r\n\r\nJust as the scene-shifter was happier in making both ends meet in a\r\n\r\nroom shared with two other men, than he would have been had he packed\r\n\r\na feeble family along with a couple of men into a cheaper room, and\r\n\r\nfailed in making both ends meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd day by day I became convinced that not only is it unwise, but\r\n\r\nit is criminal for the people of the Abyss to marry. They are\r\n\r\nthe stones by the builder rejected. There is no place for them,\r\n\r\nin the social fabric, while all the forces of society drive them downward\r\n\r\ntill they perish. At the bottom of the Abyss they are feeble,\r\n\r\nbesotted, and imbecile. If they reproduce, the life is so cheap\r\n\r\nthat perforce it perishes of itself. The work of the world goes\r\n\r\non above them, and they do not care to take part in it, nor are they\r\n\r\nable. Moreover, the work of the world does not need them.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty, far fitter than they, clinging to the steep slope\r\n\r\nabove, and struggling frantically to slide no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, the London Abyss is a vast shambles. Year by year,\r\n\r\nand decade after decade, rural England pours in a flood of vigorous\r\n\r\nstrong life, that not only does not renew itself, but perishes by the\r\n\r\nthird generation. Competent authorities aver that the London workman\r\n\r\nwhose parents and grand-parents were born in London is so remarkable\r\n\r\na specimen that he is rarely found.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. A. C. Pigou has said that the aged poor, and the residuum which\r\n\r\ncompose the \u201csubmerged tenth,\u201d constitute 71 per cent, of\r\n\r\nthe population of London. Which is to say that last year, and\r\n\r\nyesterday, and to-day, at this very moment, 450,000 of these creatures\r\n\r\nare dying miserably at the bottom of the social pit called \u201cLondon.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs to how they die, I shall take an instance from this morning\u2019s\r\n\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-NEGLECT\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday Dr. Wynn Westcott held an inquest at Shoreditch, respecting the death\r\n\r\nof Elizabeth Crews, aged 77 years, of 32 East Street, Holborn, who died on\r\n\r\nWednesday last. Alice Mathieson stated that she was landlady of the house where\r\n\r\ndeceased lived. Witness last saw her alive on the previous Monday. She lived\r\n\r\nquite alone. Mr. Francis Birch, relieving officer for the Holborn district,\r\n\r\nstated that deceased had occupied the room in question for thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nWhen witness was called, on the 1st, he found the old woman in a terrible\r\n\r\nstate, and the ambulance and coachman had to be disinfected after the removal.\r\n\r\nDr. Chase Fennell said death was due to blood-poisoning from bed-sores, due to\r\n\r\nself-neglect and filthy surroundings, and the jury returned a verdict to that\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most startling thing about this little incident of a woman\u2019s\r\n\r\ndeath is the smug complacency with which the officials looked upon it\r\n\r\nand rendered judgment. That an old woman of seventy-seven years\r\n\r\nof age should die of SELF-NEGLECT is the most optimistic way possible\r\n\r\nof looking at it. It was the old dead woman\u2019s fault that\r\n\r\nshe died, and having located the responsibility, society goes contentedly\r\n\r\non about its own affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the \u201csubmerged tenth\u201d Mr. Pigou has said: \u201cEither\r\n\r\nthrough lack of bodily strength, or of intelligence, or of fibre, or\r\n\r\nof all three, they are inefficient or unwilling workers, and consequently\r\n\r\nunable to support themselves . . . They are often so degraded in intellect\r\n\r\nas to be incapable of distinguishing their right from their left hand,\r\n\r\nor of recognising the numbers of their own houses; their bodies are\r\n\r\nfeeble and without stamina, their affections are warped, and they scarcely\r\n\r\nknow what family life means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty thousand is a whole lot of people. The\r\n\r\nyoung fireman was only one, and it took him some time to say his little\r\n\r\nsay. I should not like to hear them all talk at once. I\r\n\r\nwonder if God hears them?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHOSE ON THE EDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first impression of East London was naturally a general one.\r\n\r\nLater the details began to appear, and here and there in the chaos of\r\n\r\nmisery I found little spots where a fair measure of happiness reigned\u2014sometimes\r\n\r\nwhole rows of houses in little out-of-the-way streets, where artisans\r\n\r\ndwell and where a rude sort of family life obtains. In the evenings\r\n\r\nthe men can be seen at the doors, pipes in their mouths and children\r\n\r\non their knees, wives gossiping, and laughter and fun going on.\r\n\r\nThe content of these people is manifestly great, for, relative to the\r\n\r\nwretchedness that encompasses them, they are well off.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut at the best, it is a dull, animal happiness, the content of the\r\n\r\nfull belly. The dominant note of their lives is materialistic.\r\n\r\nThey are stupid and heavy, without imagination. The Abyss seems\r\n\r\nto exude a stupefying atmosphere of torpor, which wraps about them and\r\n\r\ndeadens them. Religion passes them by. The Unseen holds\r\n\r\nfor them neither terror nor delight. They are unaware of the Unseen;\r\n\r\nand the full belly and the evening pipe, with their regular \u201carf\r\n\r\nan\u2019 arf,\u201d is all they demand, or dream of demanding, from\r\n\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would not be so bad if it were all; but it is not all.\r\n\r\nThe satisfied torpor in which they are sunk is the deadly inertia that\r\n\r\nprecedes dissolution. There is no progress, and with them not\r\n\r\nto progress is to fall back and into the Abyss. In their own lives\r\n\r\nthey may only start to fall, leaving the fall to be completed by their\r\n\r\nchildren and their children\u2019s children. Man always gets\r\n\r\nless than he demands from life; and so little do they demand, that the\r\n\r\nless than little they get cannot save them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the best, city life is an unnatural life for the human; but the\r\n\r\ncity life of London is so utterly unnatural that the average workman\r\n\r\nor workwoman cannot stand it. Mind and body are sapped by the\r\n\r\nundermining influences ceaselessly at work. Moral and physical\r\n\r\nstamina are broken, and the good workman, fresh from the soil, becomes\r\n\r\nin the first city generation a poor workman; and by the second city\r\n\r\ngeneration, devoid of push and go and initiative, and actually unable\r\n\r\nphysically to perform the labour his father did, he is well on the way\r\n\r\nto the shambles at the bottom of the Abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, the air he breathes, and from which he never escapes,\r\n\r\nis sufficient to weaken him mentally and physically, so that he becomes\r\n\r\nunable to compete with the fresh virile life from the country hastening\r\n\r\non to London Town to destroy and be destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving out the disease germs that fill the air of the East End,\r\n\r\nconsider but the one item of smoke. Sir William Thiselton-Dyer,\r\n\r\ncurator of Kew Gardens, has been studying smoke deposits on vegetation,\r\n\r\nand, according to his calculations, no less than six tons of solid matter,\r\n\r\nconsisting of soot and tarry hydrocarbons, are deposited every week\r\n\r\non every quarter of a square mile in and about London. This is\r\n\r\nequivalent to twenty-four tons per week to the square mile, or 1248\r\n\r\ntons per year to the square mile. From the cornice below the dome\r\n\r\nof St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral was recently taken a solid deposit of\r\n\r\ncrystallised sulphate of lime. This deposit had been formed by\r\n\r\nthe action of the sulphuric acid in the atmosphere upon the carbonate\r\n\r\nof lime in the stone. And this sulphuric acid in the atmosphere\r\n\r\nis constantly being breathed by the London workmen through all the days\r\n\r\nand nights of their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is incontrovertible that the children grow up into rotten adults,\r\n\r\nwithout virility or stamina, a weak-kneed, narrow-chested, listless\r\n\r\nbreed, that crumples up and goes down in the brute struggle for life\r\n\r\nwith the invading hordes from the country. The railway men, carriers,\r\n\r\nomnibus drivers, corn and timber porters, and all those who require\r\n\r\nphysical stamina, are largely drawn from the country; while in the Metropolitan\r\n\r\nPolice there are, roughly, 12,000 country-born as against 3000 London-born.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo one is forced to conclude that the Abyss is literally a huge man-killing\r\n\r\nmachine, and when I pass along the little out-of-the-way streets with\r\n\r\nthe full-bellied artisans at the doors, I am aware of a greater sorrow\r\n\r\nfor them than for the 450,000 lost and hopeless wretches dying at the\r\n\r\nbottom of the pit. They, at least, are dying, that is the point;\r\n\r\nwhile these have yet to go through the slow and preliminary pangs extending\r\n\r\nthrough two and even three generations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet the quality of the life is good. All human potentialities\r\n\r\nare in it. Given proper conditions, it could live through the\r\n\r\ncenturies, and great men, heroes and masters, spring from it and make\r\n\r\nthe world better by having lived.\r\n\r\n\r\nI talked with a woman who was representative of that type which has\r\n\r\nbeen jerked out of its little out-of-the-way streets and has started\r\n\r\non the fatal fall to the bottom. Her husband was a fitter and\r\n\r\na member of the Engineers\u2019 Union. That he was a poor engineer\r\n\r\nwas evidenced by his inability to get regular employment. He did\r\n\r\nnot have the energy and enterprise necessary to obtain or hold a steady\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pair had two daughters, and the four of them lived in a couple\r\n\r\nof holes, called \u201crooms\u201d by courtesy, for which they paid\r\n\r\nseven shillings per week. They possessed no stove, managing their\r\n\r\ncooking on a single gas-ring in the fireplace. Not being persons\r\n\r\nof property, they were unable to obtain an unlimited supply of gas;\r\n\r\nbut a clever machine had been installed for their benefit. By\r\n\r\ndropping a penny in the slot, the gas was forthcoming, and when a penny\u2019s\r\n\r\nworth had forthcome the supply was automatically shut off. \u201cA\r\n\r\npenny gawn in no time,\u201d she explained, \u201can\u2019 the cookin\u2019\r\n\r\nnot arf done!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIncipient starvation had been their portion for years. Month\r\n\r\nin and month out, they had arisen from the table able and willing to\r\n\r\neat more. And when once on the downward slope, chronic innutrition\r\n\r\nis an important factor in sapping vitality and hastening the descent.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet this woman was a hard worker. From 4.30 in the morning\r\n\r\ntill the last light at night, she said, she had toiled at making cloth\r\n\r\ndress-skirts, lined up and with two flounces, for seven shillings a\r\n\r\ndozen. Cloth dress-skirts, mark you, lined up with two flounces,\r\n\r\nfor seven shillings a dozen! This is equal to $1.75 per dozen,\r\n\r\nor 14.75 cents per skirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe husband, in order to obtain employment, had to belong to the\r\n\r\nunion, which collected one shilling and sixpence from him each week.\r\n\r\nAlso, when strikes were afoot and he chanced to be working, he had at\r\n\r\ntimes been compelled to pay as high as seventeen shillings into the\r\n\r\nunion\u2019s coffers for the relief fund.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne daughter, the elder, had worked as green hand for a dressmaker,\r\n\r\nfor one shilling and sixpence per week\u201437.5 cents per week, or\r\n\r\na fraction over 5 cents per day. However, when the slack season\r\n\r\ncame she was discharged, though she had been taken on at such low pay\r\n\r\nwith the understanding that she was to learn the trade and work up.\r\n\r\nAfter that she had been employed in a bicycle store for three years,\r\n\r\nfor which she received five shillings per week, walking two miles to\r\n\r\nher work, and two back, and being fined for tardiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as the man and woman were concerned, the game was played.\r\n\r\nThey had lost handhold and foothold, and were falling into the pit.\r\n\r\nBut what of the daughters? Living like swine, enfeebled by chronic\r\n\r\ninnutrition, being sapped mentally, morally, and physically, what chance\r\n\r\nhave they to crawl up and out of the Abyss into which they were born\r\n\r\nfalling?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I write this, and for an hour past, the air has been made hideous\r\n\r\nby a free-for-all, rough-and-tumble fight going on in the yard that\r\n\r\nis back to back with my yard. When the first sounds reached me\r\n\r\nI took it for the barking and snarling of dogs, and some minutes were\r\n\r\nrequired to convince me that human beings, and women at that, could\r\n\r\nproduce such a fearful clamour.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrunken women fighting! It is not nice to think of; it is far\r\n\r\nworse to listen to. Something like this it runs\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nIncoherent babble, shrieked at the top of the lungs of several women;\r\n\r\na lull, in which is heard a child crying and a young girl\u2019s voice\r\n\r\npleading tearfully; a woman\u2019s voice rises, harsh and grating,\r\n\r\n\u201cYou \u2019it me! Jest you \u2019it me!\u201d then, swat!\r\n\r\nchallenge accepted and fight rages afresh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe back windows of the houses commanding the scene are lined with\r\n\r\nenthusiastic spectators, and the sound of blows, and of oaths that make\r\n\r\none\u2019s blood run cold, are borne to my ears. Happily, I cannot\r\n\r\nsee the combatants.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lull; \u201cYou let that child alone!\u201d child, evidently\r\n\r\nof few years, screaming in downright terror. \u201cAwright,\u201d\r\n\r\nrepeated insistently and at top pitch twenty times straight running;\r\n\r\n\u201cyou\u2019ll git this rock on the \u2019ead!\u201d and then\r\n\r\nrock evidently on the head from the shriek that goes up.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lull; apparently one combatant temporarily disabled and being resuscitated;\r\n\r\nchild\u2019s voice audible again, but now sunk to a lower note of terror\r\n\r\nand growing exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nVoices begin to go up the scale, something like this:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nSufficient affirmation on both sides, conflict again precipitated.\r\n\r\nOne combatant gets overwhelming advantage, and follows it up from the\r\n\r\nway the other combatant screams bloody murder. Bloody murder gurgles\r\n\r\nand dies out, undoubtedly throttled by a strangle hold.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntrance of new voices; a flank attack; strangle hold suddenly broken\r\n\r\nfrom the way bloody murder goes up half an octave higher than before;\r\n\r\ngeneral hullaballoo, everybody fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nLull; new voice, young girl\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019\r\n\r\nter tyke my mother\u2019s part;\u201d dialogue, repeated about five\r\n\r\ntimes, \u201cI\u2019ll do as I like, blankety, blank, blank!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like ter see yer, blankety, blank, blank!\u201d renewed\r\n\r\nconflict, mothers, daughters, everybody, during which my landlady calls\r\n\r\nher young daughter in from the back steps, while I wonder what will\r\n\r\nbe the effect of all that she has heard upon her moral fibre.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFRYING-PAN ALLEY AND A GLIMPSE OF INFERNO\r\n\r\n\r\nThree of us walked down Mile End Road, and one was a hero.\r\n\r\nHe was a slender lad of nineteen, so slight and frail, in fact, that,\r\n\r\nlike Fra Lippo Lippi, a puff of wind might double him up and turn him\r\n\r\nover. He was a burning young socialist, in the first throes of\r\n\r\nenthusiasm and ripe for martyrdom. As platform speaker or chairman\r\n\r\nhe had taken an active and dangerous part in the many indoor and outdoor\r\n\r\npro-Boer meetings which have vexed the serenity of Merry England these\r\n\r\nseveral years back. Little items he had been imparting to me as\r\n\r\nhe walked along; of being mobbed in parks and on tram-cars; of climbing\r\n\r\non the platform to lead the forlorn hope, when brother speaker after\r\n\r\nbrother speaker had been dragged down by the angry crowd and cruelly\r\n\r\nbeaten; of a siege in a church, where he and three others had taken\r\n\r\nsanctuary, and where, amid flying missiles and the crashing of stained\r\n\r\nglass, they had fought off the mob till rescued by platoons of constables;\r\n\r\nof pitched and giddy battles on stairways, galleries, and balconies;\r\n\r\nof smashed windows, collapsed stairways, wrecked lecture halls, and\r\n\r\nbroken heads and bones\u2014and then, with a regretful sigh, he looked\r\n\r\nat me and said: \u201cHow I envy you big, strong men! I\u2019m\r\n\r\nsuch a little mite I can\u2019t do much when it comes to fighting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I, walking head and shoulders above my two companions, remembered\r\n\r\nmy own husky West, and the stalwart men it had been my custom, in turn,\r\n\r\nto envy there. Also, as I looked at the mite of a youth with the\r\n\r\nheart of a lion, I thought, this is the type that on occasion rears\r\n\r\nbarricades and shows the world that men have not forgotten how to die.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut up spoke my other companion, a man of twenty-eight, who eked\r\n\r\nout a precarious existence in a sweating den.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a \u2019earty man, I am,\u201d he announced.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot like the other chaps at my shop, I ain\u2019t. They\r\n\r\nconsider me a fine specimen of manhood. W\u2019y, d\u2019 ye\r\n\r\nknow, I weigh ten stone!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI was ashamed to tell him that I weighed one hundred and seventy\r\n\r\npounds, or over twelve stone, so I contented myself with taking his\r\n\r\nmeasure. Poor, misshapen little man! His skin an unhealthy\r\n\r\ncolour, body gnarled and twisted out of all decency, contracted chest,\r\n\r\nshoulders bent prodigiously from long hours of toil, and head hanging\r\n\r\nheavily forward and out of place! A \u201c\u2019earty man,\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2019e was!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHow tall are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFive foot two,\u201d he answered proudly; \u201can\u2019\r\n\r\nthe chaps at the shop . . . \u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see that shop,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shop was idle just then, but I still desired to see it.\r\n\r\nPassing Leman Street, we cut off to the left into Spitalfields, and\r\n\r\ndived into Frying-pan Alley. A spawn of children cluttered the\r\n\r\nslimy pavement, for all the world like tadpoles just turned frogs on\r\n\r\nthe bottom of a dry pond. In a narrow doorway, so narrow that\r\n\r\nperforce we stepped over her, sat a woman with a young babe, nursing\r\n\r\nat breasts grossly naked and libelling all the sacredness of motherhood.\r\n\r\nIn the black and narrow hall behind her we waded through a mess of young\r\n\r\nlife, and essayed an even narrower and fouler stairway. Up we\r\n\r\nwent, three flights, each landing two feet by three in area, and heaped\r\n\r\nwith filth and refuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were seven rooms in this abomination called a house.\r\n\r\nIn six of the rooms, twenty-odd people, of both sexes and all ages,\r\n\r\ncooked, ate, slept, and worked. In size the rooms averaged eight\r\n\r\nfeet by eight, or possibly nine. The seventh room we entered.\r\n\r\nIt was the den in which five men \u201csweated.\u201d It was\r\n\r\nseven feet wide by eight long, and the table at which the work was performed\r\n\r\ntook up the major portion of the space. On this table were five\r\n\r\nlasts, and there was barely room for the men to stand to their work,\r\n\r\nfor the rest of the space was heaped with cardboard, leather, bundles\r\n\r\nof shoe uppers, and a miscellaneous assortment of materials used in\r\n\r\nattaching the uppers of shoes to their soles.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining room lived a woman and six children. In another\r\n\r\nvile hole lived a widow, with an only son of sixteen who was dying of\r\n\r\nconsumption. The woman hawked sweetmeats on the street, I was\r\n\r\ntold, and more often failed than not to supply her son with the three\r\n\r\nquarts of milk he daily required. Further, this son, weak and\r\n\r\ndying, did not taste meat oftener than once a week; and the kind and\r\n\r\nquality of this meat cannot possibly be imagined by people who have\r\n\r\nnever watched human swine eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe w\u2019y \u2019e coughs is somethin\u2019 terrible,\u201d\r\n\r\nvolunteered my sweated friend, referring to the dying boy. \u201cWe\r\n\r\n\u2019ear \u2019im \u2019ere, w\u2019ile we\u2019re workin\u2019,\r\n\r\nan\u2019 it\u2019s terrible, I say, terrible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, what of the coughing and the sweetmeats, I found another menace\r\n\r\nadded to the hostile environment of the children of the slum.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy sweated friend, when work was to be had, toiled with four other\r\n\r\nmen in his eight-by-seven room. In the winter a lamp burned nearly\r\n\r\nall the day and added its fumes to the over-loaded air, which was breathed,\r\n\r\nand breathed, and breathed again.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn good times, when there was a rush of work, this man told me that\r\n\r\nhe could earn as high as \u201cthirty bob a week.\u201d\u2014Thirty\r\n\r\nshillings! Seven dollars and a half!\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s only the best of us can do it,\u201d he qualified.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 then we work twelve, thirteen, and fourteen hours a\r\n\r\nday, just as fast as we can. An\u2019 you should see us sweat!\r\n\r\nJust running from us! If you could see us, it\u2019d dazzle your\r\n\r\neyes\u2014tacks flyin\u2019 out of mouth like from a machine.\r\n\r\nLook at my mouth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI looked. The teeth were worn down by the constant friction\r\n\r\nof the metallic brads, while they were coal-black and rotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI clean my teeth,\u201d he added, \u201celse they\u2019d\r\n\r\nbe worse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter he had told me that the workers had to furnish their own tools,\r\n\r\nbrads, \u201cgrindery,\u201d cardboard, rent, light, and what not,\r\n\r\nit was plain that his thirty bob was a diminishing quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how long does the rush season last, in which you receive\r\n\r\nthis high wage of thirty bob?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFour months,\u201d was the answer; and for the rest of the\r\n\r\nyear, he informed me, they average from \u201chalf a quid\u201d to\r\n\r\na \u201cquid\u201d a week, which is equivalent to from two dollars\r\n\r\nand a half to five dollars. The present week was half gone, and\r\n\r\nhe had earned four bob, or one dollar. And yet I was given to\r\n\r\nunderstand that this was one of the better grades of sweating.\r\n\r\n\r\nI looked out of the window, which should have commanded the back\r\n\r\nyards of the neighbouring buildings. But there were no back yards,\r\n\r\nor, rather, they were covered with one-storey hovels, cowsheds, in which\r\n\r\npeople lived. The roofs of these hovels were covered with deposits\r\n\r\nof filth, in some places a couple of feet deep\u2014the contributions\r\n\r\nfrom the back windows of the second and third storeys. I could\r\n\r\nmake out fish and meat bones, garbage, pestilential rags, old boots,\r\n\r\nbroken earthenware, and all the general refuse of a human sty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the last year of this trade; they\u2019re getting\r\n\r\nmachines to do away with us,\u201d said the sweated one mournfully,\r\n\r\nas we stepped over the woman with the breasts grossly naked and waded\r\n\r\nanew through the cheap young life.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe next visited the municipal dwellings erected by the London County\r\n\r\nCouncil on the site of the slums where lived Arthur Morrison\u2019s\r\n\r\n\u201cChild of the Jago.\u201d While the buildings housed more\r\n\r\npeople than before, it was much healthier. But the dwellings were\r\n\r\ninhabited by the better-class workmen and artisans. The slum people\r\n\r\nhad simply drifted on to crowd other slums or to form new slums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 now,\u201d said the sweated one, the \u2019earty\r\n\r\nman who worked so fast as to dazzle one\u2019s eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll\r\n\r\nshow you one of London\u2019s lungs. This is Spitalfields Garden.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he mouthed the word \u201cgarden\u201d with scorn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shadow of Christ\u2019s Church falls across Spitalfields Garden,\r\n\r\nand in the shadow of Christ\u2019s Church, at three o\u2019clock in\r\n\r\nthe afternoon, I saw a sight I never wish to see again. There\r\n\r\nare no flowers in this garden, which is smaller than my own rose garden\r\n\r\nat home. Grass only grows here, and it is surrounded by a sharp-spiked\r\n\r\niron fencing, as are all the parks of London Town, so that homeless\r\n\r\nmen and women may not come in at night and sleep upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we entered the garden, an old woman, between fifty and sixty,\r\n\r\npassed us, striding with sturdy intention if somewhat rickety action,\r\n\r\nwith two bulky bundles, covered with sacking, slung fore and aft upon\r\n\r\nher. She was a woman tramp, a houseless soul, too independent\r\n\r\nto drag her failing carcass through the workhouse door. Like the\r\n\r\nsnail, she carried her home with her. In the two sacking-covered\r\n\r\nbundles were her household goods, her wardrobe, linen, and dear feminine\r\n\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went up the narrow gravelled walk. On the benches on either\r\n\r\nside arrayed a mass of miserable and distorted humanity, the sight of\r\n\r\nwhich would have impelled Dor\u00e9 to more diabolical flights of\r\n\r\nfancy than he ever succeeded in achieving. It was a welter of\r\n\r\nrags and filth, of all manner of loathsome skin diseases, open sores,\r\n\r\nbruises, grossness, indecency, leering monstrosities, and bestial faces.\r\n\r\nA chill, raw wind was blowing, and these creatures huddled there in\r\n\r\ntheir rags, sleeping for the most part, or trying to sleep. Here\r\n\r\nwere a dozen women, ranging in age from twenty years to seventy.\r\n\r\nNext a babe, possibly of nine months, lying asleep, flat on the hard\r\n\r\nbench, with neither pillow nor covering, nor with any one looking after\r\n\r\nit. Next half-a-dozen men, sleeping bolt upright or leaning against\r\n\r\none another in their sleep. In one place a family group, a child\r\n\r\nasleep in its sleeping mother\u2019s arms, and the husband (or male\r\n\r\nmate) clumsily mending a dilapidated shoe. On another bench a\r\n\r\nwoman trimming the frayed strips of her rags with a knife, and another\r\n\r\nwoman, with thread and needle, sewing up rents. Adjoining, a man\r\n\r\nholding a sleeping woman in his arms. Farther on, a man, his clothing\r\n\r\ncaked with gutter mud, asleep, with head in the lap of a woman, not\r\n\r\nmore than twenty-five years old, and also asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was this sleeping that puzzled me. Why were nine out of\r\n\r\nten of them asleep or trying to sleep? But it was not till afterwards\r\n\r\nthat I learned. It is a law of the powers that be that the\r\n\r\nhomeless shall not sleep by night. On the pavement, by the\r\n\r\nportico of Christ\u2019s Church, where the stone pillars rise toward\r\n\r\nthe sky in a stately row, were whole rows of men lying asleep or drowsing,\r\n\r\nand all too deep sunk in torpor to rouse or be made curious by our intrusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cA lung of London,\u201d I said; \u201cnay, an abscess, a\r\n\r\ngreat putrescent sore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, why did you bring me here?\u201d demanded the burning\r\n\r\nyoung socialist, his delicate face white with sickness of soul and stomach\r\n\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThose women there,\u201d said our guide, \u201cwill sell\r\n\r\nthemselves for thru\u2019pence, or tu\u2019pence, or a loaf of stale\r\n\r\nbread.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe said it with a cheerful sneer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what more he might have said I do not know, for the sick man\r\n\r\ncried, \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake let us get out of this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nA WINNER OF THE VICTORIA CROSS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have found that it is not easy to get into the casual ward of the\r\n\r\nworkhouse. I have made two attempts now, and I shall shortly make\r\n\r\na third. The first time I started out at seven o\u2019clock in\r\n\r\nthe evening with four shillings in my pocket. Herein I committed\r\n\r\ntwo errors. In the first place, the applicant for admission to\r\n\r\nthe casual ward must be destitute, and as he is subjected to a rigorous\r\n\r\nsearch, he must really be destitute; and fourpence, much less four shillings,\r\n\r\nis sufficient affluence to disqualify him. In the second place,\r\n\r\nI made the mistake of tardiness. Seven o\u2019clock in the evening\r\n\r\nis too late in the day for a pauper to get a pauper\u2019s bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of gently nurtured and innocent folk, let me explain\r\n\r\nwhat a ward is. It is a building where the homeless, bedless,\r\n\r\npenniless man, if he be lucky, may casually rest his weary bones,\r\n\r\nand then work like a navvy next day to pay for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy second attempt to break into the casual ward began more auspiciously.\r\n\r\nI started in the middle of the afternoon, accompanied by the burning\r\n\r\nyoung socialist and another friend, and all I had in my pocket was thru\u2019pence.\r\n\r\nThey piloted me to the Whitechapel Workhouse, at which I peered from\r\n\r\naround a friendly corner. It was a few minutes past five in the\r\n\r\nafternoon but already a long and melancholy line was formed, which strung\r\n\r\nout around the corner of the building and out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a most woeful picture, men and women waiting in the cold grey\r\n\r\nend of the day for a pauper\u2019s shelter from the night, and I confess\r\n\r\nit almost unnerved me. Like the boy before the dentist\u2019s\r\n\r\ndoor, I suddenly discovered a multitude of reasons for being elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSome hints of the struggle going on within must have shown in my face,\r\n\r\nfor one of my companions said, \u201cDon\u2019t funk; you can do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course I could do it, but I became aware that even thru\u2019pence\r\n\r\nin my pocket was too lordly a treasure for such a throng; and, in order\r\n\r\nthat all invidious distinctions might be removed, I emptied out the\r\n\r\ncoppers. Then I bade good-bye to my friends, and with my heart\r\n\r\ngoing pit-a-pat, slouched down the street and took my place at the end\r\n\r\nof the line. Woeful it looked, this line of poor folk tottering\r\n\r\non the steep pitch to death; how woeful it was I did not dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to me stood a short, stout man. Hale and hearty, though\r\n\r\naged, strong-featured, with the tough and leathery skin produced by\r\n\r\nlong years of sunbeat and weatherbeat, his was the unmistakable sea\r\n\r\nface and eyes; and at once there came to me a bit of Kipling\u2019s\r\n\r\n\u201cGalley Slave\u201d:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the brand upon my shoulder, by the gall of clinging steel;\r\n\r\nBy the welt the whips have left me, by the scars that never heal;\r\n\r\nBy eyes grown old with staring through the sun-wash on the brine,\r\n\r\nI am paid in full for service . . . \u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHow correct I was in my surmise, and how peculiarly appropriate the\r\n\r\nverse was, you shall learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t stand it much longer, I won\u2019t,\u201d\r\n\r\nhe was complaining to the man on the other side of him. \u201cI\u2019ll\r\n\r\nsmash a windy, a big \u2019un, an\u2019 get run in for fourteen days.\r\n\r\nThen I\u2019ll have a good place to sleep, never fear, an\u2019 better\r\n\r\ngrub than you get here. Though I\u2019d miss my bit of baccy\u201d\u2014this\r\n\r\nas an after-thought, and said regretfully and resignedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out two nights now,\u201d he went on; \u201cwet\r\n\r\nto the skin night before last, an\u2019 I can\u2019t stand it much\r\n\r\nlonger. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 old, an\u2019 some mornin\u2019\r\n\r\nthey\u2019ll pick me up dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe whirled with fierce passion on me: \u201cDon\u2019t you ever\r\n\r\nlet yourself grow old, lad. Die when you\u2019re young, or you\u2019ll\r\n\r\ncome to this. I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you sure. Seven an\u2019\r\n\r\neighty years am I, an\u2019 served my country like a man. Three\r\n\r\ngood-conduct stripes and the Victoria Cross, an\u2019 this is what\r\n\r\nI get for it. I wish I was dead, I wish I was dead. Can\u2019t\r\n\r\ncome any too quick for me, I tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moisture rushed into his eyes, but, before the other man could\r\n\r\ncomfort him, he began to hum a lilting sea song as though there was\r\n\r\nno such thing as heartbreak in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven encouragement, this is the story he told while waiting in line\r\n\r\nat the workhouse after two nights of exposure in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a boy he had enlisted in the British navy, and for two score years\r\n\r\nand more served faithfully and well. Names, dates, commanders,\r\n\r\nports, ships, engagements, and battles, rolled from his lips in a steady\r\n\r\nstream, but it is beyond me to remember them all, for it is not quite\r\n\r\nin keeping to take notes at the poorhouse door. He had been through\r\n\r\nthe \u201cFirst War in China,\u201d as he termed it; had enlisted\r\n\r\nwith the East India Company and served ten years in India; was back\r\n\r\nin India again, in the English navy, at the time of the Mutiny; had\r\n\r\nserved in the Burmese War and in the Crimea; and all this in addition\r\n\r\nto having fought and toiled for the English flag pretty well over the\r\n\r\nrest of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the thing happened. A little thing, it could only be traced\r\n\r\nback to first causes: perhaps the lieutenant\u2019s breakfast had not\r\n\r\nagreed with him; or he had been up late the night before; or his debts\r\n\r\nwere pressing; or the commander had spoken brusquely to him. The\r\n\r\npoint is, that on this particular day the lieutenant was irritable.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, with others, was \u201csetting up\u201d the fore rigging.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, mark you, the sailor had been over forty years in the navy,\r\n\r\nhad three good-conduct stripes, and possessed the Victoria Cross for\r\n\r\ndistinguished service in battle; so he could not have been such an altogether\r\n\r\nbad sort of a sailorman. The lieutenant was irritable; the lieutenant\r\n\r\ncalled him a name\u2014well, not a nice sort of name. It referred\r\n\r\nto his mother. When I was a boy it was our boys\u2019 code to\r\n\r\nfight like little demons should such an insult be given our mothers;\r\n\r\nand many men have died in my part of the world for calling other men\r\n\r\nthis name.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the lieutenant called the sailor this name. At that\r\n\r\nmoment it chanced the sailor had an iron lever or bar in his hands.\r\n\r\nHe promptly struck the lieutenant over the head with it, knocking him\r\n\r\nout of the rigging and overboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the man\u2019s own words: \u201cI saw what I had done.\r\n\r\nI knew the Regulations, and I said to myself, \u2018It\u2019s all\r\n\r\nup with you, Jack, my boy; so here goes.\u2019 An\u2019 I jumped\r\n\r\nover after him, my mind made up to drown us both. An\u2019 I\u2019d\r\n\r\nha\u2019 done it, too, only the pinnace from the flagship was just\r\n\r\ncomin\u2019 alongside. Up we came to the top, me a hold of him\r\n\r\nan\u2019 punchin\u2019 him. This was what settled for me.\r\n\r\nIf I hadn\u2019t ben strikin\u2019 him, I could have claimed that,\r\n\r\nseein\u2019 what I had done, I jumped over to save him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThen came the court-martial, or whatever name a sea trial goes by.\r\n\r\nHe recited his sentence, word for word, as though memorised and gone\r\n\r\nover in bitterness many times. And here it is, for the sake of\r\n\r\ndiscipline and respect to officers not always gentlemen, the punishment\r\n\r\nof a man who was guilty of manhood. To be reduced to the rank\r\n\r\nof ordinary seaman; to be debarred all prize-money due him; to forfeit\r\n\r\nall rights to pension; to resign the Victoria Cross; to be discharged\r\n\r\nfrom the navy with a good character (this being his first offence);\r\n\r\nto receive fifty lashes; and to serve two years in prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I had drowned that day, I wish to God I had,\u201d\r\n\r\nhe concluded, as the line moved up and we passed around the corner.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the door came in sight, through which the paupers were being\r\n\r\nadmitted in bunches. And here I learned a surprising thing: this\r\n\r\nbeing Wednesday, none of us would be released till Friday morning.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, and oh, you tobacco users, take heed: we would not be\r\n\r\npermitted to take in any tobacco. This we would have to surrender\r\n\r\nas we entered. Sometimes, I was told, it was returned on leaving\r\n\r\nand sometimes it was destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old man-of-war\u2019s man gave me a lesson. Opening his\r\n\r\npouch, he emptied the tobacco (a pitiful quantity) into a piece of paper.\r\n\r\nThis, snugly and flatly wrapped, went down his sock inside his shoe.\r\n\r\nDown went my piece of tobacco inside my sock, for forty hours without\r\n\r\ntobacco is a hardship all tobacco users will understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain and again the line moved up, and we were slowly but surely\r\n\r\napproaching the wicket. At the moment we happened to be standing\r\n\r\non an iron grating, and a man appearing underneath, the old sailor called\r\n\r\ndown to him,\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many more do they want?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-four,\u201d came the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe looked ahead anxiously and counted. Thirty-four were ahead\r\n\r\nof us. Disappointment and consternation dawned upon the faces\r\n\r\nabout me. It is not a nice thing, hungry and penniless, to face\r\n\r\na sleepless night in the streets. But we hoped against hope, till,\r\n\r\nwhen ten stood outside the wicket, the porter turned us away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFull up,\u201d was what he said, as he banged the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a flash, for all his eighty-seven years, the old sailor was\r\n\r\nspeeding away on the desperate chance of finding shelter elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI stood and debated with two other men, wise in the knowledge of casual\r\n\r\nwards, as to where we should go. They decided on the Poplar Workhouse,\r\n\r\nthree miles away, and we started off.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we rounded the corner, one of them said, \u201cI could a\u2019\r\n\r\ngot in \u2019ere to-day. I come by at one o\u2019clock, an\u2019\r\n\r\nthe line was beginnin\u2019 to form then\u2014pets, that\u2019s what\r\n\r\nthey are. They let \u2019m in, the same ones, night upon night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CARTER AND THE CARPENTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carter, with his clean-cut face, chin beard, and shaved upper\r\n\r\nlip, I should have taken in the United States for anything from a master\r\n\r\nworkman to a well-to-do farmer. The Carpenter\u2014well, I should\r\n\r\nhave taken him for a carpenter. He looked it, lean and wiry, with\r\n\r\nshrewd, observant eyes, and hands that had grown twisted to the handles\r\n\r\nof tools through forty-seven years\u2019 work at the trade. The\r\n\r\nchief difficulty with these men was that they were old, and that their\r\n\r\nchildren, instead of growing up to take care of them, had died.\r\n\r\nTheir years had told on them, and they had been forced out of the whirl\r\n\r\nof industry by the younger and stronger competitors who had taken their\r\n\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two men, turned away from the casual ward of Whitechapel Workhouse,\r\n\r\nwere bound with me for Poplar Workhouse. Not much of a show, they\r\n\r\nthought, but to chance it was all that remained to us. It was\r\n\r\nPoplar, or the streets and night. Both men were anxious for a\r\n\r\nbed, for they were \u201cabout gone,\u201d as they phrased it.\r\n\r\nThe Carter, fifty-eight years of age, had spent the last three nights\r\n\r\nwithout shelter or sleep, while the Carpenter, sixty-five years of age,\r\n\r\nhad been out five nights.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, O dear, soft people, full of meat and blood, with white beds\r\n\r\nand airy rooms waiting you each night, how can I make you know what\r\n\r\nit is to suffer as you would suffer if you spent a weary night on London\u2019s\r\n\r\nstreets! Believe me, you would think a thousand centuries had\r\n\r\ncome and gone before the east paled into dawn; you would shiver till\r\n\r\nyou were ready to cry aloud with the pain of each aching muscle; and\r\n\r\nyou would marvel that you could endure so much and live. Should\r\n\r\nyou rest upon a bench, and your tired eyes close, depend upon it the\r\n\r\npoliceman would rouse you and gruffly order you to \u201cmove on.\u201d\r\n\r\nYou may rest upon the bench, and benches are few and far between; but\r\n\r\nif rest means sleep, on you must go, dragging your tired body through\r\n\r\nthe endless streets. Should you, in desperate slyness, seek some\r\n\r\nforlorn alley or dark passageway and lie down, the omnipresent policeman\r\n\r\nwill rout you out just the same. It is his business to rout you\r\n\r\nout. It is a law of the powers that be that you shall be routed\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when the dawn came, the nightmare over, you would hale you home\r\n\r\nto refresh yourself, and until you died you would tell the story of\r\n\r\nyour adventure to groups of admiring friends. It would grow into\r\n\r\na mighty story. Your little eight-hour night would become an Odyssey\r\n\r\nand you a Homer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot so with these homeless ones who walked to Poplar Workhouse with\r\n\r\nme. And there are thirty-five thousand of them, men and women,\r\n\r\nin London Town this night. Please don\u2019t remember it as you\r\n\r\ngo to bed; if you are as soft as you ought to be you may not rest so\r\n\r\nwell as usual. But for old men of sixty, seventy, and eighty,\r\n\r\nill-fed, with neither meat nor blood, to greet the dawn unrefreshed,\r\n\r\nand to stagger through the day in mad search for crusts, with relentless\r\n\r\nnight rushing down upon them again, and to do this five nights and days\u2014O\r\n\r\ndear, soft people, full of meat and blood, how can you ever understand?\r\n\r\n\r\nI walked up Mile End Road between the Carter and the Carpenter.\r\n\r\nMile End Road is a wide thoroughfare, cutting the heart of East London,\r\n\r\nand there were tens of thousands of people abroad on it. I tell\r\n\r\nyou this so that you may fully appreciate what I shall describe in the\r\n\r\nnext paragraph. As I say, we walked along, and when they grew\r\n\r\nbitter and cursed the land, I cursed with them, cursed as an American\r\n\r\nwaif would curse, stranded in a strange and terrible land. And,\r\n\r\nas I tried to lead them to believe, and succeeded in making them believe,\r\n\r\nthey took me for a \u201cseafaring man,\u201d who had spent his money\r\n\r\nin riotous living, lost his clothes (no unusual occurrence with seafaring\r\n\r\nmen ashore), and was temporarily broke while looking for a ship.\r\n\r\nThis accounted for my ignorance of English ways in general and casual\r\n\r\nwards in particular, and my curiosity concerning the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carter was hard put to keep the pace at which we walked (he told\r\n\r\nme that he had eaten nothing that day), but the Carpenter, lean and\r\n\r\nhungry, his grey and ragged overcoat flapping mournfully in the breeze,\r\n\r\nswung on in a long and tireless stride which reminded me strongly of\r\n\r\nthe plains wolf or coyote. Both kept their eyes upon the pavement\r\n\r\nas they walked and talked, and every now and then one or the other would\r\n\r\nstoop and pick something up, never missing the stride the while.\r\n\r\nI thought it was cigar and cigarette stumps they were collecting, and\r\n\r\nfor some time took no notice. Then I did notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the slimy, spittle-drenched, sidewalk, they were picking\r\n\r\nup bits of orange peel, apple skin, and grape stems, and, they were\r\n\r\neating them. The pits of greengage plums they cracked between\r\n\r\ntheir teeth for the kernels inside. They picked up stray bits\r\n\r\nof bread the size of peas, apple cores so black and dirty one would\r\n\r\nnot take them to be apple cores, and these things these two men took\r\n\r\ninto their mouths, and chewed them, and swallowed them; and this, between\r\n\r\nsix and seven o\u2019clock in the evening of August 20, year of our\r\n\r\nLord 1902, in the heart of the greatest, wealthiest, and most powerful\r\n\r\nempire the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two men talked. They were not fools, they were merely\r\n\r\nold. And, naturally, their guts a-reek with pavement offal, they\r\n\r\ntalked of bloody revolution. They talked as anarchists, fanatics,\r\n\r\nand madmen would talk. And who shall blame them? In spite\r\n\r\nof my three good meals that day, and the snug bed I could occupy if\r\n\r\nI wished, and my social philosophy, and my evolutionary belief in the\r\n\r\nslow development and metamorphosis of things\u2014in spite of all this,\r\n\r\nI say, I felt impelled to talk rot with them or hold my tongue.\r\n\r\nPoor fools! Not of their sort are revolutions bred. And\r\n\r\nwhen they are dead and dust, which will be shortly, other fools will\r\n\r\ntalk bloody revolution as they gather offal from the spittle-drenched\r\n\r\nsidewalk along Mile End Road to Poplar Workhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing a foreigner, and a young man, the Carter and the Carpenter\r\n\r\nexplained things to me and advised me. Their advice, by the way,\r\n\r\nwas brief, and to the point; it was to get out of the country.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs fast as God\u2019ll let me,\u201d I assured them; \u201cI\u2019ll\r\n\r\nhit only the high places, till you won\u2019t be able to see my trail\r\n\r\nfor smoke.\u201d They felt the force of my figures, rather than\r\n\r\nunderstood them, and they nodded their heads approvingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cActually make a man a criminal against \u2019is will,\u201d said the\r\n\r\nCarpenter. \u201c\u2019Ere I am, old, younger men takin\u2019 my place, my\r\n\r\nclothes gettin\u2019 shabbier an\u2019 shabbier, an\u2019 makin\u2019 it\r\n\r\n\u2019arder every day to get a job. I go to the casual ward for a bed. Must be\r\n\r\nthere by two or three in the afternoon or I won\u2019t get in. You saw what\r\n\r\nhappened to-day. What chance does that give me to look for work? S\u2019pose I\r\n\r\ndo get into the casual ward? Keep me in all day to-morrow, let me out\r\n\r\nmornin\u2019 o\u2019 next day. What then? The law sez I can\u2019t get in\r\n\r\nanother casual ward that night less\u2019n ten miles distant. Have to hurry\r\n\r\nan\u2019 walk to be there in time that day. What chance does that give me to\r\n\r\nlook for a job? S\u2019pose I don\u2019t walk. S\u2019pose I look for a job?\r\n\r\nIn no time there\u2019s night come, an\u2019 no bed. No sleep all night,\r\n\r\nnothin\u2019 to eat, what shape am I in in the mornin\u2019 to look for work?\r\n\r\nGot to make up my sleep in the park somehow\u201d (the vision of\r\n\r\nChrist\u2019s Church, Spitalfield, was strong on me) \u201can\u2019 get\r\n\r\nsomething to eat. An\u2019 there I am! Old, down, an\u2019 no chance to get\r\n\r\nup.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cUsed to be a toll-gate \u2019ere,\u201d said the Carter.\r\n\r\n\u201cMany\u2019s the time I\u2019ve paid my toll \u2019ere in my\r\n\r\ncartin\u2019 days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve \u2019ad three \u2019a\u2019penny rolls in two\r\n\r\ndays,\u201d the Carpenter announced, after a long pause in the conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo of them I ate yesterday, an\u2019 the third to-day,\u201d\r\n\r\nhe concluded, after another long pause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI ain\u2019t \u2019ad anything to-day,\u201d said the Carter.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019m fagged out. My legs is hurtin\u2019\r\n\r\nme something fearful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe roll you get in the \u2018spike\u2019 is that \u2019ard\r\n\r\nyou can\u2019t eat it nicely with less\u2019n a pint of water,\u201d\r\n\r\nsaid the Carpenter, for my benefit. And, on asking him what the\r\n\r\n\u201cspike\u201d was, he answered, \u201cThe casual ward.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a cant word, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what surprised me was that he should have the word \u201ccant\u201d\r\n\r\nin his vocabulary, a vocabulary that I found was no mean one before\r\n\r\nwe parted.\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked them what I might expect in the way of treatment, if we succeeded\r\n\r\nin getting into the Poplar Workhouse, and between them I was supplied\r\n\r\nwith much information. Having taken a cold bath on entering, I\r\n\r\nwould be given for supper six ounces of bread and \u201cthree parts\r\n\r\nof skilly.\u201d \u201cThree parts\u201d means three-quarters\r\n\r\nof a pint, and \u201cskilly\u201d is a fluid concoction of three quarts\r\n\r\nof oatmeal stirred into three buckets and a half of hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMilk and sugar, I suppose, and a silver spoon?\u201d I queried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo fear. Salt\u2019s what you\u2019ll get, an\u2019\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen some places where you\u2019d not get any spoon.\r\n\r\n\u2019Old \u2019er up an\u2019 let \u2019er run down, that\u2019s\r\n\r\n\u2019ow they do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do get good skilly at \u2019Ackney,\u201d said the Carter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, wonderful skilly, that,\u201d praised the Carpenter,\r\n\r\nand each looked eloquently at the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFlour an\u2019 water at St. George\u2019s in the East,\u201d\r\n\r\nsaid the Carter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carpenter nodded. He had tried them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what?\u201d I demanded\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I was informed that I was sent directly to bed. \u201cCall\r\n\r\nyou at half after five in the mornin\u2019, an\u2019 you get up an\u2019\r\n\r\ntake a \u2018sluice\u2019\u2014if there\u2019s any soap. Then\r\n\r\nbreakfast, same as supper, three parts o\u2019 skilly an\u2019 a six-ounce\r\n\r\nloaf.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t always six ounces,\u201d corrected the\r\n\r\nCarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t, no; an\u2019 often that sour you can\r\n\r\n\u2019ardly eat it. When first I started I couldn\u2019t eat\r\n\r\nthe skilly nor the bread, but now I can eat my own an\u2019 another\r\n\r\nman\u2019s portion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI could eat three other men\u2019s portions,\u201d said\r\n\r\nthe Carter. \u201cI \u2019aven\u2019t \u2019ad a bit this\r\n\r\nblessed day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got to do your task, pick four pounds of\r\n\r\noakum, or clean an\u2019 scrub, or break ten to eleven hundredweight\r\n\r\no\u2019 stones. I don\u2019t \u2019ave to break stones; I\u2019m\r\n\r\npast sixty, you see. They\u2019ll make you do it, though.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re young an\u2019 strong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like,\u201d grumbled the Carter, \u201cis\r\n\r\nto be locked up in a cell to pick oakum. It\u2019s too much like\r\n\r\nprison.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut suppose, after you\u2019ve had your night\u2019s sleep,\r\n\r\nyou refuse to pick oakum, or break stones, or do any work at all?\u201d\r\n\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo fear you\u2019ll refuse the second time; they\u2019ll\r\n\r\nrun you in,\u201d answered the Carpenter. \u201cWouldn\u2019t\r\n\r\nadvise you to try it on, my lad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThen comes dinner,\u201d he went on. \u201cEight ounces of bread, one\r\n\r\nand a arf ounces of cheese, an\u2019 cold water. Then you finish your task\r\n\r\nan\u2019 \u2019ave supper, same as before, three parts o\u2019 skilly\r\n\r\nan\u2019 six ounces o\u2019 bread. Then to bed, six o\u2019clock, an\u2019\r\n\r\nnext mornin\u2019 you\u2019re turned loose, provided you\u2019ve finished\r\n\r\nyour task.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had long since left Mile End Road, and after traversing a gloomy\r\n\r\nmaze of narrow, winding streets, we came to Poplar Workhouse.\r\n\r\nOn a low stone wall we spread our handkerchiefs, and each in his handkerchief\r\n\r\nput all his worldly possessions, with the exception of the \u201cbit\r\n\r\no\u2019 baccy\u201d down his sock. And then, as the last light\r\n\r\nwas fading from the drab-coloured sky, the wind blowing cheerless and\r\n\r\ncold, we stood, with our pitiful little bundles in our hands, a forlorn\r\n\r\ngroup at the workhouse door.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree working girls came along, and one looked pityingly at me; as\r\n\r\nshe passed I followed her with my eyes, and she still looked pityingly\r\n\r\nback at me. The old men she did not notice. Dear Christ,\r\n\r\nshe pitied me, young and vigorous and strong, but she had no pity for\r\n\r\nthe two old men who stood by my side! She was a young woman, and\r\n\r\nI was a young man, and what vague sex promptings impelled her to pity\r\n\r\nme put her sentiment on the lowest plane. Pity for old men is\r\n\r\nan altruistic feeling, and besides, the workhouse door is the accustomed\r\n\r\nplace for old men. So she showed no pity for them, only for me,\r\n\r\nwho deserved it least or not at all. Not in honour do grey hairs\r\n\r\ngo down to the grave in London Town.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one side the door was a bell handle, on the other side a press\r\n\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cRing the bell,\u201d said the Carter to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd just as I ordinarily would at anybody\u2019s door, I pulled\r\n\r\nout the handle and rang a peal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! Oh!\u201d they cried in one terrified voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so \u2019ard!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI let go, and they looked reproachfully at me, as though I had imperilled\r\n\r\ntheir chance for a bed and three parts of skilly. Nobody came.\r\n\r\nLuckily it was the wrong bell, and I felt better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cPress the button,\u201d I said to the Carpenter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, wait a bit,\u201d the Carter hurriedly interposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom all of which I drew the conclusion that a poorhouse porter,\r\n\r\nwho commonly draws a yearly salary of from seven to nine pounds, is\r\n\r\na very finicky and important personage, and cannot be treated too fastidiously\r\n\r\nby\u2014paupers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we waited, ten times a decent interval, when the Carter stealthily\r\n\r\nadvanced a timid forefinger to the button, and gave it the faintest,\r\n\r\nshortest possible push. I have looked at waiting men where life\r\n\r\nor death was in the issue; but anxious suspense showed less plainly\r\n\r\non their faces than it showed on the faces of these two men as they\r\n\r\nwaited on the coming of the porter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe came. He barely looked at us. \u201cFull up,\u201d\r\n\r\nhe said and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother night of it,\u201d groaned the Carpenter. In\r\n\r\nthe dim light the Carter looked wan and grey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndiscriminate charity is vicious, say the professional philanthropists.\r\n\r\nWell, I resolved to be vicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on; get your knife out and come here,\u201d I said to\r\n\r\nthe Carter, drawing him into a dark alley.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe glared at me in a frightened manner, and tried to draw back.\r\n\r\nPossibly he took me for a latter-day Jack-the-Ripper, with a penchant\r\n\r\nfor elderly male paupers. Or he may have thought I was inveigling\r\n\r\nhim into the commission of some desperate crime. Anyway, he was\r\n\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, at the outset, that I sewed a pound inside\r\n\r\nmy stoker\u2019s singlet under the armpit. This was my emergency\r\n\r\nfund, and I was now called upon to use it for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot until I had gone through the acts of a contortionist, and shown\r\n\r\nthe round coin sewed in, did I succeed in getting the Carter\u2019s\r\n\r\nhelp. Even then his hand was trembling so that I was afraid he\r\n\r\nwould cut me instead of the stitches, and I was forced to take the knife\r\n\r\naway and do it myself. Out rolled the gold piece, a fortune in\r\n\r\ntheir hungry eyes; and away we stampeded for the nearest coffee-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course I had to explain to them that I was merely an investigator,\r\n\r\na social student, seeking to find out how the other half lived.\r\n\r\nAnd at once they shut up like clams. I was not of their kind;\r\n\r\nmy speech had changed, the tones of my voice were different, in short,\r\n\r\nI was a superior, and they were superbly class conscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you have?\u201d I asked, as the waiter came for\r\n\r\nthe order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo slices an\u2019 a cup of tea,\u201d meekly said the\r\n\r\nCarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo slices an\u2019 a cup of tea,\u201d meekly said the\r\n\r\nCarpenter.\r\n\r\n\r\nStop a moment, and consider the situation. Here were two men,\r\n\r\ninvited by me into the coffee-house. They had seen my gold piece,\r\n\r\nand they could understand that I was no pauper. One had eaten\r\n\r\na ha\u2019penny roll that day, the other had eaten nothing. And\r\n\r\nthey called for \u201ctwo slices an\u2019 a cup of tea!\u201d\r\n\r\nEach man had given a tu\u2019penny order. \u201cTwo slices,\u201d\r\n\r\nby the way, means two slices of bread and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the same degraded humility that had characterised their\r\n\r\nattitude toward the poorhouse porter. But I wouldn\u2019t have\r\n\r\nit. Step by step I increased their order\u2014eggs, rashers of\r\n\r\nbacon, more eggs, more bacon, more tea, more slices and so forth\u2014they\r\n\r\ndenying wistfully all the while that they cared for anything more, and\r\n\r\ndevouring it ravenously as fast as it arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst cup o\u2019 tea I\u2019ve \u2019ad in a fortnight,\u201d\r\n\r\nsaid the Carter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWonderful tea, that,\u201d said the Carpenter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey each drank two pints of it, and I assure you that it was slops.\r\n\r\nIt resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne. Nay,\r\n\r\nit was \u201cwater-bewitched,\u201d and did not resemble tea at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was curious, after the first shock, to notice the effect the food\r\n\r\nhad on them. At first they were melancholy, and talked of the\r\n\r\ndivers times they had contemplated suicide. The Carter, not a\r\n\r\nweek before, had stood on the bridge and looked at the water, and pondered\r\n\r\nthe question. Water, the Carpenter insisted with heat, was a bad\r\n\r\nroute. He, for one, he knew, would struggle. A bullet was\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019andier,\u201d but how under the sun was he to get hold\r\n\r\nof a revolver? That was the rub.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey grew more cheerful as the hot \u201ctea\u201d soaked in, and\r\n\r\ntalked more about themselves. The Carter had buried his wife and\r\n\r\nchildren, with the exception of one son, who grew to manhood and helped\r\n\r\nhim in his little business. Then the thing happened. The\r\n\r\nson, a man of thirty-one, died of the smallpox. No sooner was\r\n\r\nthis over than the father came down with fever and went to the hospital\r\n\r\nfor three months. Then he was done for. He came out weak,\r\n\r\ndebilitated, no strong young son to stand by him, his little business\r\n\r\ngone glimmering, and not a farthing. The thing had happened, and\r\n\r\nthe game was up. No chance for an old man to start again.\r\n\r\nFriends all poor and unable to help. He had tried for work when\r\n\r\nthey were putting up the stands for the first Coronation parade.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 I got fair sick of the answer: \u2018No! no! no!\u2019\r\n\r\nIt rang in my ears at night when I tried to sleep, always the same,\r\n\r\n\u2018No! no! no!\u2019\u201d Only the past week he had answered\r\n\r\nan advertisement in Hackney, and on giving his age was told, \u201cOh,\r\n\r\ntoo old, too old by far.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carpenter had been born in the army, where his father had served\r\n\r\ntwenty-two years. Likewise, his two brothers had gone into the\r\n\r\narmy; one, troop sergeant-major of the Seventh Hussars, dying in India\r\n\r\nafter the Mutiny; the other, after nine years under Roberts in the East,\r\n\r\nhad been lost in Egypt. The Carpenter had not gone into the army,\r\n\r\nso here he was, still on the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut \u2019ere, give me your \u2019and,\u201d he said, ripping\r\n\r\nopen his ragged shirt. \u201cI\u2019m fit for the anatomist,\r\n\r\nthat\u2019s all. I\u2019m wastin\u2019 away, sir, actually\r\n\r\nwastin\u2019 away for want of food. Feel my ribs an\u2019 you\u2019ll\r\n\r\nsee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI put my hand under his shirt and felt. The skin was stretched\r\n\r\nlike parchment over the bones, and the sensation produced was for all\r\n\r\nthe world like running one\u2019s hand over a washboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven years o\u2019 bliss I \u2019ad,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cA good missus and three bonnie lassies. But they all died.\r\n\r\nScarlet fever took the girls inside a fortnight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter this, sir,\u201d said the Carter, indicating the spread,\r\n\r\nand desiring to turn the conversation into more cheerful channels; \u201cafter\r\n\r\nthis, I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat a workhouse breakfast in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I,\u201d agreed the Carpenter, and they fell to discussing\r\n\r\nbelly delights and the fine dishes their respective wives had cooked\r\n\r\nin the old days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone three days and never broke my fast,\u201d\r\n\r\nsaid the Carter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I, five,\u201d his companion added, turning gloomy with\r\n\r\nthe memory of it. \u201cFive days once, with nothing on my stomach\r\n\r\nbut a bit of orange peel, an\u2019 outraged nature wouldn\u2019t stand\r\n\r\nit, sir, an\u2019 I near died. Sometimes, walkin\u2019 the streets\r\n\r\nat night, I\u2019ve ben that desperate I\u2019ve made up my mind to\r\n\r\nwin the horse or lose the saddle. You know what I mean, sir\u2014to\r\n\r\ncommit some big robbery. But when mornin\u2019 come, there was\r\n\r\nI, too weak from \u2019unger an\u2019 cold to \u2019arm a mouse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAs their poor vitals warmed to the food, they began to expand and\r\n\r\nwax boastful, and to talk politics. I can only say that they talked\r\n\r\npolitics as well as the average middle-class man, and a great deal better\r\n\r\nthan some of the middle-class men I have heard. What surprised\r\n\r\nme was the hold they had on the world, its geography and peoples, and\r\n\r\non recent and contemporaneous history. As I say, they were not\r\n\r\nfools, these two men. They were merely old, and their children\r\n\r\nhad undutifully failed to grow up and give them a place by the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne last incident, as I bade them good-bye on the corner, happy with\r\n\r\na couple of shillings in their pockets and the certain prospect of a\r\n\r\nbed for the night. Lighting a cigarette, I was about to throw\r\n\r\naway the burning match when the Carter reached for it. I proffered\r\n\r\nhim the box, but he said, \u201cNever mind, won\u2019t waste it, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd while he lighted the cigarette I had given him, the Carpenter hurried\r\n\r\nwith the filling of his pipe in order to have a go at the same match.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to waste,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, but I was thinking of the wash-board ribs\r\n\r\nover which I had run my hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE SPIKE\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I must beg forgiveness of my body for the vileness\r\n\r\nthrough which I have dragged it, and forgiveness of my stomach for the\r\n\r\nvileness which I have thrust into it. I have been to the spike,\r\n\r\nand slept in the spike, and eaten in the spike; also, I have run away\r\n\r\nfrom the spike.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter my two unsuccessful attempts to penetrate the Whitechapel casual\r\n\r\nward, I started early, and joined the desolate line before three o\u2019clock\r\n\r\nin the afternoon. They did not \u201clet in\u201d till six,\r\n\r\nbut at that early hour I was number twenty, while the news had gone\r\n\r\nforth that only twenty-two were to be admitted. By four o\u2019clock\r\n\r\nthere were thirty-four in line, the last ten hanging on in the slender\r\n\r\nhope of getting in by some kind of a miracle. Many more came,\r\n\r\nlooked at the line, and went away, wise to the bitter fact that the\r\n\r\nspike would be \u201cfull up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nConversation was slack at first, standing there, till the man on\r\n\r\none side of me and the man on the other side of me discovered that they\r\n\r\nhad been in the smallpox hospital at the same time, though a full house\r\n\r\nof sixteen hundred patients had prevented their becoming acquainted.\r\n\r\nBut they made up for it, discussing and comparing the more loathsome\r\n\r\nfeatures of their disease in the most cold-blooded, matter-of-fact way.\r\n\r\nI learned that the average mortality was one in six, that one of them\r\n\r\nhad been in three months and the other three months and a half, and\r\n\r\nthat they had been \u201crotten wi\u2019 it.\u201d Whereat\r\n\r\nmy flesh began to creep and crawl, and I asked them how long they had\r\n\r\nbeen out. One had been out two weeks, and the other three weeks.\r\n\r\nTheir faces were badly pitted (though each assured the other that this\r\n\r\nwas not so), and further, they showed me in their hands and under the\r\n\r\nnails the smallpox \u201cseeds\u201d still working out. Nay,\r\n\r\none of them worked a seed out for my edification, and pop it went, right\r\n\r\nout of his flesh into the air. I tried to shrink up smaller inside\r\n\r\nmy clothes, and I registered a fervent though silent hope that it had\r\n\r\nnot popped on me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn both instances, I found that the smallpox was the cause of their\r\n\r\nbeing \u201con the doss,\u201d which means on the tramp. Both\r\n\r\nhad been working when smitten by the disease, and both had emerged from\r\n\r\nthe hospital \u201cbroke,\u201d with the gloomy task before them of\r\n\r\nhunting for work. So far, they had not found any, and they had\r\n\r\ncome to the spike for a \u201crest up\u201d after three days and nights\r\n\r\non the street.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems that not only the man who becomes old is punished for his\r\n\r\ninvoluntary misfortune, but likewise the man who is struck by disease\r\n\r\nor accident. Later on, I talked with another man\u2014\u201cGinger\u201d\r\n\r\nwe called him\u2014who stood at the head of the line\u2014a sure indication\r\n\r\nthat he had been waiting since one o\u2019clock. A year before,\r\n\r\none day, while in the employ of a fish dealer, he was carrying a heavy\r\n\r\nbox of fish which was too much for him. Result: \u201csomething\r\n\r\nbroke,\u201d and there was the box on the ground, and he on the ground\r\n\r\nbeside it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the first hospital, whither he was immediately carried, they said\r\n\r\nit was a rupture, reduced the swelling, gave him some vaseline to rub\r\n\r\non it, kept him four hours, and told him to get along. But he\r\n\r\nwas not on the streets more than two or three hours when he was down\r\n\r\non his back again. This time he went to another hospital and was\r\n\r\npatched up. But the point is, the employer did nothing, positively\r\n\r\nnothing, for the man injured in his employment, and even refused him\r\n\r\n\u201ca light job now and again,\u201d when he came out. As\r\n\r\nfar as Ginger is concerned, he is a broken man. His only chance\r\n\r\nto earn a living was by heavy work. He is now incapable of performing\r\n\r\nheavy work, and from now until he dies, the spike, the peg, and the\r\n\r\nstreets are all he can look forward to in the way of food and shelter.\r\n\r\nThe thing happened\u2014that is all. He put his back under too\r\n\r\ngreat a load of fish, and his chance for happiness in life was crossed\r\n\r\noff the books.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral men in the line had been to the United States, and they were\r\n\r\nwishing that they had remained there, and were cursing themselves for\r\n\r\ntheir folly in ever having left. England had become a prison to\r\n\r\nthem, a prison from which there was no hope of escape. It was\r\n\r\nimpossible for them to get away. They could neither scrape together\r\n\r\nthe passage money, nor get a chance to work their passage. The\r\n\r\ncountry was too overrun by poor devils on that \u201clay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI was on the seafaring-man-who-had-lost-his-clothes-and-money tack,\r\n\r\nand they all condoled with me and gave me much sound advice. To\r\n\r\nsum it up, the advice was something like this: To keep out of all places\r\n\r\nlike the spike. There was nothing good in it for me. To\r\n\r\nhead for the coast and bend every effort to get away on a ship.\r\n\r\nTo go to work, if possible, and scrape together a pound or so, with\r\n\r\nwhich I might bribe some steward or underling to give me chance to work\r\n\r\nmy passage. They envied me my youth and strength, which would\r\n\r\nsooner or later get me out of the country. These they no longer\r\n\r\npossessed. Age and English hardship had broken them, and for them\r\n\r\nthe game was played and up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one, however, who was still young, and who, I am sure,\r\n\r\nwill in the end make it out. He had gone to the United States\r\n\r\nas a young fellow, and in fourteen years\u2019 residence the longest\r\n\r\nperiod he had been out of work was twelve hours. He had saved\r\n\r\nhis money, grown too prosperous, and returned to the mother-country.\r\n\r\nNow he was standing in line at the spike.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the past two years, he told me, he had been working as a cook.\r\n\r\nHis hours had been from 7 a.m. to 10.30 p.m., and on Saturday to 12.30\r\n\r\np.m.\u2014ninety-five hours per week, for which he had received twenty\r\n\r\nshillings, or five dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the work and the long hours was killing me,\u201d he\r\n\r\nsaid, \u201cand I had to chuck the job. I had a little money\r\n\r\nsaved, but I spent it living and looking for another place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was his first night in the spike, and he had come in only to\r\n\r\nget rested. As soon as he emerged, he intended to start for Bristol,\r\n\r\na one-hundred-and-ten-mile walk, where he thought he would eventually\r\n\r\nget a ship for the States.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the men in the line were not all of this calibre. Some\r\n\r\nwere poor, wretched beasts, inarticulate and callous, but for all of\r\n\r\nthat, in many ways very human. I remember a carter, evidently\r\n\r\nreturning home after the day\u2019s work, stopping his cart before\r\n\r\nus so that his young hopeful, who had run to meet him, could climb in.\r\n\r\nBut the cart was big, the young hopeful little, and he failed in his\r\n\r\nseveral attempts to swarm up. Whereupon one of the most degraded-looking\r\n\r\nmen stepped out of the line and hoisted him in. Now the virtue\r\n\r\nand the joy of this act lies in that it was service of love, not hire.\r\n\r\nThe carter was poor, and the man knew it; and the man was standing in\r\n\r\nthe spike line, and the carter knew it; and the man had done the little\r\n\r\nact, and the carter had thanked him, even as you and I would have done\r\n\r\nand thanked.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother beautiful touch was that displayed by the \u201cHopper\u201d\r\n\r\nand his \u201cole woman.\u201d He had been in line about half-an-hour\r\n\r\nwhen the \u201cole woman\u201d (his mate) came up to him. She\r\n\r\nwas fairly clad, for her class, with a weather-worn bonnet on her grey\r\n\r\nhead and a sacking-covered bundle in her arms. As she talked to\r\n\r\nhim, he reached forward, caught the one stray wisp of the white hair\r\n\r\nthat was flying wild, deftly twirled it between his fingers, and tucked\r\n\r\nit back properly behind her ear. From all of which one may conclude\r\n\r\nmany things. He certainly liked her well enough to wish her to\r\n\r\nbe neat and tidy. He was proud of her, standing there in the spike\r\n\r\nline, and it was his desire that she should look well in the eyes of\r\n\r\nthe other unfortunates who stood in the spike line. But last and\r\n\r\nbest, and underlying all these motives, it was a sturdy affection he\r\n\r\nbore her; for man is not prone to bother his head over neatness and\r\n\r\ntidiness in a woman for whom he does not care, nor is he likely to be\r\n\r\nproud of such a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I found myself questioning why this man and his mate, hard workers\r\n\r\nI knew from their talk, should have to seek a pauper lodging.\r\n\r\nHe had pride, pride in his old woman and pride in himself. When\r\n\r\nI asked him what he thought I, a greenhorn, might expect to earn at\r\n\r\n\u201chopping,\u201d he sized me up, and said that it all depended.\r\n\r\nPlenty of people were too slow to pick hops and made a failure of it.\r\n\r\nA man, to succeed, must use his head and be quick with his fingers,\r\n\r\nmust be exceeding quick with his fingers. Now he and his old woman\r\n\r\ncould do very well at it, working the one bin between them and not going\r\n\r\nto sleep over it; but then, they had been at it for years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI \u2019ad a mate as went down last year,\u201d spoke up\r\n\r\na man. \u201cIt was \u2019is fust time, but \u2019e come back\r\n\r\nwi\u2019 two poun\u2019 ten in \u2019is pockit, an\u2019 \u2019e\r\n\r\nwas only gone a month.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said the Hopper, a wealth of admiration\r\n\r\nin his voice. \u201c\u2019E was quick. \u2019E was jest\r\n\r\nnat\u2019rally born to it, \u2019e was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo pound ten\u2014twelve dollars and a half\u2014for a month\u2019s\r\n\r\nwork when one is \u201cjest nat\u2019rally born to it!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd in addition, sleeping out without blankets and living the Lord knows\r\n\r\nhow. There are moments when I am thankful that I was not \u201cjest\r\n\r\nnat\u2019rally born\u201d a genius for anything, not even hop-picking,\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the matter of getting an outfit for \u201cthe hops,\u201d the\r\n\r\nHopper gave me some sterling advice, to which same give heed, you soft\r\n\r\nand tender people, in case you should ever be stranded in London Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you ain\u2019t got tins an\u2019 cookin\u2019 things,\r\n\r\nall as you can get\u2019ll be bread and cheese. No bloomin\u2019\r\n\r\ngood that! You must \u2019ave \u2019ot tea, an\u2019 wegetables,\r\n\r\nan\u2019 a bit o\u2019 meat, now an\u2019 again, if you\u2019re\r\n\r\ngoin\u2019 to do work as is work. Cawn\u2019t do it on cold\r\n\r\nwittles. Tell you wot you do, lad. Run around in the mornin\u2019\r\n\r\nan\u2019 look in the dust pans. You\u2019ll find plenty o\u2019\r\n\r\ntins to cook in. Fine tins, wonderful good some o\u2019 them.\r\n\r\nMe an\u2019 the ole woman got ours that way.\u201d (He pointed\r\n\r\nat the bundle she held, while she nodded proudly, beaming on me with\r\n\r\ngood-nature and consciousness of success and prosperity.) \u201cThis\r\n\r\novercoat is as good as a blanket,\u201d he went on, advancing the skirt\r\n\r\nof it that I might feel its thickness. \u201cAn\u2019 \u2019oo\r\n\r\nknows, I may find a blanket before long.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain the old woman nodded and beamed, this time with the dead certainty\r\n\r\nthat he would find a blanket before long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI call it a \u2019oliday, \u2019oppin\u2019,\u201d he\r\n\r\nconcluded rapturously. \u201cA tidy way o\u2019 gettin\u2019\r\n\r\ntwo or three pounds together an\u2019 fixin\u2019 up for winter.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I don\u2019t like\u201d\u2014and here was the rift\r\n\r\nwithin the lute\u2014\u201cis paddin\u2019 the \u2019oof down there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was plain the years were telling on this energetic pair, and while\r\n\r\nthey enjoyed the quick work with the fingers, \u201cpaddin\u2019 the\r\n\r\n\u2019oof,\u201d which is walking, was beginning to bear heavily upon\r\n\r\nthem. And I looked at their grey hairs, and ahead into the future\r\n\r\nten years, and wondered how it would be with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI noticed another man and his old woman join the line, both of them\r\n\r\npast fifty. The woman, because she was a woman, was admitted into\r\n\r\nthe spike; but he was too late, and, separated from his mate, was turned\r\n\r\naway to tramp the streets all night.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe street on which we stood, from wall to wall, was barely twenty\r\n\r\nfeet wide. The sidewalks were three feet wide. It was a\r\n\r\nresidence street. At least workmen and their families existed\r\n\r\nin some sort of fashion in the houses across from us. And each\r\n\r\nday and every day, from one in the afternoon till six, our ragged spike\r\n\r\nline is the principal feature of the view commanded by their front doors\r\n\r\nand windows. One workman sat in his door directly opposite us,\r\n\r\ntaking his rest and a breath of air after the toil of the day.\r\n\r\nHis wife came to chat with him. The doorway was too small for\r\n\r\ntwo, so she stood up. Their babes sprawled before them.\r\n\r\nAnd here was the spike line, less than a score of feet away\u2014neither\r\n\r\nprivacy for the workman, nor privacy for the pauper. About our\r\n\r\nfeet played the children of the neighbourhood. To them our presence\r\n\r\nwas nothing unusual. We were not an intrusion. We were as\r\n\r\nnatural and ordinary as the brick walls and stone curbs of their environment.\r\n\r\nThey had been born to the sight of the spike line, and all their brief\r\n\r\ndays they had seen it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six o\u2019clock the line moved up, and we were admitted in groups\r\n\r\nof three. Name, age, occupation, place of birth, condition of\r\n\r\ndestitution, and the previous night\u2019s \u201cdoss,\u201d were\r\n\r\ntaken with lightning-like rapidity by the superintendent; and as I turned\r\n\r\nI was startled by a man\u2019s thrusting into my hand something that\r\n\r\nfelt like a brick, and shouting into my ear, \u201cany knives, matches,\r\n\r\nor tobacco?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d I lied, as lied every\r\n\r\nman who entered. As I passed downstairs to the cellar, I looked\r\n\r\nat the brick in my hand, and saw that by doing violence to the language\r\n\r\nit might be called \u201cbread.\u201d By its weight and hardness\r\n\r\nit certainly must have been unleavened.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light was very dim down in the cellar, and before I knew it some\r\n\r\nother man had thrust a pannikin into my other hand. Then I stumbled\r\n\r\non to a still darker room, where were benches and tables and men.\r\n\r\nThe place smelled vilely, and the sombre gloom, and the mumble of voices\r\n\r\nfrom out of the obscurity, made it seem more like some anteroom to the\r\n\r\ninfernal regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the men were suffering from tired feet, and they prefaced\r\n\r\nthe meal by removing their shoes and unbinding the filthy rags with\r\n\r\nwhich their feet were wrapped. This added to the general noisomeness,\r\n\r\nwhile it took away from my appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, I found that I had made a mistake. I had eaten a hearty\r\n\r\ndinner five hours before, and to have done justice to the fare before\r\n\r\nme I should have fasted for a couple of days. The pannikin contained\r\n\r\nskilly, three-quarters of a pint, a mixture of Indian corn and hot water.\r\n\r\nThe men were dipping their bread into heaps of salt scattered over the\r\n\r\ndirty tables. I attempted the same, but the bread seemed to stick\r\n\r\nin my mouth, and I remembered the words of the Carpenter, \u201cYou\r\n\r\nneed a pint of water to eat the bread nicely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI went over into a dark corner where I had observed other men going\r\n\r\nand found the water. Then I returned and attacked the skilly.\r\n\r\nIt was coarse of texture, unseasoned, gross, and bitter. This\r\n\r\nbitterness which lingered persistently in the mouth after the skilly\r\n\r\nhad passed on, I found especially repulsive. I struggled manfully,\r\n\r\nbut was mastered by my qualms, and half-a-dozen mouthfuls of skilly\r\n\r\nand bread was the measure of my success. The man beside me ate\r\n\r\nhis own share, and mine to boot, scraped the pannikins, and looked hungrily\r\n\r\nfor more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI met a \u2018towny,\u2019 and he stood me too good a dinner,\u201d\r\n\r\nI explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 I \u2019aven\u2019t \u2019ad a bite since yesterday\r\n\r\nmornin\u2019,\u201d he replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about tobacco?\u201d I asked. \u201cWill the bloke\r\n\r\nbother with a fellow now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d he answered me. \u201cNo bloomin\u2019\r\n\r\nfear. This is the easiest spike goin\u2019. Y\u2019oughto\r\n\r\nsee some of them. Search you to the skin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pannikins scraped clean, conversation began to spring up.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis super\u2019tendent \u2019ere is always writin\u2019 to\r\n\r\nthe papers \u2019bout us mugs,\u201d said the man on the other side\r\n\r\nof me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does he say?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, \u2019e sez we\u2019re no good, a lot o\u2019 blackguards\r\n\r\nan\u2019 scoundrels as won\u2019t work. Tells all the ole tricks\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve bin \u2019earin\u2019 for twenty years an\u2019 w\u2019ich\r\n\r\nI never seen a mug ever do. Las\u2019 thing of \u2019is I see,\r\n\r\n\u2019e was tellin\u2019 \u2019ow a mug gets out o\u2019 the spike,\r\n\r\nwi\u2019 a crust in \u2019is pockit. An\u2019 w\u2019en \u2019e\r\n\r\nsees a nice ole gentleman comin\u2019 along the street \u2019e chucks\r\n\r\nthe crust into the drain, an\u2019 borrows the old gent\u2019s stick\r\n\r\nto poke it out. An\u2019 then the ole gent gi\u2019es \u2019im\r\n\r\na tanner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA roar of applause greeted the time-honoured yarn, and from somewhere\r\n\r\nover in the deeper darkness came another voice, orating angrily:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTalk o\u2019 the country bein\u2019 good for tommy [food];\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to see it. I jest came up from Dover, an\u2019\r\n\r\nblessed little tommy I got. They won\u2019t gi\u2019 ye a drink\r\n\r\no\u2019 water, they won\u2019t, much less tommy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s mugs never go out of Kent,\u201d spoke a second\r\n\r\nvoice, \u201cthey live bloomin\u2019 fat all along.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI come through Kent,\u201d went on the first voice, still\r\n\r\nmore angrily, \u201can\u2019 Gawd blimey if I see any tommy.\r\n\r\nAn\u2019 I always notices as the blokes as talks about \u2019ow much\r\n\r\nthey can get, w\u2019en they\u2019re in the spike can eat my share\r\n\r\no\u2019 skilly as well as their bleedin\u2019 own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s chaps in London,\u201d said a man across the\r\n\r\ntable from me, \u201cthat get all the tommy they want, an\u2019 they\r\n\r\nnever think o\u2019 goin\u2019 to the country. Stay in London\r\n\r\nthe year \u2019round. Nor do they think of lookin\u2019 for\r\n\r\na kip [place to sleep], till nine or ten o\u2019clock at night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA general chorus verified this statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they\u2019re bloomin\u2019 clever, them chaps,\u201d\r\n\r\nsaid an admiring voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCourse they are,\u201d said another voice. \u201cBut\r\n\r\nit\u2019s not the likes of me an\u2019 you can do it. You got\r\n\r\nto be born to it, I say. Them chaps \u2019ave ben openin\u2019\r\n\r\ncabs an\u2019 sellin\u2019 papers since the day they was born, an\u2019\r\n\r\ntheir fathers an\u2019 mothers before \u2019em. It\u2019s all\r\n\r\nin the trainin\u2019, I say, an\u2019 the likes of me an\u2019 you\r\n\r\n\u2019ud starve at it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also was verified by the general chorus, and likewise the statement\r\n\r\nthat there were \u201cmugs as lives the twelvemonth \u2019round in\r\n\r\nthe spike an\u2019 never get a blessed bit o\u2019 tommy other than\r\n\r\nspike skilly an\u2019 bread.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI once got arf a crown in the Stratford spike,\u201d said\r\n\r\na new voice. Silence fell on the instant, and all listened to\r\n\r\nthe wonderful tale. \u201cThere was three of us breakin\u2019\r\n\r\nstones. Winter-time, an\u2019 the cold was cruel. T\u2019other\r\n\r\ntwo said they\u2019d be blessed if they do it, an\u2019 they didn\u2019t;\r\n\r\nbut I kept wearin\u2019 into mine to warm up, you know. An\u2019\r\n\r\nthen the guardians come, an\u2019 t\u2019other chaps got run in for\r\n\r\nfourteen days, an\u2019 the guardians, w\u2019en they see wot I\u2019d\r\n\r\nbeen doin\u2019, gives me a tanner each, five o\u2019 them, an\u2019\r\n\r\nturns me up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of these men, nay, all of them, I found, do not like\r\n\r\nthe spike, and only come to it when driven in. After the \u201crest\r\n\r\nup\u201d they are good for two or three days and nights on the streets,\r\n\r\nwhen they are driven in again for another rest. Of course, this\r\n\r\ncontinuous hardship quickly breaks their constitutions, and they realise\r\n\r\nit, though only in a vague way; while it is so much the common run of\r\n\r\nthings that they do not worry about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the doss,\u201d they call vagabondage here, which corresponds\r\n\r\nto \u201con the road\u201d in the United States. The agreement\r\n\r\nis that kipping, or dossing, or sleeping, is the hardest problem they\r\n\r\nhave to face, harder even than that of food. The inclement weather\r\n\r\nand the harsh laws are mainly responsible for this, while the men themselves\r\n\r\nascribe their homelessness to foreign immigration, especially of Polish\r\n\r\nand Russian Jews, who take their places at lower wages and establish\r\n\r\nthe sweating system.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy seven o\u2019clock we were called away to bathe and go to bed.\r\n\r\nWe stripped our clothes, wrapping them up in our coats and buckling\r\n\r\nour belts about them, and deposited them in a heaped rack and on the\r\n\r\nfloor\u2014a beautiful scheme for the spread of vermin. Then,\r\n\r\ntwo by two, we entered the bathroom. There were two ordinary tubs,\r\n\r\nand this I know: the two men preceding had washed in that water, we\r\n\r\nwashed in the same water, and it was not changed for the two men that\r\n\r\nfollowed us. This I know; but I am also certain that the twenty-two\r\n\r\nof us washed in the same water.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did no more than make a show of splashing some of this dubious\r\n\r\nliquid at myself, while I hastily brushed it off with a towel wet from\r\n\r\nthe bodies of other men. My equanimity was not restored by seeing\r\n\r\nthe back of one poor wretch a mass of blood from attacks of vermin and\r\n\r\nretaliatory scratching.\r\n\r\n\r\nA shirt was handed me\u2014which I could not help but wonder how\r\n\r\nmany other men had worn; and with a couple of blankets under my arm\r\n\r\nI trudged off to the sleeping apartment. This was a long, narrow\r\n\r\nroom, traversed by two low iron rails. Between these rails were\r\n\r\nstretched, not hammocks, but pieces of canvas, six feet long and less\r\n\r\nthan two feet wide. These were the beds, and they were six inches\r\n\r\napart and about eight inches above the floor. The chief difficulty\r\n\r\nwas that the head was somewhat higher than the feet, which caused the\r\n\r\nbody constantly to slip down. Being slung to the same rails, when\r\n\r\none man moved, no matter how slightly, the rest were set rocking; and\r\n\r\nwhenever I dozed somebody was sure to struggle back to the position\r\n\r\nfrom which he had slipped, and arouse me again.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany hours passed before I won to sleep. It was only seven\r\n\r\nin the evening, and the voices of children, in shrill outcry, playing\r\n\r\nin the street, continued till nearly midnight. The smell was frightful\r\n\r\nand sickening, while my imagination broke loose, and my skin crept and\r\n\r\ncrawled till I was nearly frantic. Grunting, groaning, and snoring\r\n\r\narose like the sounds emitted by some sea monster, and several times,\r\n\r\nafflicted by nightmare, one or another, by his shrieks and yells, aroused\r\n\r\nthe lot of us. Toward morning I was awakened by a rat or some\r\n\r\nsimilar animal on my breast. In the quick transition from sleep\r\n\r\nto waking, before I was completely myself, I raised a shout to wake\r\n\r\nthe dead. At any rate, I woke the living, and they cursed me roundly\r\n\r\nfor my lack of manners.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut morning came, with a six o\u2019clock breakfast of bread and\r\n\r\nskilly, which I gave away, and we were told off to our various tasks.\r\n\r\nSome were set to scrubbing and cleaning, others to picking oakum, and\r\n\r\neight of us were convoyed across the street to the Whitechapel Infirmary\r\n\r\nwhere we were set at scavenger work. This was the method by which\r\n\r\nwe paid for our skilly and canvas, and I, for one, know that I paid\r\n\r\nin full many times over.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough we had most revolting tasks to perform, our allotment was\r\n\r\nconsidered the best and the other men deemed themselves lucky in being\r\n\r\nchosen to perform it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it, mate, the nurse sez it\u2019s deadly,\u201d\r\n\r\nwarned my working partner, as I held open a sack into which he was emptying\r\n\r\na garbage can.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt came from the sick wards, and I told him that I purposed neither\r\n\r\nto touch it, nor to allow it to touch me. Nevertheless, I had\r\n\r\nto carry the sack, and other sacks, down five flights of stairs and\r\n\r\nempty them in a receptacle where the corruption was speedily sprinkled\r\n\r\nwith strong disinfectant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a wise mercy in all this. These men of the\r\n\r\nspike, the peg, and the street, are encumbrances. They are of\r\n\r\nno good or use to any one, nor to themselves. They clutter the\r\n\r\nearth with their presence, and are better out of the way. Broken\r\n\r\nby hardship, ill fed, and worse nourished, they are always the first\r\n\r\nto be struck down by disease, as they are likewise the quickest to die.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey feel, themselves, that the forces of society tend to hurl them out of\r\n\r\nexistence. We were sprinkling disinfectant by the mortuary, when the dead\r\n\r\nwaggon drove up and five bodies were packed into it. The conversation turned to\r\n\r\nthe \u201cwhite potion\u201d and \u201cblack jack,\u201d and I found they\r\n\r\nwere all agreed that the poor person, man or woman, who in the Infirmary gave\r\n\r\ntoo much trouble or was in a bad way, was \u201cpolished off.\u201d That is\r\n\r\nto say, the incurables and the obstreperous were given a dose of \u201cblack\r\n\r\njack\u201d or the \u201cwhite potion,\u201d and sent over the divide. It\r\n\r\ndoes not matter in the least whether this be actually so or not. The point is,\r\n\r\nthey have the feeling that it is so, and they have created the language with\r\n\r\nwhich to express that feeling\u2014\u201cblack jack,\u201d \u201cwhite\r\n\r\npotion,\u201d \u201cpolishing off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt eight o\u2019clock we went down into a cellar under the infirmary,\r\n\r\nwhere tea was brought to us, and the hospital scraps. These were\r\n\r\nheaped high on a huge platter in an indescribable mess\u2014pieces\r\n\r\nof bread, chunks of grease and fat pork, the burnt skin from the outside\r\n\r\nof roasted joints, bones, in short, all the leavings from the fingers\r\n\r\nand mouths of the sick ones suffering from all manner of diseases.\r\n\r\nInto this mess the men plunged their hands, digging, pawing, turning\r\n\r\nover, examining, rejecting, and scrambling for. It wasn\u2019t\r\n\r\npretty. Pigs couldn\u2019t have done worse. But the poor\r\n\r\ndevils were hungry, and they ate ravenously of the swill, and when they\r\n\r\ncould eat no more they bundled what was left into their handkerchiefs\r\n\r\nand thrust it inside their shirts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce, w\u2019en I was \u2019ere before, wot did I find out\r\n\r\nthere but a \u2019ole lot of pork-ribs,\u201d said Ginger to me.\r\n\r\nBy \u201cout there\u201d he meant the place where the corruption was\r\n\r\ndumped and sprinkled with strong disinfectant. \u201cThey was\r\n\r\na prime lot, no end o\u2019 meat on \u2019em, an\u2019 I \u2019ad\r\n\r\n\u2019em into my arms an\u2019 was out the gate an\u2019 down the\r\n\r\nstreet, a-lookin\u2019 for some \u2019un to gi\u2019 \u2019em to.\r\n\r\nCouldn\u2019t see a soul, an\u2019 I was runnin\u2019 \u2019round\r\n\r\nclean crazy, the bloke runnin\u2019 after me an\u2019 thinkin\u2019\r\n\r\nI was \u2018slingin\u2019 my \u2019ook\u2019 [running away].\r\n\r\nBut jest before \u2019e got me, I got a ole woman an\u2019 poked \u2019em\r\n\r\ninto \u2019er apron.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nO Charity, O Philanthropy, descend to the spike and take a lesson\r\n\r\nfrom Ginger. At the bottom of the Abyss he performed as purely\r\n\r\nan altruistic act as was ever performed outside the Abyss. It\r\n\r\nwas fine of Ginger, and if the old woman caught some contagion from\r\n\r\nthe \u201cno end o\u2019 meat\u201d on the pork-ribs, it was still\r\n\r\nfine, though not so fine. But the most salient thing in this incident,\r\n\r\nit seems to me, is poor Ginger, \u201cclean crazy\u201d at sight of\r\n\r\nso much food going to waste.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the rule of the casual ward that a man who enters must stay\r\n\r\ntwo nights and a day; but I had seen sufficient for my purpose, had\r\n\r\npaid for my skilly and canvas, and was preparing to run for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s sling it,\u201d I said to one of my\r\n\r\nmates, pointing toward the open gate through which the dead waggon had\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 get fourteen days?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; get away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAw, I come \u2019ere for a rest,\u201d he said complacently.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 another night\u2019s kip won\u2019t \u2019urt me\r\n\r\nnone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were all of this opinion, so I was forced to \u201csling it\u201d\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou cawn\u2019t ever come back \u2019ere again for a doss,\u201d\r\n\r\nthey warned me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo fear,\u201d said I, with an enthusiasm they could not\r\n\r\ncomprehend; and, dodging out the gate, I sped down the street.\r\n\r\n\r\nStraight to my room I hurried, changed my clothes, and less than\r\n\r\nan hour from my escape, in a Turkish bath, I was sweating out whatever\r\n\r\ngerms and other things had penetrated my epidermis, and wishing that\r\n\r\nI could stand a temperature of three hundred and twenty rather than\r\n\r\ntwo hundred and twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCARRYING THE BANNER\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTo carry the banner\u201d means to walk the streets all night;\r\n\r\nand I, with the figurative emblem hoisted, went out to see what I could\r\n\r\nsee. Men and women walk the streets at night all over this great\r\n\r\ncity, but I selected the West End, making Leicester Square my base,\r\n\r\nand scouting about from the Thames Embankment to Hyde Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain was falling heavily when the theatres let out, and the brilliant\r\n\r\nthrong which poured from the places of amusement was hard put to find cabs. The\r\n\r\nstreets were so many wild rivers of cabs, most of which were engaged, however;\r\n\r\nand here I saw the desperate attempts of ragged men and boys to get a shelter\r\n\r\nfrom the night by procuring cabs for the cabless ladies and gentlemen. I use\r\n\r\nthe word \u201cdesperate\u201d advisedly, for these wretched, homeless ones\r\n\r\nwere gambling a soaking against a bed; and most of them, I took notice, got the\r\n\r\nsoaking and missed the bed. Now, to go through a stormy night with wet clothes,\r\n\r\nand, in addition, to be ill nourished and not to have tasted meat for a week or\r\n\r\na month, is about as severe a hardship as a man can undergo. Well fed and well\r\n\r\nclad, I have travelled all day with the spirit thermometer down to seventy-four\r\n\r\ndegrees below zero\u2014one hundred and six degrees of frost[1];\r\n\r\nand though I suffered, it was a mere nothing compared with carrying the banner\r\n\r\nfor a night, ill fed, ill clad, and soaking wet.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1]\r\n\r\nThis in the Klondike.\u2014J. L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe streets grew very quiet and lonely after the theatre crowd had\r\n\r\ngone home. Only were to be seen the ubiquitous policemen, flashing\r\n\r\ntheir dark lanterns into doorways and alleys, and men and women and\r\n\r\nboys taking shelter in the lee of buildings from the wind and rain.\r\n\r\nPiccadilly, however, was not quite so deserted. Its pavements\r\n\r\nwere brightened by well-dressed women without escort, and there was\r\n\r\nmore life and action there than elsewhere, due to the process of finding\r\n\r\nescort. But by three o\u2019clock the last of them had vanished,\r\n\r\nand it was then indeed lonely.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past one the steady downpour ceased, and only showers fell\r\n\r\nthereafter. The homeless folk came away from the protection of\r\n\r\nthe buildings, and slouched up and down and everywhere, in order to\r\n\r\nrush up the circulation and keep warm.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne old woman, between fifty and sixty, a sheer wreck, I had noticed\r\n\r\nearlier in the night standing in Piccadilly, not far from Leicester\r\n\r\nSquare. She seemed to have neither the sense nor the strength\r\n\r\nto get out of the rain or keep walking, but stood stupidly, whenever\r\n\r\nshe got the chance, meditating on past days, I imagine, when life was\r\n\r\nyoung and blood was warm. But she did not get the chance often.\r\n\r\nShe was moved on by every policeman, and it required an average of six\r\n\r\nmoves to send her doddering off one man\u2019s beat and on to another\u2019s.\r\n\r\nBy three o\u2019clock, she had progressed as far as St. James Street,\r\n\r\nand as the clocks were striking four I saw her sleeping soundly against\r\n\r\nthe iron railings of Green Park. A brisk shower was falling at\r\n\r\nthe time, and she must have been drenched to the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, said I, at one o\u2019clock, to myself; consider that you are\r\n\r\na poor young man, penniless, in London Town, and that to-morrow you\r\n\r\nmust look for work. It is necessary, therefore, that you get some\r\n\r\nsleep in order that you may have strength to look for work and to do\r\n\r\nwork in case you find it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I sat down on the stone steps of a building. Five minutes\r\n\r\nlater a policeman was looking at me. My eyes were wide open, so\r\n\r\nhe only grunted and passed on. Ten minutes later my head was on\r\n\r\nmy knees, I was dozing, and the same policeman was saying gruffly, \u201c\u2019Ere,\r\n\r\nyou, get outa that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI got. And, like the old woman, I continued to get; for every\r\n\r\ntime I dozed, a policeman was there to rout me along again. Not\r\n\r\nlong after, when I had given this up, I was walking with a young Londoner\r\n\r\n(who had been out to the colonies and wished he were out to them again),\r\n\r\nwhen I noticed an open passage leading under a building and disappearing\r\n\r\nin darkness. A low iron gate barred the entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s climb over\r\n\r\nand get a good sleep.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWot?\u201d he answered, recoiling from me. \u201cAn\u2019\r\n\r\nget run in fer three months! Blimey if I do!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nLater on I was passing Hyde Park with a young boy of fourteen or\r\n\r\nfifteen, a most wretched-looking youth, gaunt and hollow-eyed and sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go over the fence,\u201d I proposed, \u201cand\r\n\r\ncrawl into the shrubbery for a sleep. The bobbies couldn\u2019t\r\n\r\nfind us there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo fear,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere\u2019s the\r\n\r\npark guardians, and they\u2019d run you in for six months.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nTimes have changed, alas! When I was a youngster I used to\r\n\r\nread of homeless boys sleeping in doorways. Already the thing\r\n\r\nhas become a tradition. As a stock situation it will doubtless\r\n\r\nlinger in literature for a century to come, but as a cold fact it has\r\n\r\nceased to be. Here are the doorways, and here are the boys, but\r\n\r\nhappy conjunctions are no longer effected. The doorways remain\r\n\r\nempty, and the boys keep awake and carry the banner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI was down under the arches,\u201d grumbled another young\r\n\r\nfellow. By \u201carches\u201d he meant the shore arches where\r\n\r\nbegin the bridges that span the Thames. \u201cI was down under\r\n\r\nthe arches wen it was ryning its \u2019ardest, an\u2019 a bobby comes\r\n\r\nin an\u2019 chyses me out. But I come back, an\u2019 \u2019e\r\n\r\ncome too. \u2018\u2019Ere,\u2019 sez \u2019e, \u2018wot you\r\n\r\ndoin\u2019 \u2019ere?\u2019 An\u2019 out I goes, but I sez,\r\n\r\n\u2018Think I want ter pinch [steal] the bleedin\u2019 bridge?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong those who carry the banner, Green Park has the reputation of\r\n\r\nopening its gates earlier than the other parks, and at quarter-past\r\n\r\nfour in the morning, I, and many more, entered Green Park. It\r\n\r\nwas raining again, but they were worn out with the night\u2019s walking,\r\n\r\nand they were down on the benches and asleep at once. Many of\r\n\r\nthe men stretched out full length on the dripping wet grass, and, with\r\n\r\nthe rain falling steadily upon them, were sleeping the sleep of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now I wish to criticise the powers that be. They are\r\n\r\nthe powers, therefore they may decree whatever they please; so I make\r\n\r\nbold only to criticise the ridiculousness of their decrees. All\r\n\r\nnight long they make the homeless ones walk up and down. They\r\n\r\ndrive them out of doors and passages, and lock them out of the parks.\r\n\r\nThe evident intention of all this is to deprive them of sleep.\r\n\r\nWell and good, the powers have the power to deprive them of sleep, or\r\n\r\nof anything else for that matter; but why under the sun do they open\r\n\r\nthe gates of the parks at five o\u2019clock in the morning and let\r\n\r\nthe homeless ones go inside and sleep? If it is their intention\r\n\r\nto deprive them of sleep, why do they let them sleep after five in the\r\n\r\nmorning? And if it is not their intention to deprive them of sleep,\r\n\r\nwhy don\u2019t they let them sleep earlier in the night?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this connection, I will say that I came by Green Park that same\r\n\r\nday, at one in the afternoon, and that I counted scores of the ragged\r\n\r\nwretches asleep in the grass. It was Sunday afternoon, the sun\r\n\r\nwas fitfully appearing, and the well-dressed West Enders, with their\r\n\r\nwives and progeny, were out by thousands, taking the air. It was\r\n\r\nnot a pleasant sight for them, those horrible, unkempt, sleeping vagabonds;\r\n\r\nwhile the vagabonds themselves, I know, would rather have done their\r\n\r\nsleeping the night before.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so, dear soft people, should you ever visit London Town, and\r\n\r\nsee these men asleep on the benches and in the grass, please do not\r\n\r\nthink they are lazy creatures, preferring sleep to work. Know\r\n\r\nthat the powers that be have kept them walking all the night long, and\r\n\r\nthat in the day they have nowhere else to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE PEG\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, after carrying the banner all night, I did not sleep in Green\r\n\r\nPark when morning dawned. I was wet to the skin, it is true, and\r\n\r\nI had had no sleep for twenty-four hours; but, still adventuring as\r\n\r\na penniless man looking for work, I had to look about me, first for\r\n\r\na breakfast, and next for the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night I had heard of a place over on the Surrey side of\r\n\r\nthe Thames, where the Salvation Army every Sunday morning gave away\r\n\r\na breakfast to the unwashed. (And, by the way, the men who carry\r\n\r\nthe banner are unwashed in the morning, and unless it is raining they\r\n\r\ndo not have much show for a wash, either.) This, thought I, is\r\n\r\nthe very thing\u2014breakfast in the morning, and then the whole day\r\n\r\nin which to look for work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a weary walk. Down St. James Street I dragged my tired\r\n\r\nlegs, along Pall Mall, past Trafalgar Square, to the Strand. I\r\n\r\ncrossed the Waterloo Bridge to the Surrey side, cut across to Blackfriars\r\n\r\nRoad, coming out near the Surrey Theatre, and arrived at the Salvation\r\n\r\nArmy barracks before seven o\u2019clock. This was \u201cthe\r\n\r\npeg.\u201d And by \u201cthe peg,\u201d in the argot, is meant\r\n\r\nthe place where a free meal may be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere was a motley crowd of woebegone wretches who had spent the night\r\n\r\nin the rain. Such prodigious misery! and so much of it!\r\n\r\nOld men, young men, all manner of men, and boys to boot, and all manner\r\n\r\nof boys. Some were drowsing standing up; half a score of them\r\n\r\nwere stretched out on the stone steps in most painful postures, all\r\n\r\nof them sound asleep, the skin of their bodies showing red through the\r\n\r\nholes, and rents in their rags. And up and down the street and\r\n\r\nacross the street for a block either way, each doorstep had from two\r\n\r\nto three occupants, all asleep, their heads bent forward on their knees.\r\n\r\nAnd, it must be remembered, these are not hard times in England.\r\n\r\nThings are going on very much as they ordinarily do, and times are neither\r\n\r\nhard nor easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then came the policeman. \u201cGet outa that, you bloomin\u2019\r\n\r\nswine! Eigh! eigh! Get out now!\u201d And like swine\r\n\r\nhe drove them from the doorways and scattered them to the four winds\r\n\r\nof Surrey. But when he encountered the crowd asleep on the steps\r\n\r\nhe was astounded. \u201cShocking!\u201d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cShocking! And of a Sunday morning! A pretty sight!\r\n\r\nEigh! eigh! Get outa that, you bleeding nuisances!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course it was a shocking sight, I was shocked myself. And\r\n\r\nI should not care to have my own daughter pollute her eyes with such\r\n\r\na sight, or come within half a mile of it; but\u2014and there we were,\r\n\r\nand there you are, and \u201cbut\u201d is all that can be said.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policeman passed on, and back we clustered, like flies around\r\n\r\na honey jar. For was there not that wonderful thing, a breakfast,\r\n\r\nawaiting us? We could not have clustered more persistently and\r\n\r\ndesperately had they been giving away million-dollar bank-notes.\r\n\r\nSome were already off to sleep, when back came the policeman and away\r\n\r\nwe scattered only to return again as soon as the coast was clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven a little door opened, and a Salvation Army soldier\r\n\r\nstuck out his head. \u201cAyn\u2019t no sense blockin\u2019\r\n\r\nthe wy up that wy,\u201d he said. \u201cThose as \u2019as tickets\r\n\r\ncawn come hin now, an\u2019 those as \u2019asn\u2019t cawn\u2019t\r\n\r\ncome hin till nine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, that breakfast! Nine o\u2019clock! An hour and a\r\n\r\nhalf longer! The men who held tickets were greatly envied.\r\n\r\nThey were permitted to go inside, have a wash, and sit down and rest\r\n\r\nuntil breakfast, while we waited for the same breakfast on the street.\r\n\r\nThe tickets had been distributed the previous night on the streets and\r\n\r\nalong the Embankment, and the possession of them was not a matter of\r\n\r\nmerit, but of chance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt eight-thirty, more men with tickets were admitted, and by nine\r\n\r\nthe little gate was opened to us. We crushed through somehow,\r\n\r\nand found ourselves packed in a courtyard like sardines. On more\r\n\r\noccasions than one, as a Yankee tramp in Yankeeland, I have had to work\r\n\r\nfor my breakfast; but for no breakfast did I ever work so hard as for\r\n\r\nthis one. For over two hours I had waited outside, and for over\r\n\r\nanother hour I waited in this packed courtyard. I had had nothing\r\n\r\nto eat all night, and I was weak and faint, while the smell of the soiled\r\n\r\nclothes and unwashed bodies, steaming from pent animal heat, and blocked\r\n\r\nsolidly about me, nearly turned my stomach. So tightly were we\r\n\r\npacked, that a number of the men took advantage of the opportunity and\r\n\r\nwent soundly asleep standing up.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, about the Salvation Army in general I know nothing, and whatever\r\n\r\ncriticism I shall make here is of that particular portion of the Salvation\r\n\r\nArmy which does business on Blackfriars Road near the Surrey Theatre.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this forcing of men who have been up all night to\r\n\r\nstand on their feet for hours longer, is as cruel as it is needless.\r\n\r\nWe were weak, famished, and exhausted from our night\u2019s hardship\r\n\r\nand lack of sleep, and yet there we stood, and stood, and stood, without\r\n\r\nrhyme or reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nSailors were very plentiful in this crowd. It seemed to me\r\n\r\nthat one man in four was looking for a ship, and I found at least a\r\n\r\ndozen of them to be American sailors. In accounting for their\r\n\r\nbeing \u201con the beach,\u201d I received the same story from each\r\n\r\nand all, and from my knowledge of sea affairs this story rang true.\r\n\r\nEnglish ships sign their sailors for the voyage, which means the round\r\n\r\ntrip, sometimes lasting as long as three years; and they cannot sign\r\n\r\noff and receive their discharges until they reach the home port, which\r\n\r\nis England. Their wages are low, their food is bad, and their\r\n\r\ntreatment worse. Very often they are really forced by their captains\r\n\r\nto desert in the New World or the colonies, leaving a handsome sum of\r\n\r\nwages behind them\u2014a distinct gain, either to the captain or the\r\n\r\nowners, or to both. But whether for this reason alone or not,\r\n\r\nit is a fact that large numbers of them desert. Then, for the\r\n\r\nhome voyage, the ship engages whatever sailors it can find on the beach.\r\n\r\nThese men are engaged at the somewhat higher wages that obtain in other\r\n\r\nportions of the world, under the agreement that they shall sign off\r\n\r\non reaching England. The reason for this is obvious; for it would\r\n\r\nbe poor business policy to sign them for any longer time, since seamen\u2019s\r\n\r\nwages are low in England, and England is always crowded with sailormen\r\n\r\non the beach. So this fully accounted for the American seamen\r\n\r\nat the Salvation Army barracks. To get off the beach in other\r\n\r\noutlandish places they had come to England, and gone on the beach in\r\n\r\nthe most outlandish place of all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were fully a score of Americans in the crowd, the non-sailors\r\n\r\nbeing \u201ctramps royal,\u201d the men whose \u201cmate is the wind\r\n\r\nthat tramps the world.\u201d They were all cheerful, facing things\r\n\r\nwith the pluck which is their chief characteristic and which seems never\r\n\r\nto desert them, withal they were cursing the country with lurid metaphors\r\n\r\nquite refreshing after a month of unimaginative, monotonous Cockney\r\n\r\nswearing. The Cockney has one oath, and one oath only, the most\r\n\r\nindecent in the language, which he uses on any and every occasion.\r\n\r\nFar different is the luminous and varied Western swearing, which runs\r\n\r\nto blasphemy rather than indecency. And after all, since men will\r\n\r\nswear, I think I prefer blasphemy to indecency; there is an audacity\r\n\r\nabout it, an adventurousness and defiance that is better than sheer\r\n\r\nfilthiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one American tramp royal whom I found particularly enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI first noticed him on the street, asleep in a doorway, his head on\r\n\r\nhis knees, but a hat on his head that one does not meet this side of\r\n\r\nthe Western Ocean. When the policeman routed him out, he got up\r\n\r\nslowly and deliberately, looked at the policeman, yawned and stretched\r\n\r\nhimself, looked at the policeman again as much as to say he didn\u2019t\r\n\r\nknow whether he would or wouldn\u2019t, and then sauntered leisurely\r\n\r\ndown the sidewalk. At the outset I was sure of the hat, but this\r\n\r\nmade me sure of the wearer of the hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the jam inside I found myself alongside of him, and we had quite\r\n\r\na chat. He had been through Spain, Italy, Switzerland, and France,\r\n\r\nand had accomplished the practically impossible feat of beating his\r\n\r\nway three hundred miles on a French railway without being caught at\r\n\r\nthe finish. Where was I hanging out? he asked. And how did\r\n\r\nI manage for \u201ckipping\u201d?\u2014which means sleeping.\r\n\r\nDid I know the rounds yet? He was getting on, though the country\r\n\r\nwas \u201chorstyl\u201d and the cities were \u201cbum.\u201d\r\n\r\nFierce, wasn\u2019t it? Couldn\u2019t \u201cbatter\u201d (beg)\r\n\r\nanywhere without being \u201cpinched.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t\r\n\r\ngoing to quit it. Buffalo Bill\u2019s Show was coming over soon,\r\n\r\nand a man who could drive eight horses was sure of a job any time.\r\n\r\nThese mugs over here didn\u2019t know beans about driving anything\r\n\r\nmore than a span. What was the matter with me hanging on and waiting\r\n\r\nfor Buffalo Bill? He was sure I could ring in somehow.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so, after all, blood is thicker than water. We were fellow-countrymen\r\n\r\nand strangers in a strange land. I had warmed to his battered\r\n\r\nold hat at sight of it, and he was as solicitous for my welfare as if\r\n\r\nwe were blood brothers. We swapped all manner of useful information\r\n\r\nconcerning the country and the ways of its people, methods by which\r\n\r\nto obtain food and shelter and what not, and we parted genuinely sorry\r\n\r\nat having to say good-bye.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing particularly conspicuous in this crowd was the shortness\r\n\r\nof stature. I, who am but of medium height, looked over the heads\r\n\r\nof nine out of ten. The natives were all short, as were the foreign\r\n\r\nsailors. There were only five or six in the crowd who could be\r\n\r\ncalled fairly tall, and they were Scandinavians and Americans.\r\n\r\nThe tallest man there, however, was an exception. He was an Englishman,\r\n\r\nthough not a Londoner. \u201cCandidate for the Life Guards,\u201d\r\n\r\nI remarked to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve hit it, mate,\u201d was\r\n\r\nhis reply; \u201cI\u2019ve served my bit in that same, and the way\r\n\r\nthings are I\u2019ll be back at it before long.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nFor an hour we stood quietly in this packed courtyard. Then\r\n\r\nthe men began to grow restless. There was pushing and shoving\r\n\r\nforward, and a mild hubbub of voices. Nothing rough, however,\r\n\r\nnor violent; merely the restlessness of weary and hungry men.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture forth came the adjutant. I did not like him.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were not good. There was nothing of the lowly Galilean\r\n\r\nabout him, but a great deal of the centurion who said: \u201cFor I\r\n\r\nam a man in authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this man,\r\n\r\nGo, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant,\r\n\r\nDo this, and he doeth it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, he looked at us in just that way, and those nearest to him\r\n\r\nquailed. Then he lifted his voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cStop this \u2019ere, now, or I\u2019ll turn you the other\r\n\r\nwy an\u2019 march you out, an\u2019 you\u2019ll get no breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot convey by printed speech the insufferable way in which he\r\n\r\nsaid this. He seemed to me to revel in that he was a man in authority,\r\n\r\nable to say to half a thousand ragged wretches, \u201cyou may eat or\r\n\r\ngo hungry, as I elect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nTo deny us our breakfast after standing for hours! It was an\r\n\r\nawful threat, and the pitiful, abject silence which instantly fell attested\r\n\r\nits awfulness. And it was a cowardly threat. We could not\r\n\r\nstrike back, for we were starving; and it is the way of the world that\r\n\r\nwhen one man feeds another he is that man\u2019s master. But\r\n\r\nthe centurion\u2014I mean the adjutant\u2014was not satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn the dead silence he raised his voice again, and repeated the threat,\r\n\r\nand amplified it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last we were permitted to enter the feasting hall, where we found\r\n\r\nthe \u201cticket men\u201d washed but unfed. All told, there\r\n\r\nmust have been nearly seven hundred of us who sat down\u2014not to\r\n\r\nmeat or bread, but to speech, song, and prayer. From all of which\r\n\r\nI am convinced that Tantalus suffers in many guises this side of the\r\n\r\ninfernal regions. The adjutant made the prayer, but I did not\r\n\r\ntake note of it, being too engrossed with the massed picture of misery\r\n\r\nbefore me. But the speech ran something like this: \u201cYou\r\n\r\nwill feast in Paradise. No matter how you starve and suffer here,\r\n\r\nyou will feast in Paradise, that is, if you will follow the directions.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so forth and so forth. A clever bit of propaganda, I took\r\n\r\nit, but rendered of no avail for two reasons. First, the men who\r\n\r\nreceived it were unimaginative and materialistic, unaware of the existence\r\n\r\nof any Unseen, and too inured to hell on earth to be frightened by hell\r\n\r\nto come. And second, weary and exhausted from the night\u2019s\r\n\r\nsleeplessness and hardship, suffering from the long wait upon their\r\n\r\nfeet, and faint from hunger, they were yearning, not for salvation,\r\n\r\nbut for grub. The \u201csoul-snatchers\u201d (as these men call\r\n\r\nall religious propagandists), should study the physiological basis of\r\n\r\npsychology a little, if they wish to make their efforts more effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in good time, about eleven o\u2019clock, breakfast arrived.\r\n\r\nIt arrived, not on plates, but in paper parcels. I did not have\r\n\r\nall I wanted, and I am sure that no man there had all he wanted, or\r\n\r\nhalf of what he wanted or needed. I gave part of my bread to the\r\n\r\ntramp royal who was waiting for Buffalo Bill, and he was as ravenous\r\n\r\nat the end as he was in the beginning. This is the breakfast:\r\n\r\ntwo slices of bread, one small piece of bread with raisins in it and\r\n\r\ncalled \u201ccake,\u201d a wafer of cheese, and a mug of \u201cwater\r\n\r\nbewitched.\u201d Numbers of the men had been waiting since five\r\n\r\no\u2019clock for it, while all of us had waited at least four hours;\r\n\r\nand in addition, we had been herded like swine, packed like sardines,\r\n\r\nand treated like curs, and been preached at, and sung to, and prayed\r\n\r\nfor. Nor was that all.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner was breakfast over (and it was over almost as quickly as\r\n\r\nit takes to tell), than the tired heads began to nod and droop, and\r\n\r\nin five minutes half of us were sound asleep. There were no signs\r\n\r\nof our being dismissed, while there were unmistakable signs of preparation\r\n\r\nfor a meeting. I looked at a small clock hanging on the wall.\r\n\r\nIt indicated twenty-five minutes to twelve. Heigh-ho, thought\r\n\r\nI, time is flying, and I have yet to look for work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to go,\u201d I said to a couple of waking men near\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cGot ter sty fer the service,\u201d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you want to stay?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us go and tell them we want to get out,\u201d I\r\n\r\ncontinued. \u201cCome on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the poor creatures were aghast. So I left them to their\r\n\r\nfate, and went up to the nearest Salvation Army man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to go,\u201d I said. \u201cI came here for\r\n\r\nbreakfast in order that I might be in shape to look for work.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t think it would take so long to get breakfast. I\r\n\r\nthink I have a chance for work in Stepney, and the sooner I start, the\r\n\r\nbetter chance I\u2019ll have of getting it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was really a good fellow, though he was startled by my request.\r\n\r\n\u201cWy,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re goin\u2019 to \u2019old\r\n\r\nservices, and you\u2019d better sty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that will spoil my chances for work,\u201d I urged.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd work is the most important thing for me just now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he was only a private, he referred me to the adjutant, and to\r\n\r\nthe adjutant I repeated my reasons for wishing to go, and politely requested\r\n\r\nthat he let me go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it cawn\u2019t be done,\u201d he said, waxing virtuously\r\n\r\nindignant at such ingratitude. \u201cThe idea!\u201d he snorted.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe idea!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to say that I can\u2019t get out of here?\u201d\r\n\r\nI demanded. \u201cThat you will keep me here against my will?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he snorted.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know what might have happened, for I was waxing indignant\r\n\r\nmyself; but the \u201ccongregation\u201d had \u201cpiped\u201d the\r\n\r\nsituation, and he drew me over to a corner of the room, and then into\r\n\r\nanother room. Here he again demanded my reasons for wishing to\r\n\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to go,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause I wish to look\r\n\r\nfor work over in Stepney, and every hour lessens my chance of finding\r\n\r\nwork. It is now twenty-five minutes to twelve. I did not\r\n\r\nthink when I came in that it would take so long to get a breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou \u2019ave business, eh?\u201d he sneered. \u201cA\r\n\r\nman of business you are, eh? Then wot did you come \u2019ere\r\n\r\nfor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI was out all night, and I needed a breakfast in order to\r\n\r\nstrengthen me to find work. That is why I came here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cA nice thing to do,\u201d he went on in the same sneering\r\n\r\nmanner. \u201cA man with business shouldn\u2019t come \u2019ere.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve tyken some poor man\u2019s breakfast \u2019ere this morning,\r\n\r\nthat\u2019s wot you\u2019ve done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich was a lie, for every mother\u2019s son of us had come in.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I submit, was this Christian-like, or even honest?\u2014after\r\n\r\nI had plainly stated that I was homeless and hungry, and that I wished\r\n\r\nto look for work, for him to call my looking for work \u201cbusiness,\u201d\r\n\r\nto call me therefore a business man, and to draw the corollary that\r\n\r\na man of business, and well off, did not require a charity breakfast,\r\n\r\nand that by taking a charity breakfast I had robbed some hungry waif\r\n\r\nwho was not a man of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nI kept my temper, but I went over the facts again, and clearly and\r\n\r\nconcisely demonstrated to him how unjust he was and how he had perverted\r\n\r\nthe facts. As I manifested no signs of backing down (and I am\r\n\r\nsure my eyes were beginning to snap), he led me to the rear of the building\r\n\r\nwhere, in an open court, stood a tent. In the same sneering tone\r\n\r\nhe informed a couple of privates standing there that \u201c\u2019ere\r\n\r\nis a fellow that \u2019as business an\u2019 \u2019e wants to go before\r\n\r\nservices.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were duly shocked, of course, and they looked unutterable horror\r\n\r\nwhile he went into the tent and brought out the major. Still in\r\n\r\nthe same sneering manner, laying particular stress on the \u201cbusiness,\u201d\r\n\r\nhe brought my case before the commanding officer. The major was\r\n\r\nof a different stamp of man. I liked him as soon as I saw him,\r\n\r\nand to him I stated my case in the same fashion as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know you had to stay for services?\u201d\r\n\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d I answered, \u201cor I should have\r\n\r\ngone without my breakfast. You have no placards posted to that\r\n\r\neffect, nor was I so informed when I entered the place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe meditated a moment. \u201cYou can go,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was twelve o\u2019clock when I gained the street, and I couldn\u2019t\r\n\r\nquite make up my mind whether I had been in the army or in prison.\r\n\r\nThe day was half gone, and it was a far fetch to Stepney. And\r\n\r\nbesides, it was Sunday, and why should even a starving man look for\r\n\r\nwork on Sunday? Furthermore, it was my judgment that I had done\r\n\r\na hard night\u2019s work walking the streets, and a hard day\u2019s\r\n\r\nwork getting my breakfast; so I disconnected myself from my working\r\n\r\nhypothesis of a starving young man in search of employment, hailed a\r\n\r\nbus, and climbed aboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a shave and a bath, with my clothes all off, I got in between\r\n\r\nclean white sheets and went to sleep. It was six in the evening\r\n\r\nwhen I closed my eyes. When they opened again, the clocks were\r\n\r\nstriking nine next morning. I had slept fifteen straight hours.\r\n\r\nAnd as I lay there drowsily, my mind went back to the seven hundred\r\n\r\nunfortunates I had left waiting for services. No bath, no shave\r\n\r\nfor them, no clean white sheets and all clothes off, and fifteen hours\u2019\r\n\r\nstraight sleep. Services over, it was the weary streets again,\r\n\r\nthe problem of a crust of bread ere night, and the long sleepless night\r\n\r\nin the streets, and the pondering of the problem of how to obtain a\r\n\r\ncrust at dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCORONATION DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou that sea-walls sever\r\n\r\nFrom lands unwalled by seas!\r\n\r\nWilt thou endure forever,\r\n\r\nO Milton\u2019s England, these?\r\n\r\nThou that wast his Republic,\r\n\r\nWilt thou clasp their knees?\r\n\r\nThese royalties rust-eaten,\r\n\r\nThese worm-corroded lies\r\n\r\nThat keep thy head storm-beaten,\r\n\r\nAnd sun-like strength of eyes\r\n\r\nFrom the open air and heaven\r\n\r\nOf intercepted skies!\r\n\r\n\r\nSWINBURNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nVivat Rex Eduardus! They crowned a king this day, and there\r\n\r\nhas been great rejoicing and elaborate tomfoolery, and I am perplexed\r\n\r\nand saddened. I never saw anything to compare with the pageant,\r\n\r\nexcept Yankee circuses and Alhambra ballets; nor did I ever see anything\r\n\r\nso hopeless and so tragic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have enjoyed the Coronation procession, I should have come straight\r\n\r\nfrom America to the Hotel Cecil, and straight from the Hotel Cecil to\r\n\r\na five-guinea seat among the washed. My mistake was in coming\r\n\r\nfrom the unwashed of the East End. There were not many who came\r\n\r\nfrom that quarter. The East End, as a whole, remained in the East\r\n\r\nEnd and got drunk. The Socialists, Democrats, and Republicans\r\n\r\nwent off to the country for a breath of fresh air, quite unaffected\r\n\r\nby the fact that four hundred millions of people were taking to themselves\r\n\r\na crowned and anointed ruler. Six thousand five hundred prelates,\r\n\r\npriests, statesmen, princes, and warriors beheld the crowning and anointing,\r\n\r\nand the rest of us the pageant as it passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw it at Trafalgar Square, \u201cthe most splendid site in Europe,\u201d\r\n\r\nand the very innermost heart of the empire. There were many thousands\r\n\r\nof us, all checked and held in order by a superb display of armed power.\r\n\r\nThe line of march was double-walled with soldiers. The base of\r\n\r\nthe Nelson Column was triple-fringed with bluejackets. Eastward,\r\n\r\nat the entrance to the square, stood the Royal Marine Artillery.\r\n\r\nIn the triangle of Pall Mall and Cockspur Street, the statue of George\r\n\r\nIII. was buttressed on either side by the Lancers and Hussars.\r\n\r\nTo the west were the red-coats of the Royal Marines, and from the Union\r\n\r\nClub to the embouchure of Whitehall swept the glittering, massive curve\r\n\r\nof the 1st Life Guards\u2014gigantic men mounted on gigantic chargers,\r\n\r\nsteel-breastplated, steel-helmeted, steel-caparisoned, a great war-sword\r\n\r\nof steel ready to the hand of the powers that be. And further,\r\n\r\nthroughout the crowd, were flung long lines of the Metropolitan Constabulary,\r\n\r\nwhile in the rear were the reserves\u2014tall, well-fed men, with weapons\r\n\r\nto wield and muscles to wield them in ease of need.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as it was thus at Trafalgar Square, so was it along the whole\r\n\r\nline of march\u2014force, overpowering force; myriads of men, splendid\r\n\r\nmen, the pick of the people, whose sole function in life is blindly\r\n\r\nto obey, and blindly to kill and destroy and stamp out life. And\r\n\r\nthat they should be well fed, well clothed, and well armed, and have\r\n\r\nships to hurl them to the ends of the earth, the East End of London,\r\n\r\nand the \u201cEast End\u201d of all England, toils and rots and dies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a Chinese proverb that if one man lives in laziness another will die\r\n\r\nof hunger; and Montesquieu has said, \u201cThe fact that many men are occupied\r\n\r\nin making clothes for one individual is the cause of there being many people\r\n\r\nwithout clothes.\u201d So one explains the other. We cannot understand the\r\n\r\nstarved and runty[2]\r\n\r\ntoiler of the East End (living with his family in a one-room den, and letting\r\n\r\nout the floor space for lodgings to other starved and runty toilers) till we\r\n\r\nlook at the strapping Life Guardsmen of the West End, and come to know that the\r\n\r\none must feed and clothe and groom the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2]\r\n\r\n\u201cRunt\u201d in America is the equivalent of the English\r\n\r\n\u201ccrowl,\u201d the dwarf of a litter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd while in Westminster Abbey the people were taking unto themselves\r\n\r\na king, I, jammed between the Life Guards and Constabulary of Trafalgar\r\n\r\nSquare, was dwelling upon the time when the people of Israel first took\r\n\r\nunto themselves a king. You all know how it runs. The elders\r\n\r\ncame to the prophet Samuel, and said: \u201cMake us a king to judge\r\n\r\nus like all the nations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord said unto Samuel: Now therefore hearken\r\n\r\nunto their voice; howbeit thou shalt show them the manner of the king\r\n\r\nthat shall reign over them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked\r\n\r\nof him a king, and he said:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you; he\r\n\r\nwill take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and\r\n\r\nto be his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and\r\n\r\ncaptains of fifties; and he will set some to plough his ground, and\r\n\r\nto reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments\r\n\r\nof his chariots.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be\r\n\r\ncooks, and to be bakers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he will take your fields and your vineyards, and your oliveyards,\r\n\r\neven the best of them, and give them to his servants.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he will take a tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and\r\n\r\ngive to his officers, and to his servants.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your\r\n\r\ngoodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe will take a tenth of your flocks; and ye shall be his servants.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall call out in that day because of your king which ye shall\r\n\r\nhave chosen you; and the Lord will not answer you in that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of which came to pass in that ancient day, and they did cry out\r\n\r\nto Samuel, saying: \u201cPray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God,\r\n\r\nthat we die not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask\r\n\r\nus a king.\u201d And after Saul, David, and Solomon, came Rehoboam,\r\n\r\nwho \u201canswered the people roughly, saying: My father made your\r\n\r\nyoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with\r\n\r\nwhips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in these latter days, five hundred hereditary peers own one-fifth\r\n\r\nof England; and they, and the officers and servants under the King,\r\n\r\nand those who go to compose the powers that be, yearly spend in wasteful\r\n\r\nluxury $1,850,000,000, or \u00a3370,000,000, which is thirty-two per\r\n\r\ncent. of the total wealth produced by all the toilers of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Abbey, clad in wonderful golden raiment, amid fanfare of trumpets and\r\n\r\nthrobbing of music, surrounded by a brilliant throng of masters, lords, and\r\n\r\nrulers, the King was being invested with the insignia of his sovereignty. The\r\n\r\nspurs were placed to his heels by the Lord Great Chamberlain, and a sword of\r\n\r\nstate, in purple scabbard, was presented him by the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\n\r\nwith these words:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nReceive this kingly sword brought now from the altar of God, and delivered to\r\n\r\nyou by the hands of the bishops and servants of God, though unworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereupon, being girded, he gave heed to the Archbishop\u2019s\r\n\r\nexhortation:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity, protect the Holy\r\n\r\nChurch of God, help and defend widows and orphans, restore the things that are\r\n\r\ngone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform what is\r\n\r\namiss, and confirm what is in good order.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut hark! There is cheering down Whitehall; the crowd sways,\r\n\r\nthe double walls of soldiers come to attention, and into view swing\r\n\r\nthe King\u2019s watermen, in fantastic mediaeval garbs of red, for\r\n\r\nall the world like the van of a circus parade. Then a royal carriage,\r\n\r\nfilled with ladies and gentlemen of the household, with powdered footmen\r\n\r\nand coachmen most gorgeously arrayed. More carriages, lords, and\r\n\r\nchamberlains, viscounts, mistresses of the robes\u2014lackeys all.\r\n\r\nThen the warriors, a kingly escort, generals, bronzed and worn, from\r\n\r\nthe ends of the earth come up to London Town, volunteer officers, officers\r\n\r\nof the militia and regular forces; Spens and Plumer, Broadwood and Cooper\r\n\r\nwho relieved Ookiep, Mathias of Dargai, Dixon of Vlakfontein; General\r\n\r\nGaselee and Admiral Seymour of China; Kitchener of Khartoum; Lord Roberts\r\n\r\nof India and all the world\u2014the fighting men of England, masters\r\n\r\nof destruction, engineers of death! Another race of men from those\r\n\r\nof the shops and slums, a totally different race of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut here they come, in all the pomp and certitude of power, and still\r\n\r\nthey come, these men of steel, these war lords and world harnessers.\r\n\r\nPell-mell, peers and commoners, princes and maharajahs, Equerries to\r\n\r\nthe King and Yeomen of the Guard. And here the colonials, lithe\r\n\r\nand hardy men; and here all the breeds of all the world-soldiers from\r\n\r\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand; from Bermuda, Borneo, Fiji, and the\r\n\r\nGold Coast; from Rhodesia, Cape Colony, Natal, Sierra Leone and Gambia,\r\n\r\nNigeria, and Uganda; from Ceylon, Cyprus, Hong-Kong, Jamaica, and Wei-Hai-Wei;\r\n\r\nfrom Lagos, Malta, St. Lucia, Singapore, Trinidad. And here the\r\n\r\nconquered men of Ind, swarthy horsemen and sword wielders, fiercely\r\n\r\nbarbaric, blazing in crimson and scarlet, Sikhs, Rajputs, Burmese, province\r\n\r\nby province, and caste by caste.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the Horse Guards, a glimpse of beautiful cream ponies, and\r\n\r\na golden panoply, a hurricane of cheers, the crashing of bands\u2014\u201cThe\r\n\r\nKing! the King! God save the King!\u201d Everybody has\r\n\r\ngone mad. The contagion is sweeping me off my feet\u2014I, too,\r\n\r\nwant to shout, \u201cThe King! God save the King!\u201d\r\n\r\nRagged men about me, tears in their eyes, are tossing up their hats\r\n\r\nand crying ecstatically, \u201cBless \u2019em! Bless \u2019em!\r\n\r\nBless \u2019em!\u201d See, there he is, in that wondrous golden\r\n\r\ncoach, the great crown flashing on his head, the woman in white beside\r\n\r\nhim likewise crowned.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I check myself with a rush, striving to convince myself that\r\n\r\nit is all real and rational, and not some glimpse of fairyland.\r\n\r\nThis I cannot succeed in doing, and it is better so. I much prefer\r\n\r\nto believe that all this pomp, and vanity, and show, and mumbo-jumbo\r\n\r\nfoolery has come from fairyland, than to believe it the performance\r\n\r\nof sane and sensible people who have mastered matter and solved the\r\n\r\nsecrets of the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinces and princelings, dukes, duchesses, and all manner of coroneted folk of\r\n\r\nthe royal train are flashing past; more warriors, and lackeys, and conquered\r\n\r\npeoples, and the pageant is over. I drift with the crowd out of the square into\r\n\r\na tangle of narrow streets, where the public-houses are a-roar with\r\n\r\ndrunkenness, men, women, and children mixed together in colossal debauch. And\r\n\r\non every side is rising the favourite song of the Coronation:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! on Coronation Day, on Coronation Day,\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll have a spree, a jubilee, and shout, Hip, hip, hooray,\r\n\r\nFor we\u2019ll all be merry, drinking whisky, wine, and sherry,\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll all be merry on Coronation Day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain is pouring down. Up the street come troops of the\r\n\r\nauxiliaries, black Africans and yellow Asiatics, beturbaned and befezed,\r\n\r\nand coolies swinging along with machine guns and mountain batteries\r\n\r\non their heads, and the bare feet of all, in quick rhythm, going slish,\r\n\r\nslish, slish through the pavement mud. The public-houses empty\r\n\r\nby magic, and the swarthy allegiants are cheered by their British brothers,\r\n\r\nwho return at once to the carouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you like the procession, mate?\u201d I asked\r\n\r\nan old man on a bench in Green Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Ow did I like it? A bloomin\u2019 good chawnce,\r\n\r\nsez I to myself, for a sleep, wi\u2019 all the coppers aw\u2019y,\r\n\r\nso I turned into the corner there, along wi\u2019 fifty others.\r\n\r\nBut I couldn\u2019t sleep, a-lyin\u2019 there an\u2019 thinkin\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2019ow I\u2019d worked all the years o\u2019 my life an\u2019\r\n\r\nnow \u2019ad no plyce to rest my \u2019ead; an\u2019 the music comin\u2019\r\n\r\nto me, an\u2019 the cheers an\u2019 cannon, till I got almost a hanarchist\r\n\r\nan\u2019 wanted to blow out the brains o\u2019 the Lord Chamberlain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy the Lord Chamberlain I could not precisely see, nor could he, but that was\r\n\r\nthe way he felt, he said conclusively, and there was no more discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs night drew on, the city became a blaze of light. Splashes\r\n\r\nof colour, green, amber, and ruby, caught the eye at every point, and\r\n\r\n\u201cE. R.,\u201d in great crystal letters and backed by flaming\r\n\r\ngas, was everywhere. The crowds in the streets increased by hundreds\r\n\r\nof thousands, and though the police sternly put down mafficking, drunkenness\r\n\r\nand rough play abounded. The tired workers seemed to have gone\r\n\r\nmad with the relaxation and excitement, and they surged and danced down\r\n\r\nthe streets, men and women, old and young, with linked arms and in long\r\n\r\nrows, singing, \u201cI may be crazy, but I love you,\u201d \u201cDolly\r\n\r\nGray,\u201d and \u201cThe Honeysuckle and the Bee\u201d\u2014the\r\n\r\nlast rendered something like this:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYew aw the enny, ennyseckle, Oi em ther bee,\r\n\r\nOi\u2019d like ter sip ther enny from those red lips, yew see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI sat on a bench on the Thames Embankment, looking across the illuminated\r\n\r\nwater. It was approaching midnight, and before me poured the better\r\n\r\nclass of merrymakers, shunning the more riotous streets and returning\r\n\r\nhome. On the bench beside me sat two ragged creatures, a man and\r\n\r\na woman, nodding and dozing. The woman sat with her arms clasped\r\n\r\nacross the breast, holding tightly, her body in constant play\u2014now\r\n\r\ndropping forward till it seemed its balance would be overcome and she\r\n\r\nwould fall to the pavement; now inclining to the left, sideways, till\r\n\r\nher head rested on the man\u2019s shoulder; and now to the right, stretched\r\n\r\nand strained, till the pain of it awoke her and she sat bolt upright.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the dropping forward would begin again and go through its\r\n\r\ncycle till she was aroused by the strain and stretch.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery little while boys and young men stopped long enough to go behind\r\n\r\nthe bench and give vent to sudden and fiendish shouts. This always\r\n\r\njerked the man and woman abruptly from their sleep; and at sight of\r\n\r\nthe startled woe upon their faces the crowd would roar with laughter\r\n\r\nas it flooded past.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the most striking thing, the general heartlessness exhibited\r\n\r\non every hand. It is a commonplace, the homeless on the benches,\r\n\r\nthe poor miserable folk who may be teased and are harmless. Fifty\r\n\r\nthousand people must have passed the bench while I sat upon it, and\r\n\r\nnot one, on such a jubilee occasion as the crowning of the King, felt\r\n\r\nhis heart-strings touched sufficiently to come up and say to the woman:\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s sixpence; go and get a bed.\u201d But the\r\n\r\nwomen, especially the young women, made witty remarks upon the woman\r\n\r\nnodding, and invariably set their companions laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use a Briticism, it was \u201ccruel\u201d; the corresponding\r\n\r\nAmericanism was more appropriate\u2014it was \u201cfierce.\u201d\r\n\r\nI confess I began to grow incensed at this happy crowd streaming by,\r\n\r\nand to extract a sort of satisfaction from the London statistics which\r\n\r\ndemonstrate that one in every four adults is destined to die on public\r\n\r\ncharity, either in the workhouse, the infirmary, or the asylum.\r\n\r\n\r\nI talked with the man. He was fifty-four and a broken-down\r\n\r\ndocker. He could only find odd work when there was a large demand\r\n\r\nfor labour, for the younger and stronger men were preferred when times\r\n\r\nwere slack. He had spent a week, now, on the benches of the Embankment;\r\n\r\nbut things looked brighter for next week, and he might possibly get\r\n\r\nin a few days\u2019 work and have a bed in some doss-house. He\r\n\r\nhad lived all his life in London, save for five years, when, in 1878,\r\n\r\nhe saw foreign service in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course he would eat; so would the girl. Days like this were\r\n\r\nuncommon hard on such as they, though the coppers were so busy poor\r\n\r\nfolk could get in more sleep. I awoke the girl, or woman, rather,\r\n\r\nfor she was \u201cEyght an\u2019 twenty, sir,\u201d and we started\r\n\r\nfor a coffee-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWot a lot o\u2019 work puttin\u2019 up the lights,\u201d\r\n\r\nsaid the man at sight of some building superbly illuminated. This\r\n\r\nwas the keynote of his being. All his life he had worked, and\r\n\r\nthe whole objective universe, as well as his own soul, he could express\r\n\r\nin terms only of work. \u201cCoronations is some good,\u201d\r\n\r\nhe went on. \u201cThey give work to men.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut your belly is empty,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cI tried, but there wasn\u2019t\r\n\r\nany chawnce. My age is against me. Wot do you work at?\r\n\r\nSeafarin\u2019 chap, eh? I knew it from yer clothes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI know wot you are,\u201d said the girl, \u201can Eyetalian.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo \u2019e ayn\u2019t,\u201d the man cried heatedly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019E\u2019s a Yank, that\u2019s wot \u2019e is.\r\n\r\nI know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cLord lumme, look a\u2019 that,\u201d she exclaimed, as we debouched\r\n\r\nupon the Strand, choked with the roaring, reeling Coronation crowd, the men\r\n\r\nbellowing and the girls singing in high throaty notes:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! on Coronation D\u2019y, on Coronation D\u2019y,\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll \u2019ave a spree, a jubilee, an\u2019 shout \u2019Ip,\r\n\r\n\u2019ip, \u2019ooray;\r\n\r\nFor we\u2019ll all be merry, drinkin\u2019 whisky, wine, and sherry,\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll all be merry on Coronation D\u2019y.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Ow dirty I am, bein\u2019 around the w\u2019y I \u2019ave,\u201d\r\n\r\nthe woman said, as she sat down in a coffee-house, wiping the sleep\r\n\r\nand grime from the corners of her eyes. \u201cAn\u2019 the sights\r\n\r\nI \u2019ave seen this d\u2019y, an\u2019 I enjoyed it, though it\r\n\r\nwas lonesome by myself. An\u2019 the duchesses an\u2019 the\r\n\r\nlydies \u2019ad sich gran\u2019 w\u2019ite dresses. They was\r\n\r\njest bu\u2019ful, bu\u2019ful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Irish,\u201d she said, in answer to a question.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy nyme\u2019s Eyethorne.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cEyethorne, sir; Eyethorne.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cSpell it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cH-a-y-t-h-o-r-n-e, Eyethorne.\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, \u201cIrish Cockney.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, London-born.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had lived happily at home till her father died, killed in an\r\n\r\naccident, when she had found herself on the world. One brother\r\n\r\nwas in the army, and the other brother, engaged in keeping a wife and\r\n\r\neight children on twenty shillings a week and unsteady employment, could\r\n\r\ndo nothing for her. She had been out of London once in her life,\r\n\r\nto a place in Essex, twelve miles away, where she had picked fruit for\r\n\r\nthree weeks: \u201cAn\u2019 I was as brown as a berry w\u2019en I\r\n\r\ncome back. You won\u2019t b\u2019lieve it, but I was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last place in which she had worked was a coffee-house, hours\r\n\r\nfrom seven in the morning till eleven at night, and for which she had\r\n\r\nreceived five shillings a week and her food. Then she had fallen\r\n\r\nsick, and since emerging from the hospital had been unable to find anything\r\n\r\nto do. She wasn\u2019t feeling up to much, and the last two nights\r\n\r\nhad been spent in the street.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween them they stowed away a prodigious amount of food, this man\r\n\r\nand woman, and it was not till I had duplicated and triplicated their\r\n\r\noriginal orders that they showed signs of easing down.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce she reached across and felt the texture of my coat and shirt,\r\n\r\nand remarked upon the good clothes the Yanks wore. My rags good\r\n\r\nclothes! It put me to the blush; but, on inspecting them more\r\n\r\nclosely and on examining the clothes worn by the man and woman, I began\r\n\r\nto feel quite well dressed and respectable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you expect to do in the end?\u201d I asked them.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re growing older every day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWork\u2019ouse,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cGawd blimey if I do,\u201d said she. \u201cThere\u2019s\r\n\r\nno \u2019ope for me, I know, but I\u2019ll die on the streets.\r\n\r\nNo work\u2019ouse for me, thank you. No, indeed,\u201d she sniffed\r\n\r\nin the silence that fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter you have been out all night in the streets,\u201d I\r\n\r\nasked, \u201cwhat do you do in the morning for something to eat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTry to get a penny, if you \u2019aven\u2019t one saved over,\u201d\r\n\r\nthe man explained. \u201cThen go to a coffee-\u2019ouse an\u2019\r\n\r\nget a mug o\u2019 tea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t see how that is to feed you,\u201d I objected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pair smiled knowingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou drink your tea in little sips,\u201d he went on, \u201cmaking\r\n\r\nit last its longest. An\u2019 you look sharp, an\u2019 there\u2019s\r\n\r\nsome as leaves a bit be\u2019ind \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s s\u2019prisin\u2019, the food wot some people\r\n\r\nleaves,\u201d the woman broke in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe thing,\u201d said the man judicially, as the trick dawned\r\n\r\nupon me, \u201cis to get \u2019old o\u2019 the penny.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we started to leave, Miss Haythorne gathered up a couple of crusts\r\n\r\nfrom the neighbouring tables and thrust them somewhere into her rags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCawn\u2019t wyste \u2019em, you know,\u201d said she; to\r\n\r\nwhich the docker nodded, tucking away a couple of crusts himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt three in the morning I strolled up the Embankment. It was\r\n\r\na gala night for the homeless, for the police were elsewhere; and each\r\n\r\nbench was jammed with sleeping occupants. There were as many women\r\n\r\nas men, and the great majority of them, male and female, were old.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a boy was to be seen. On one bench I noticed a family,\r\n\r\na man sitting upright with a sleeping babe in his arms, his wife asleep,\r\n\r\nher head on his shoulder, and in her lap the head of a sleeping youngster.\r\n\r\nThe man\u2019s eyes were wide open. He was staring out over the\r\n\r\nwater and thinking, which is not a good thing for a shelterless man\r\n\r\nwith a family to do. It would not be a pleasant thing to speculate\r\n\r\nupon his thoughts; but this I know, and all London knows, that the cases\r\n\r\nof out-of-works killing their wives and babies is not an uncommon happening.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne cannot walk along the Thames Embankment, in the small hours of\r\n\r\nmorning, from the Houses of Parliament, past Cleopatra\u2019s Needle,\r\n\r\nto Waterloo Bridge, without being reminded of the sufferings, seven\r\n\r\nand twenty centuries old, recited by the author of \u201cJob\u201d:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are that remove the landmarks; they violently take\r\n\r\naway flocks and feed them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow\u2019s\r\n\r\nox for a pledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey turn the needy out of the way; the poor of the earth hide themselves\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehold, as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their work,\r\n\r\nseeking diligently for meat; the wilderness yieldeth them food for their\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey cut their provender in the field, and they glean the vintage\r\n\r\nof the wicked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in\r\n\r\nthe cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock\r\n\r\nfor want of a shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge\r\n\r\nof the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that they go about naked without clothing, and being an hungered\r\n\r\nthey carry the sheaves.\u2014Job xxiv. 2-10.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven and twenty centuries agone! And it is all as true and\r\n\r\napposite to-day in the innermost centre of this Christian civilisation\r\n\r\nwhereof Edward VII. is king.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nDAN CULLEN, DOCKER\r\n\r\n\r\nI stood, yesterday, in a room in one of the \u201cMunicipal Dwellings,\u201d\r\n\r\nnot far from Leman Street. If I looked into a dreary future and\r\n\r\nsaw that I would have to live in such a room until I died, I should\r\n\r\nimmediately go down, plump into the Thames, and cut the tenancy short.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not a room. Courtesy to the language will no more permit\r\n\r\nit to be called a room than it will permit a hovel to be called a mansion.\r\n\r\nIt was a den, a lair. Seven feet by eight were its dimensions,\r\n\r\nand the ceiling was so low as not to give the cubic air space required\r\n\r\nby a British soldier in barracks. A crazy couch, with ragged coverlets,\r\n\r\noccupied nearly half the room. A rickety table, a chair, and a\r\n\r\ncouple of boxes left little space in which to turn around. Five\r\n\r\ndollars would have purchased everything in sight. The floor was\r\n\r\nbare, while the walls and ceiling were literally covered with blood\r\n\r\nmarks and splotches. Each mark represented a violent death\u2014of\r\n\r\nan insect, for the place swarmed with vermin, a plague with which no\r\n\r\nperson could cope single-handed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who had occupied this hole, one Dan Cullen, docker, was dying\r\n\r\nin hospital. Yet he had impressed his personality on his miserable\r\n\r\nsurroundings sufficiently to give an inkling as to what sort of man\r\n\r\nhe was. On the walls were cheap pictures of Garibaldi, Engels,\r\n\r\nDan Burns, and other labour leaders, while on the table lay one of Walter\r\n\r\nBesant\u2019s novels. He knew his Shakespeare, I was told, and\r\n\r\nhad read history, sociology, and economics. And he was self-educated.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the table, amidst a wonderful disarray, lay a sheet of paper on\r\n\r\nwhich was scrawled: Mr. Cullen, please return the large white jug\r\n\r\nand corkscrew I lent you\u2014articles loaned, during the first\r\n\r\nstages of his sickness, by a woman neighbour, and demanded back in anticipation\r\n\r\nof his death. A large white jug and a corkscrew are far too valuable\r\n\r\nto a creature of the Abyss to permit another creature to die in peace.\r\n\r\nTo the last, Dan Cullen\u2019s soul must be harrowed by the sordidness\r\n\r\nout of which it strove vainly to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a brief little story, the story of Dan Cullen, but there is\r\n\r\nmuch to read between the lines. He was born lowly, in a city and\r\n\r\nland where the lines of caste are tightly drawn. All his days\r\n\r\nhe toiled hard with his body; and because he had opened the books, and\r\n\r\nbeen caught up by the fires of the spirit, and could \u201cwrite a\r\n\r\nletter like a lawyer,\u201d he had been selected by his fellows to\r\n\r\ntoil hard for them with his brain. He became a leader of the fruit-porters,\r\n\r\nrepresented the dockers on the London Trades Council, and wrote trenchant\r\n\r\narticles for the labour journals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did not cringe to other men, even though they were his economic\r\n\r\nmasters, and controlled the means whereby he lived, and he spoke his\r\n\r\nmind freely, and fought the good fight. In the \u201cGreat Dock\r\n\r\nStrike\u201d he was guilty of taking a leading part. And that\r\n\r\nwas the end of Dan Cullen. From that day he was a marked man,\r\n\r\nand every day, for ten years and more, he was \u201cpaid off\u201d\r\n\r\nfor what he had done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA docker is a casual labourer. Work ebbs and flows, and he\r\n\r\nworks or does not work according to the amount of goods on hand to be\r\n\r\nmoved. Dan Cullen was discriminated against. While he was\r\n\r\nnot absolutely turned away (which would have caused trouble, and which\r\n\r\nwould certainly have been more merciful), he was called in by the foreman\r\n\r\nto do not more than two or three days\u2019 work per week. This\r\n\r\nis what is called being \u201cdisciplined,\u201d or \u201cdrilled.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt means being starved. There is no politer word. Ten years\r\n\r\nof it broke his heart, and broken-hearted men cannot live.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe took to his bed in his terrible den, which grew more terrible\r\n\r\nwith his helplessness. He was without kith or kin, a lonely old\r\n\r\nman, embittered and pessimistic, fighting vermin the while and looking\r\n\r\nat Garibaldi, Engels, and Dan Burns gazing down at him from the blood-bespattered\r\n\r\nwalls. No one came to see him in that crowded municipal barracks\r\n\r\n(he had made friends with none of them), and he was left to rot.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut from the far reaches of the East End came a cobbler and his son,\r\n\r\nhis sole friends. They cleansed his room, brought fresh linen\r\n\r\nfrom home, and took from off his limbs the sheets, greyish-black with\r\n\r\ndirt. And they brought to him one of the Queen\u2019s Bounty\r\n\r\nnurses from Aldgate.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe washed his face, shook up his couch, and talked with him. It was\r\n\r\ninteresting to talk with him\u2014until he learned her name. Oh, yes, Blank\r\n\r\nwas her name, she replied innocently, and Sir George Blank was her brother. Sir\r\n\r\nGeorge Blank, eh? thundered old Dan Cullen on his death-bed; Sir George Blank,\r\n\r\nsolicitor to the docks at Cardiff, who, more than any other man, had broken up\r\n\r\nthe Dockers\u2019 Union of Cardiff, and was knighted? And she was his sister?\r\n\r\nThereupon Dan Cullen sat up on his crazy couch and pronounced anathema upon her\r\n\r\nand all her breed; and she fled, to return no more, strongly impressed with the\r\n\r\nungratefulness of the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDan Cullen\u2019s feet became swollen with dropsy. He sat\r\n\r\nup all day on the side of the bed (to keep the water out of his body),\r\n\r\nno mat on the floor, a thin blanket on his legs, and an old coat around\r\n\r\nhis shoulders. A missionary brought him a pair of paper slippers,\r\n\r\nworth fourpence (I saw them), and proceeded to offer up fifty prayers\r\n\r\nor so for the good of Dan Cullen\u2019s soul. But Dan Cullen\r\n\r\nwas the sort of man that wanted his soul left alone. He did not\r\n\r\ncare to have Tom, Dick, or Harry, on the strength of fourpenny slippers,\r\n\r\ntampering with it. He asked the missionary kindly to open the\r\n\r\nwindow, so that he might toss the slippers out. And the missionary\r\n\r\nwent away, to return no more, likewise impressed with the ungratefulness\r\n\r\nof the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cobbler, a brave old hero himself, though unannaled and unsung, went\r\n\r\nprivily to the head office of the big fruit brokers for whom Dan Cullen had\r\n\r\nworked as a casual labourer for thirty years. Their system was such that the\r\n\r\nwork was almost entirely done by casual hands. The cobbler told them the\r\n\r\nman\u2019s desperate plight, old, broken, dying, without help or money,\r\n\r\nreminded them that he had worked for them thirty years, and asked them to do\r\n\r\nsomething for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the manager, remembering Dan Cullen without\r\n\r\nhaving to refer to the books, \u201cyou see, we make it a rule never\r\n\r\nto help casuals, and we can do nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nNor did they do anything, not even sign a letter asking for Dan Cullen\u2019s\r\n\r\nadmission to a hospital. And it is not so easy to get into a hospital\r\n\r\nin London Town. At Hampstead, if he passed the doctors, at least\r\n\r\nfour months would elapse before he could get in, there were so many\r\n\r\non the books ahead of him. The cobbler finally got him into the\r\n\r\nWhitechapel Infirmary, where he visited him frequently. Here he\r\n\r\nfound that Dan Cullen had succumbed to the prevalent feeling, that,\r\n\r\nbeing hopeless, they were hurrying him out of the way. A fair\r\n\r\nand logical conclusion, one must agree, for an old and broken man to\r\n\r\narrive at, who has been resolutely \u201cdisciplined\u201d and \u201cdrilled\u201d\r\n\r\nfor ten years. When they sweated him for Bright\u2019s disease\r\n\r\nto remove the fat from the kidneys, Dan Cullen contended that the sweating\r\n\r\nwas hastening his death; while Bright\u2019s disease, being a wasting\r\n\r\naway of the kidneys, there was therefore no fat to remove, and the doctor\u2019s\r\n\r\nexcuse was a palpable lie. Whereupon the doctor became wroth,\r\n\r\nand did not come near him for nine days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen his bed was tilted up so that his feet and legs were elevated.\r\n\r\nAt once dropsy appeared in the body, and Dan Cullen contended that the\r\n\r\nthing was done in order to run the water down into his body from his\r\n\r\nlegs and kill him more quickly. He demanded his discharge, though\r\n\r\nthey told him he would die on the stairs, and dragged himself, more\r\n\r\ndead than alive, to the cobbler\u2019s shop. At the moment of\r\n\r\nwriting this, he is dying at the Temperance Hospital, into which place\r\n\r\nhis staunch friend, the cobbler, moved heaven and earth to have him\r\n\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Dan Cullen! A Jude the Obscure, who reached out after\r\n\r\nknowledge; who toiled with his body in the day and studied in the watches\r\n\r\nof the night; who dreamed his dream and struck valiantly for the Cause;\r\n\r\na patriot, a lover of human freedom, and a fighter unafraid; and in\r\n\r\nthe end, not gigantic enough to beat down the conditions which baffled\r\n\r\nand stifled him, a cynic and a pessimist, gasping his final agony on\r\n\r\na pauper\u2019s couch in a charity ward,\u2014\u201cFor a man to\r\n\r\ndie who might have been wise and was not, this I call a tragedy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHOPS AND HOPPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far has the divorcement of the worker from the soil proceeded,\r\n\r\nthat the farming districts, the civilised world over, are dependent\r\n\r\nupon the cities for the gathering of the harvests. Then it is,\r\n\r\nwhen the land is spilling its ripe wealth to waste, that the street\r\n\r\nfolk, who have been driven away from the soil, are called back to it\r\n\r\nagain. But in England they return, not as prodigals, but as outcasts\r\n\r\nstill, as vagrants and pariahs, to be doubted and flouted by their country\r\n\r\nbrethren, to sleep in jails and casual wards, or under the hedges, and\r\n\r\nto live the Lord knows how.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that Kent alone requires eighty thousand of the street\r\n\r\npeople to pick her hops. And out they come, obedient to the call,\r\n\r\nwhich is the call of their bellies and of the lingering dregs of adventure-lust\r\n\r\nstill in them. Slum, stews, and ghetto pour them forth, and the\r\n\r\nfestering contents of slum, stews, and ghetto are undiminished.\r\n\r\nYet they overrun the country like an army of ghouls, and the country\r\n\r\ndoes not want them. They are out of place. As they drag\r\n\r\ntheir squat, misshapen bodies along the highways and byways, they resemble\r\n\r\nsome vile spawn from underground. Their very presence, the fact\r\n\r\nof their existence, is an outrage to the fresh, bright sun and the green\r\n\r\nand growing things. The clean, upstanding trees cry shame upon\r\n\r\nthem and their withered crookedness, and their rottenness is a slimy\r\n\r\ndesecration of the sweetness and purity of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the picture overdrawn? It all depends. For one who\r\n\r\nsees and thinks life in terms of shares and coupons, it is certainly\r\n\r\noverdrawn. But for one who sees and thinks life in terms of manhood\r\n\r\nand womanhood, it cannot be overdrawn. Such hordes of beastly\r\n\r\nwretchedness and inarticulate misery are no compensation for a millionaire\r\n\r\nbrewer who lives in a West End palace, sates himself with the sensuous\r\n\r\ndelights of London\u2019s golden theatres, hobnobs with lordlings and\r\n\r\nprincelings, and is knighted by the king. Wins his spurs\u2014God\r\n\r\nforbid! In old time the great blonde beasts rode in the battle\u2019s\r\n\r\nvan and won their spurs by cleaving men from pate to chine. And,\r\n\r\nafter all, it is finer to kill a strong man with a clean-slicing blow\r\n\r\nof singing steel than to make a beast of him, and of his seed through\r\n\r\nthe generations, by the artful and spidery manipulation of industry\r\n\r\nand politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to return to the hops. Here the divorcement from the soil\r\n\r\nis as apparent as in every other agricultural line in England.\r\n\r\nWhile the manufacture of beer steadily increases, the growth of hops\r\n\r\nsteadily decreases. In 1835 the acreage under hops was 71,327.\r\n\r\nTo-day it stands at 48,024, a decrease of 3103 from the acreage of last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall as the acreage is this year, a poor summer and terrible storms reduced\r\n\r\nthe yield. This misfortune is divided between the people who own hops and the\r\n\r\npeople who pick hops. The owners perforce must put up with less of the nicer\r\n\r\nthings of life, the pickers with less grub, of which, in the best of times,\r\n\r\nthey never get enough. For weary weeks headlines like the following have\r\n\r\nappeared in the London papers.\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAMPS PLENTIFUL, BUT THE HOPS ARE FEW AND NOT YET READY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there have been numberless paragraphs like this:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the neighbourhood of the hop fields comes news of a distressing nature.\r\n\r\nThe bright outburst of the last two days has sent many hundreds of hoppers into\r\n\r\nKent, who will have to wait till the fields are ready for them. At Dover the\r\n\r\nnumber of vagrants in the workhouse is treble the number there last year at\r\n\r\nthis time, and in other towns the lateness of the season is responsible for a\r\n\r\nlarge increase in the number of casuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo cap their wretchedness, when at last the picking had begun, hops\r\n\r\nand hoppers were well-nigh swept away by a frightful storm of wind,\r\n\r\nrain, and hail. The hops were stripped clean from the poles and\r\n\r\npounded into the earth, while the hoppers, seeking shelter from the\r\n\r\nstinging hail, were close to drowning in their huts and camps on the\r\n\r\nlow-lying ground. Their condition after the storm was pitiable,\r\n\r\ntheir state of vagrancy more pronounced than ever; for, poor crop that\r\n\r\nit was, its destruction had taken away the chance of earning a few pennies,\r\n\r\nand nothing remained for thousands of them but to \u201cpad the hoof\u201d\r\n\r\nback to London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWe ayn\u2019t crossin\u2019-sweepers,\u201d they said,\r\n\r\nturning away from the ground, carpeted ankle-deep with hops.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose that remained grumbled savagely among the half-stripped poles\r\n\r\nat the seven bushels for a shilling\u2014a rate paid in good seasons\r\n\r\nwhen the hops are in prime condition, and a rate likewise paid in bad\r\n\r\nseasons by the growers because they cannot afford more.\r\n\r\n\r\nI passed through Teston and East and West Farleigh shortly after\r\n\r\nthe storm, and listened to the grumbling of the hoppers and saw the\r\n\r\nhops rotting on the ground. At the hothouses of Barham Court,\r\n\r\nthirty thousand panes of glass had been broken by the hail, while peaches,\r\n\r\nplums, pears, apples, rhubarb, cabbages, mangolds, everything, had been\r\n\r\npounded to pieces and torn to shreds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of which was too bad for the owners, certainly; but at the worst,\r\n\r\nnot one of them, for one meal, would have to go short of food or drink.\r\n\r\nYet it was to them that the newspapers devoted columns of sympathy,\r\n\r\ntheir pecuniary losses being detailed at harrowing length. \u201cMr.\r\n\r\nHerbert L--- calculates his loss at \u00a38000;\u201d \u201cMr. F---,\r\n\r\nof brewery fame, who rents all the land in this parish, loses \u00a310,000;\u201d\r\n\r\nand \u201cMr. L---, the Wateringbury brewer, brother to Mr. Herbert\r\n\r\nL---, is another heavy loser.\u201d As for the hoppers, they\r\n\r\ndid not count. Yet I venture to assert that the several almost-square\r\n\r\nmeals lost by underfed William Buggles, and underfed Mrs. Buggles, and\r\n\r\nthe underfed Buggles kiddies, was a greater tragedy than the \u00a310,000\r\n\r\nlost by Mr. F---. And in addition, underfed William Buggles\u2019\r\n\r\ntragedy might be multiplied by thousands where Mr. F---\u2019s could\r\n\r\nnot be multiplied by five.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see how William Buggles and his kind fared, I donned my seafaring\r\n\r\ntogs and started out to get a job. With me was a young East London\r\n\r\ncobbler, Bert, who had yielded to the lure of adventure and joined me\r\n\r\nfor the trip. Acting on my advice, he had brought his \u201cworst\r\n\r\nrags,\u201d and as we hiked up the London road out of Maidstone he\r\n\r\nwas worrying greatly for fear we had come too ill-dressed for the business.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor was he to be blamed. When we stopped in a tavern the publican\r\n\r\neyed us gingerly, nor did his demeanour brighten till we showed him\r\n\r\nthe colour of our cash. The natives along the coast were all dubious;\r\n\r\nand \u201cbean-feasters\u201d from London, dashing past in coaches,\r\n\r\ncheered and jeered and shouted insulting things after us. But\r\n\r\nbefore we were done with the Maidstone district my friend found that\r\n\r\nwe were as well clad, if not better, than the average hopper.\r\n\r\nSome of the bunches of rags we chanced upon were marvellous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tide is out,\u201d called a gypsy-looking woman to her\r\n\r\nmates, as we came up a long row of bins into which the pickers were\r\n\r\nstripping the hops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you twig?\u201d Bert whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s\r\n\r\non to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI twigged. And it must be confessed the figure was an apt one.\r\n\r\nWhen the tide is out boats are left on the beach and do not sail, and\r\n\r\na sailor, when the tide is out, does not sail either. My seafaring\r\n\r\ntogs and my presence in the hop field proclaimed that I was a seaman\r\n\r\nwithout a ship, a man on the beach, and very like a craft at low water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCan yer give us a job, governor?\u201d Bert asked the bailiff,\r\n\r\na kindly faced and elderly man who was very busy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis \u201cNo\u201d was decisively uttered; but Bert clung on and\r\n\r\nfollowed him about, and I followed after, pretty well all over the field.\r\n\r\nWhether our persistency struck the bailiff as anxiety to work, or whether\r\n\r\nhe was affected by our hard-luck appearance and tale, neither Bert nor\r\n\r\nI succeeded in making out; but in the end he softened his heart and\r\n\r\nfound us the one unoccupied bin in the place\u2014a bin deserted by\r\n\r\ntwo other men, from what I could learn, because of inability to make\r\n\r\nliving wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo bad conduct, mind ye,\u201d warned the bailiff, as he\r\n\r\nleft us at work in the midst of the women.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday afternoon, and we knew quitting time would come early;\r\n\r\nso we applied ourselves earnestly to the task, desiring to learn if\r\n\r\nwe could at least make our salt. It was simple work, woman\u2019s\r\n\r\nwork, in fact, and not man\u2019s. We sat on the edge of the\r\n\r\nbin, between the standing hops, while a pole-puller supplied us with\r\n\r\ngreat fragrant branches. In an hour\u2019s time we became as\r\n\r\nexpert as it is possible to become. As soon as the fingers became\r\n\r\naccustomed automatically to differentiate between hops and leaves and\r\n\r\nto strip half-a-dozen blossoms at a time there was no more to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe worked nimbly, and as fast as the women themselves, though their\r\n\r\nbins filled more rapidly because of their swarming children, each of\r\n\r\nwhich picked with two hands almost as fast as we picked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019tcher pick too clean, it\u2019s against the rules,\u201d\r\n\r\none of the women informed us; and we took the tip and were grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the afternoon wore along, we realised that living wages could\r\n\r\nnot be made\u2014by men. Women could pick as much as men, and\r\n\r\nchildren could do almost as well as women; so it was impossible for\r\n\r\na man to compete with a woman and half-a-dozen children. For it\r\n\r\nis the woman and the half-dozen children who count as a unit, and by\r\n\r\ntheir combined capacity determine the unit\u2019s pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, matey, I\u2019m beastly hungry,\u201d said I to Bert.\r\n\r\nWe had not had any dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBlimey, but I could eat the \u2019ops,\u201d he replied.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereupon we both lamented our negligence in not rearing up a numerous\r\n\r\nprogeny to help us in this day of need. And in such fashion we\r\n\r\nwhiled away the time and talked for the edification of our neighbours.\r\n\r\nWe quite won the sympathy of the pole-puller, a young country yokel,\r\n\r\nwho now and again emptied a few picked blossoms into our bin, it being\r\n\r\npart of his business to gather up the stray clusters torn off in the\r\n\r\nprocess of pulling.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith him we discussed how much we could \u201csub,\u201d and were\r\n\r\ninformed that while we were being paid a shilling for seven bushels,\r\n\r\nwe could only \u201csub,\u201d or have advanced to us, a shilling\r\n\r\nfor every twelve bushels. Which is to say that the pay for five\r\n\r\nout of every twelve bushels was withheld\u2014a method of the grower\r\n\r\nto hold the hopper to his work whether the crop runs good or bad, and\r\n\r\nespecially if it runs bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all, it was pleasant sitting there in the bright sunshine,\r\n\r\nthe golden pollen showering from our hands, the pungent aromatic odour\r\n\r\nof the hops biting our nostrils, and the while remembering dimly the\r\n\r\nsounding cities whence these people came. Poor street people!\r\n\r\nPoor gutter folk! Even they grow earth-hungry, and yearn vaguely\r\n\r\nfor the soil from which they have been driven, and for the free life\r\n\r\nin the open, and the wind and rain and sun all undefiled by city smirches.\r\n\r\nAs the sea calls to the sailor, so calls the land to them; and, deep\r\n\r\ndown in their aborted and decaying carcasses, they are stirred strangely\r\n\r\nby the peasant memories of their forbears who lived before cities were.\r\n\r\nAnd in incomprehensible ways they are made glad by the earth smells\r\n\r\nand sights and sounds which their blood has not forgotten though unremembered\r\n\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more \u2019ops, matey,\u201d Bert complained.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was five o\u2019clock, and the pole-pullers had knocked off,\r\n\r\nso that everything could be cleaned up, there being no work on Sunday.\r\n\r\nFor an hour we were forced idly to wait the coming of the measurers,\r\n\r\nour feet tingling with the frost which came on the heels of the setting\r\n\r\nsun. In the adjoining bin, two women and half-a-dozen children\r\n\r\nhad picked nine bushels: so that the five bushels the measurers found\r\n\r\nin our bin demonstrated that we had done equally well, for the half-dozen\r\n\r\nchildren had ranged from nine to fourteen years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive bushels! We worked it out to eight-pence ha\u2019penny,\r\n\r\nor seventeen cents, for two men working three hours and a half.\r\n\r\nFourpence farthing apiece! a little over a penny an hour! But\r\n\r\nwe were allowed only to \u201csub\u201d fivepence of the total sum,\r\n\r\nthough the tally-keeper, short of change, gave us sixpence. Entreaty\r\n\r\nwas in vain. A hard-luck story could not move him. He proclaimed\r\n\r\nloudly that we had received a penny more than our due, and went his\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nGranting, for the sake of the argument, that we were what we represented\r\n\r\nourselves to be\u2014namely, poor men and broke\u2014then here was our\r\n\r\nposition: night was coming on; we had had no supper, much less dinner; and we\r\n\r\npossessed sixpence between us. I was hungry enough to eat three\r\n\r\nsixpenn\u2019orths of food, and so was Bert. One thing was patent. By doing\r\n\r\n16.3 per cent. justice to our stomachs, we would expend the sixpence, and our\r\n\r\nstomachs would still be gnawing under 83.3 per cent. injustice. Being broke\r\n\r\nagain, we could sleep under a hedge, which was not so bad, though the cold\r\n\r\nwould sap an undue portion of what we had eaten. But the morrow was Sunday, on\r\n\r\nwhich we could do no work, though our silly stomachs would not knock off on\r\n\r\nthat account. Here, then, was the problem: how to get three meals on Sunday,\r\n\r\nand two on Monday (for we could not make another \u201csub\u201d till Monday\r\n\r\nevening).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe knew that the casual wards were overcrowded; also, that if we\r\n\r\nbegged from farmer or villager, there was a large likelihood of our\r\n\r\ngoing to jail for fourteen days. What was to be done? We\r\n\r\nlooked at each other in despair\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014Not a bit of it. We joyfully thanked God that we were\r\n\r\nnot as other men, especially hoppers, and went down the road to Maidstone,\r\n\r\njingling in our pockets the half-crowns and florins we had brought from\r\n\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE SEA WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might not expect to find the Sea Wife in the heart of Kent, but\r\n\r\nthat is where I found her, in a mean street, in the poor quarter of\r\n\r\nMaidstone. In her window she had no sign of lodgings to let, and\r\n\r\npersuasion was necessary before she could bring herself to let me sleep\r\n\r\nin her front room. In the evening I descended to the semi-subterranean\r\n\r\nkitchen, and talked with her and her old man, Thomas Mugridge by name.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as I talked to them, all the subtleties and complexities of this\r\n\r\ntremendous machine civilisation vanished away. It seemed that\r\n\r\nI went down through the skin and the flesh to the naked soul of it,\r\n\r\nand in Thomas Mugridge and his old woman gripped hold of the essence\r\n\r\nof this remarkable English breed. I found there the spirit of\r\n\r\nthe wanderlust which has lured Albion\u2019s sons across the zones;\r\n\r\nand I found there the colossal unreckoning which has tricked the English\r\n\r\ninto foolish squabblings and preposterous fights, and the doggedness\r\n\r\nand stubbornness which have brought them blindly through to empire and\r\n\r\ngreatness; and likewise I found that vast, incomprehensible patience\r\n\r\nwhich has enabled the home population to endure under the burden of\r\n\r\nit all, to toil without complaint through the weary years, and docilely\r\n\r\nto yield the best of its sons to fight and colonise to the ends of the\r\n\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Mugridge was seventy-one years old and a little man.\r\n\r\nIt was because he was little that he had not gone for a soldier.\r\n\r\nHe had remained at home and worked. His first recollections were\r\n\r\nconnected with work. He knew nothing else but work. He had\r\n\r\nworked all his days, and at seventy-one he still worked. Each\r\n\r\nmorning saw him up with the lark and afield, a day labourer, for as\r\n\r\nsuch he had been born. Mrs. Mugridge was seventy-three.\r\n\r\nFrom seven years of age she had worked in the fields, doing a boy\u2019s\r\n\r\nwork at first, and later a man\u2019s. She still worked, keeping\r\n\r\nthe house shining, washing, boiling, and baking, and, with my advent,\r\n\r\ncooking for me and shaming me by making my bed. At the end of\r\n\r\nthreescore years and more of work they possessed nothing, had nothing\r\n\r\nto look forward to save more work. And they were contented.\r\n\r\nThey expected nothing else, desired nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey lived simply. Their wants were few\u2014a pint of beer\r\n\r\nat the end of the day, sipped in the semi-subterranean kitchen, a weekly\r\n\r\npaper to pore over for seven nights hand-running, and conversation as\r\n\r\nmeditative and vacant as the chewing of a heifer\u2019s cud.\r\n\r\nFrom a wood engraving on the wall a slender, angelic girl looked down\r\n\r\nupon them, and underneath was the legend: \u201cOur Future Queen.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd from a highly coloured lithograph alongside looked down a stout\r\n\r\nand elderly lady, with underneath: \u201cOur Queen\u2014Diamond Jubilee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you earn is sweetest,\u201d quoth Mrs. Mugridge, when\r\n\r\nI suggested that it was about time they took a rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, an\u2019 we don\u2019t want help,\u201d said Thomas\r\n\r\nMugridge, in reply to my question as to whether the children lent them\r\n\r\na hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work till we dry up and blow away, mother an\u2019\r\n\r\nme,\u201d he added; and Mrs. Mugridge nodded her head in vigorous indorsement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen children she had borne, and all were away and gone, or dead.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cbaby,\u201d however, lived in Maidstone, and she was twenty-seven.\r\n\r\nWhen the children married they had their hands full with their own families\r\n\r\nand troubles, like their fathers and mothers before them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere were the children? Ah, where were they not? Lizzie\r\n\r\nwas in Australia; Mary was in Buenos Ayres; Poll was in New York; Joe\r\n\r\nhad died in India\u2014and so they called them up, the living and the\r\n\r\ndead, soldier and sailor, and colonist\u2019s wife, for the traveller\u2019s\r\n\r\nsake who sat in their kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey passed me a photograph. A trim young fellow, in soldier\u2019s\r\n\r\ngarb looked out at me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd which son is this?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey laughed a hearty chorus. Son! Nay, grandson, just\r\n\r\nback from Indian service and a soldier-trumpeter to the King.\r\n\r\nHis brother was in the same regiment with him. And so it ran,\r\n\r\nsons and daughters, and grand sons and daughters, world-wanderers and\r\n\r\nempire-builders, all of them, while the old folks stayed at home and\r\n\r\nworked at building empire too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThere dwells a wife by the Northern Gate,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And a wealthy wife is she;\r\n\r\nShe breeds a breed o\u2019 rovin\u2019 men\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And casts them over sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd some are drowned in deep water,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And some in sight of shore;\r\n\r\nAnd word goes back to the weary wife,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And ever she sends more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the Sea Wife\u2019s child-bearing is about done. The stock\r\n\r\nis running out, and the planet is filling up. The wives of her\r\n\r\nsons may carry on the breed, but her work is past. The erstwhile\r\n\r\nmen of England are now the men of Australia, of Africa, of America.\r\n\r\nEngland has sent forth \u201cthe best she breeds\u201d for so long,\r\n\r\nand has destroyed those that remained so fiercely, that little remains\r\n\r\nfor her to do but to sit down through the long nights and gaze at royalty\r\n\r\non the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true British merchant seaman has passed away. The merchant\r\n\r\nservice is no longer a recruiting ground for such sea dogs as fought\r\n\r\nwith Nelson at Trafalgar and the Nile. Foreigners largely man\r\n\r\nthe merchant ships, though Englishmen still continue to officer them\r\n\r\nand to prefer foreigners for\u2019ard. In South Africa the colonial\r\n\r\nteaches the islander how to shoot, and the officers muddle and blunder;\r\n\r\nwhile at home the street people play hysterically at mafficking, and\r\n\r\nthe War Office lowers the stature for enlistment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt could not be otherwise. The most complacent Britisher cannot\r\n\r\nhope to draw off the life-blood, and underfeed, and keep it up forever.\r\n\r\nThe average Mrs. Thomas Mugridge has been driven into the city, and\r\n\r\nshe is not breeding very much of anything save an an\u00e6mic and sickly\r\n\r\nprogeny which cannot find enough to eat. The strength of the English-speaking\r\n\r\nrace to-day is not in the tight little island, but in the New World\r\n\r\noverseas, where are the sons and daughters of Mrs. Thomas Mugridge.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Wife by the Northern Gate has just about done her work in the\r\n\r\nworld, though she does not realize it. She must sit down and rest\r\n\r\nher tired loins for a space; and if the casual ward and the workhouse\r\n\r\ndo not await her, it is because of the sons and daughters she has reared\r\n\r\nup against the day of her feebleness and decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPROPERTY VERSUS PERSON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a civilisation frankly materialistic and based upon property,\r\n\r\nnot soul, it is inevitable that property shall be exalted over soul,\r\n\r\nthat crimes against property shall be considered far more serious than\r\n\r\ncrimes against the person. To pound one\u2019s wife to a jelly\r\n\r\nand break a few of her ribs is a trivial offence compared with sleeping\r\n\r\nout under the naked stars because one has not the price of a doss.\r\n\r\nThe lad who steals a few pears from a wealthy railway corporation is\r\n\r\na greater menace to society than the young brute who commits an unprovoked\r\n\r\nassault upon an old man over seventy years of age. While the young\r\n\r\ngirl who takes a lodging under the pretence that she has work commits\r\n\r\nso dangerous an offence, that, were she not severely punished, she and\r\n\r\nher kind might bring the whole fabric of property clattering to the\r\n\r\nground. Had she unholily tramped Piccadilly and the Strand after\r\n\r\nmidnight, the police would not have interfered with her, and she would\r\n\r\nhave been able to pay for her lodging.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following illustrative cases are culled from the police-court\r\n\r\nreports for a single week:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nWidnes Police Court. Before Aldermen Gossage and\r\n\r\nNeil. Thomas Lynch, charged with being drunk and disorderly and\r\n\r\nwith assaulting a constable. Defendant rescued a woman from custody,\r\n\r\nkicked the constable, and threw stones at him. Fined 3s. 6d. for\r\n\r\nthe first offence, and 10s. and costs for the assault.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlasgow Queen\u2019s Park Police Court. Before Baillie Norman\r\n\r\nThompson. John Kane pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife.\r\n\r\nThere were five previous convictions. Fined \u00a32, 2s.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaunton County Petty Sessions. John Painter, a big, burly fellow,\r\n\r\ndescribed as a labourer, charged with assaulting his wife. The\r\n\r\nwoman received two severe black eyes, and her face was badly swollen.\r\n\r\nFined \u00a31, 8s., including costs, and bound over to keep the peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nWidnes Police Court. Richard Bestwick and George Hunt, charged\r\n\r\nwith trespassing in search of game. Hunt fined \u00a31 and costs,\r\n\r\nBestwick \u00a32 and costs; in default, one month.\r\n\r\n\r\nShaftesbury Police Court. Before the Mayor (Mr. A. T. Carpenter).\r\n\r\nThomas Baker, charged with sleeping out. Fourteen days.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlasgow Central Police Court. Before Bailie Dunlop. Edward\r\n\r\nMorrison, a lad, convicted of stealing fifteen pears from a lorry at\r\n\r\nthe railroad station. Seven days.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoncaster Borough Police Court. Before Alderman Clark and other\r\n\r\nmagistrates. James M\u2019Gowan, charged under the Poaching Prevention\r\n\r\nAct with being found in possession of poaching implements and a number\r\n\r\nof rabbits. Fined \u00a32 and costs, or one month.\r\n\r\n\r\nDunfermline Sheriff Court. Before Sheriff Gillespie.\r\n\r\nJohn Young, a pit-head worker, pleaded guilty to assaulting Alexander\r\n\r\nStorrar by beating him about the head and body with his fists, throwing\r\n\r\nhim on the ground, and also striking him with a pit prop. Fined\r\n\r\n\u00a31.\r\n\r\n\r\nKirkcaldy Police Court. Before Bailie Dishart. Simon\r\n\r\nWalker pleaded guilty to assaulting a man by striking and knocking him\r\n\r\ndown. It was an unprovoked assault, and the magistrate described\r\n\r\nthe accused as a perfect danger to the community. Fined 30s.\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield Police Court. Before the Mayor, Messrs. F. J. Turner,\r\n\r\nJ. Whitaker, F. Tidsbury, E. Holmes, and Dr. R. Nesbitt. Joseph\r\n\r\nJackson, charged with assaulting Charles Nunn. Without any provocation,\r\n\r\ndefendant struck the complainant a violent blow in the face, knocking\r\n\r\nhim down, and then kicked him on the side of the head. He was\r\n\r\nrendered unconscious, and he remained under medical treatment for a\r\n\r\nfortnight. Fined 21s.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerth Sheriff Court. Before Sheriff Sym. David Mitchell,\r\n\r\ncharged with poaching. There were two previous convictions, the\r\n\r\nlast being three years ago.

Prisoner told the magistrate that she would have\r\n\r\nworked had she not had such bad health. Six weeks\u2019 hard\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nINEFFICIENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nI stopped a moment to listen to an argument on the Mile End Waste.\r\n\r\nIt was night-time, and they were all workmen of the better class.\r\n\r\nThey had surrounded one of their number, a pleasant-faced man of thirty,\r\n\r\nand were giving it to him rather heatedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut \u2019ow about this \u2019ere cheap immigration?\u201d\r\n\r\none of them demanded. \u201cThe Jews of Whitechapel, say, a-cutting\r\n\r\nour throats right along?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d was the answer. \u201cThey\u2019re\r\n\r\njust like us, and they\u2019ve got to live. Don\u2019t blame\r\n\r\nthe man who offers to work cheaper than you and gets your job.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut \u2019ow about the wife an\u2019 kiddies?\u201d his\r\n\r\ninterlocutor demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d came the answer. \u201cHow about\r\n\r\nthe wife and kiddies of the man who works cheaper than you and gets\r\n\r\nyour job? Eh? How about his wife and kiddies? He\u2019s\r\n\r\nmore interested in them than in yours, and he can\u2019t see them starve.\r\n\r\nSo he cuts the price of labour and out you go. But you mustn\u2019t\r\n\r\nblame him, poor devil. He can\u2019t help it. Wages always\r\n\r\ncome down when two men are after the same job. That\u2019s the\r\n\r\nfault of competition, not of the man who cuts the price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut wyges don\u2019t come down where there\u2019s a union,\u201d\r\n\r\nthe objection was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd there you are again, right on the head. The union checks competition\r\n\r\namong the labourers, but makes it harder where there are no unions.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s where your cheap labour of Whitechapel comes in. They\u2019re\r\n\r\nunskilled, and have no unions, and cut each other\u2019s throats, and ours in\r\n\r\nthe bargain, if we don\u2019t belong to a strong union.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout going further into the argument, this man on the Mile End\r\n\r\nWaste pointed the moral that when two men were after the one job wages\r\n\r\nwere bound to fall. Had he gone deeper into the matter, he would\r\n\r\nhave found that even the union, say twenty thousand strong, could not\r\n\r\nhold up wages if twenty thousand idle men were trying to displace the\r\n\r\nunion men. This is admirably instanced, just now, by the return\r\n\r\nand disbandment of the soldiers from South Africa. They find themselves,\r\n\r\nby tens of thousands, in desperate straits in the army of the unemployed.\r\n\r\nThere is a general decline in wages throughout the land, which, giving\r\n\r\nrise to labour disputes and strikes, is taken advantage of by the unemployed,\r\n\r\nwho gladly pick up the tools thrown down by the strikers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSweating, starvation wages, armies of unemployed, and great numbers\r\n\r\nof the homeless and shelterless are inevitable when there are more men\r\n\r\nto do work than there is work for men to do. The men and women\r\n\r\nI have met upon the streets, and in the spikes and pegs, are not there\r\n\r\nbecause as a mode of life it may be considered a \u201csoft snap.\u201d\r\n\r\nI have sufficiently outlined the hardships they undergo to demonstrate\r\n\r\nthat their existence is anything but \u201csoft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of sober calculation, here in England, that it is\r\n\r\nsofter to work for twenty shillings a week, and have regular food, and\r\n\r\na bed at night, than it is to walk the streets. The man who walks\r\n\r\nthe streets suffers more, and works harder, for far less return.\r\n\r\nI have depicted the nights they spend, and how, driven in by physical\r\n\r\nexhaustion, they go to the casual ward for a \u201crest up.\u201d\r\n\r\nNor is the casual ward a soft snap. To pick four pounds of oakum,\r\n\r\nbreak twelve hundredweight of stones, or perform the most revolting\r\n\r\ntasks, in return for the miserable food and shelter they receive, is\r\n\r\nan unqualified extravagance on the part of the men who are guilty of\r\n\r\nit. On the part of the authorities it is sheer robbery.\r\n\r\nThey give the men far less for their labour than do the capitalistic\r\n\r\nemployers. The wage for the same amount of labour, performed for\r\n\r\na private employer, would buy them better beds, better food, more good\r\n\r\ncheer, and, above all, greater freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I say, it is an extravagance for a man to patronise a casual ward.\r\n\r\nAnd that they know it themselves is shown by the way these men shun\r\n\r\nit till driven in by physical exhaustion. Then why do they do\r\n\r\nit? Not because they are discouraged workers. The very opposite\r\n\r\nis true; they are discouraged vagabonds. In the United States\r\n\r\nthe tramp is almost invariably a discouraged worker. He finds\r\n\r\ntramping a softer mode of life than working. But this is not true\r\n\r\nin England. Here the powers that be do their utmost to discourage\r\n\r\nthe tramp and vagabond, and he is, in all truth, a mightily discouraged\r\n\r\ncreature. He knows that two shillings a day, which is only fifty\r\n\r\ncents, will buy him three fair meals, a bed at night, and leave him\r\n\r\na couple of pennies for pocket money. He would rather work for\r\n\r\nthose two shillings than for the charity of the casual ward; for he\r\n\r\nknows that he would not have to work so hard, and that he would not\r\n\r\nbe so abominably treated. He does not do so, however, because\r\n\r\nthere are more men to do work than there is work for men to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there are more men than there is work to be done, a sifting-out\r\n\r\nprocess must obtain. In every branch of industry the less efficient\r\n\r\nare crowded out. Being crowded out because of inefficiency, they\r\n\r\ncannot go up, but must descend, and continue to descend, until they\r\n\r\nreach their proper level, a place in the industrial fabric where they\r\n\r\nare efficient. It follows, therefore, and it is inexorable, that\r\n\r\nthe least efficient must descend to the very bottom, which is the shambles\r\n\r\nwherein they perish miserably.\r\n\r\n\r\nA glance at the confirmed inefficients at the bottom demonstrates\r\n\r\nthat they are, as a rule, mental, physical, and moral wrecks.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions to the rule are the late arrivals, who are merely very\r\n\r\ninefficient, and upon whom the wrecking process is just beginning to\r\n\r\noperate. All the forces here, it must be remembered, are destructive.\r\n\r\nThe good body (which is there because its brain is not quick and capable)\r\n\r\nis speedily wrenched and twisted out of shape; the clean mind (which\r\n\r\nis there because of its weak body) is speedily fouled and contaminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mortality is excessive, but, even then, they die far too lingering\r\n\r\ndeaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the construction of the Abyss and the shambles.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole industrial fabric a constant elimination is going\r\n\r\non. The inefficient are weeded out and flung downward. Various\r\n\r\nthings constitute inefficiency. The engineer who is irregular\r\n\r\nor irresponsible will sink down until he finds his place, say as a casual\r\n\r\nlabourer, an occupation irregular in its very nature and in which there\r\n\r\nis little or no responsibility. Those who are slow and clumsy,\r\n\r\nwho suffer from weakness of body or mind, or who lack nervous, mental,\r\n\r\nand physical stamina, must sink down, sometimes rapidly, sometimes step\r\n\r\nby step, to the bottom. Accident, by disabling an efficient worker,\r\n\r\nwill make him inefficient, and down he must go. And the worker\r\n\r\nwho becomes aged, with failing energy and numbing brain, must begin\r\n\r\nthe frightful descent which knows no stopping-place short of the bottom\r\n\r\nand death.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this last instance, the statistics of London tell a terrible tale.\r\n\r\nThe population of London is one-seventh of the total population of the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, and in London, year in and year out, one adult in every\r\n\r\nfour dies on public charity, either in the workhouse, the hospital,\r\n\r\nor the asylum. When the fact that the well-to-do do not end thus\r\n\r\nis taken into consideration, it becomes manifest that it is the fate\r\n\r\nof at least one in every three adult workers to die on public charity.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of how a good worker may suddenly become inefficient,\r\n\r\nand what then happens to him, I am tempted to give the case of M\u2019Garry,\r\n\r\na man thirty-two years of age, and an inmate of the workhouse.\r\n\r\nThe extracts are quoted from the annual report of the trade union.\r\n\r\n\r\nI worked at Sullivan\u2019s place in Widnes, better\r\n\r\nknown as the British Alkali Chemical Works. I was working in a\r\n\r\nshed, and I had to cross the yard. It was ten o\u2019clock at\r\n\r\nnight, and there was no light about. While crossing the yard I\r\n\r\nfelt something take hold of my leg and screw it off. I became\r\n\r\nunconscious; I didn\u2019t know what became of me for a day or two.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday night I came to my senses, and found myself\r\n\r\nin the hospital. I asked the nurse what was to do with my legs,\r\n\r\nand she told me both legs were off.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a stationary crank in the yard, let into the ground; the\r\n\r\nhole was 18 inches long, 15 inches deep, and 15 inches wide. The\r\n\r\ncrank revolved in the hole three revolutions a minute. There was\r\n\r\nno fence or covering over the hole. Since my accident they have\r\n\r\nstopped it altogether, and have covered the hole up with a piece of\r\n\r\nsheet iron. . . . They gave me \u00a325. They didn\u2019t reckon\r\n\r\nthat as compensation; they said it was only for charity\u2019s sake.\r\n\r\nOut of that I paid \u00a39 for a machine by which to wheel myself about.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was labouring at the time I got my legs off. I got twenty-four\r\n\r\nshillings a week, rather better pay than the other men, because I used\r\n\r\nto take shifts. When there was heavy work to be done I used to\r\n\r\nbe picked out to do it. Mr. Manton, the manager, visited me at\r\n\r\nthe hospital several times. When I was getting better, I asked\r\n\r\nhim if he would be able to find me a job. He told me not to trouble\r\n\r\nmyself, as the firm was not cold-hearted. I would be right enough\r\n\r\nin any case . . . Mr. Manton stopped coming to see me; and the last\r\n\r\ntime, he said he thought of asking the directors to give me a fifty-pound\r\n\r\nnote, so I could go home to my friends in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor M\u2019Garry! He received rather better pay than the\r\n\r\nother men because he was ambitious and took shifts, and when heavy work\r\n\r\nwas to be done he was the man picked out to do it. And then the\r\n\r\nthing happened, and he went into the workhouse. The alternative\r\n\r\nto the workhouse is to go home to Ireland and burden his friends for\r\n\r\nthe rest of his life. Comment is superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that efficiency is not determined by the workers\r\n\r\nthemselves, but is determined by the demand for labour. If three\r\n\r\nmen seek one position, the most efficient man will get it. The\r\n\r\nother two, no matter how capable they may be, will none the less be\r\n\r\ninefficients. If Germany, Japan, and the United States should\r\n\r\ncapture the entire world market for iron, coal, and textiles, at once\r\n\r\nthe English workers would be thrown idle by hundreds of thousands.\r\n\r\nSome would emigrate, but the rest would rush their labour into the remaining\r\n\r\nindustries. A general shaking up of the workers from top to bottom\r\n\r\nwould result; and when equilibrium had been restored, the number of\r\n\r\nthe inefficients at the bottom of the Abyss would have been increased\r\n\r\nby hundreds of thousands. On the other hand, conditions remaining\r\n\r\nconstant and all the workers doubling their efficiency, there would\r\n\r\nstill be as many inefficients, though each inefficient were twice as\r\n\r\ncapable as he had been and more capable than many of the efficients\r\n\r\nhad previously been.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there are more men to work than there is work for men to do,\r\n\r\njust as many men as are in excess of work will be inefficients, and\r\n\r\nas inefficients they are doomed to lingering and painful destruction.\r\n\r\nIt shall be the aim of future chapters to show, by their work and manner\r\n\r\nof living, not only how the inefficients are weeded out and destroyed,\r\n\r\nbut to show how inefficients are being constantly and wantonly created\r\n\r\nby the forces of industrial society as it exists to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nWAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I learned that in Lesser London there were 1,292,737 people\r\n\r\nwho received twenty-one shillings or less a week per family, I became\r\n\r\ninterested as to how the wages could best be spent in order to maintain\r\n\r\nthe physical efficiency of such families. Families of six, seven,\r\n\r\neight or ten being beyond consideration, I have based the following\r\n\r\ntable upon a family of five\u2014a father, mother, and three children;\r\n\r\nwhile I have made twenty-one shillings equivalent to $5.25, though actually,\r\n\r\ntwenty-one shillings are equivalent to about $5.11.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn analysis of one item alone will show how little room there is for waste.\r\n\r\nBread, $1: for a family of five, for seven days, one dollar\u2019s\r\n\r\nworth of bread will give each a daily ration of 2.8 cents; and if they eat\r\n\r\nthree meals a day, each may consume per meal 9.5 mills\u2019 worth of bread, a\r\n\r\nlittle less than one halfpennyworth. Now bread is the heaviest item. They will\r\n\r\nget less of meat per mouth each meal, and still less of vegetables; while the\r\n\r\nsmaller items become too microscopic for consideration. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nthese food articles are all bought at small retail, the most expensive and\r\n\r\nwasteful method of purchasing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the table given above will permit no extravagance, no overloading\r\n\r\nof stomachs, it will be noticed that there is no surplus. The\r\n\r\nwhole guinea is spent for food and rent. There is no pocket-money\r\n\r\nleft over. Does the man buy a glass of beer, the family must eat\r\n\r\nthat much less; and in so far as it eats less, just that far will it\r\n\r\nimpair its physical efficiency. The members of this family cannot\r\n\r\nride in busses or trams, cannot write letters, take outings, go to a\r\n\r\n\u201ctu\u2019penny gaff\u201d for cheap vaudeville, join social\r\n\r\nor benefit clubs, nor can they buy sweetmeats, tobacco, books, or newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd further, should one child (and there are three) require a pair\r\n\r\nof shoes, the family must strike meat for a week from its bill of fare.\r\n\r\nAnd since there are five pairs of feet requiring shoes, and five heads\r\n\r\nrequiring hats, and five bodies requiring clothes, and since there are\r\n\r\nlaws regulating indecency, the family must constantly impair its physical\r\n\r\nefficiency in order to keep warm and out of jail. For notice,\r\n\r\nwhen rent, coals, oil, soap, and firewood are extracted from the weekly\r\n\r\nincome, there remains a daily allowance for food of 4.5d. to each person;\r\n\r\nand that 4.5d. cannot be lessened by buying clothes without impairing\r\n\r\nthe physical efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of which is hard enough. But the thing happens; the husband\r\n\r\nand father breaks his leg or his neck. No 4.5d. a day per mouth\r\n\r\nfor food is coming in; no halfpennyworth of bread per meal; and, at\r\n\r\nthe end of the week, no six shillings for rent. So out they must\r\n\r\ngo, to the streets or the workhouse, or to a miserable den, somewhere,\r\n\r\nin which the mother will desperately endeavour to hold the family together\r\n\r\non the ten shillings she may possibly be able to earn.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in London there are 1,292,737 people who receive twenty-one\r\n\r\nshillings or less a week per family, it must be remembered that we have\r\n\r\ninvestigated a family of five living on a twenty-one shilling basis.\r\n\r\nThere are larger families, there are many families that live on less\r\n\r\nthan twenty-one shillings, and there is much irregular employment.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, How do they live? The answer\r\n\r\nis that they do not live. They do not know what life is.\r\n\r\nThey drag out a subterbestial existence until mercifully released by\r\n\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore descending to the fouler depths, let the case of the telephone\r\n\r\ngirls be cited. Here are clean, fresh English maids, for whom\r\n\r\na higher standard of living than that of the beasts is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nOtherwise they cannot remain clean, fresh English maids. On entering\r\n\r\nthe service, a telephone girl receives a weekly wage of eleven shillings.\r\n\r\nIf she be quick and clever, she may, at the end of five years, attain\r\n\r\na minimum wage of one pound. Recently a table of such a girl\u2019s\r\n\r\nweekly expenditure was furnished to Lord Londonderry. Here it\r\n\r\nis:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leaves nothing for clothes, recreation, or sickness. And\r\n\r\nyet many of the girls are receiving, not eighteen shillings, but eleven\r\n\r\nshillings, twelve shillings, and fourteen shillings per week.\r\n\r\nThey must have clothes and recreation, and\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nMan to Man so oft unjust,\r\n\r\nIs always so to Woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Trades Union Congress now being held in London, the Gasworkers\u2019\r\n\r\nUnion moved that instructions be given the Parliamentary Committee to\r\n\r\nintroduce a Bill to prohibit the employment of children under fifteen\r\n\r\nyears of age. Mr. Shackleton, Member of Parliament and a representative\r\n\r\nof the Northern Counties Weavers, opposed the resolution on behalf of\r\n\r\nthe textile workers, who, he said, could not dispense with the earnings\r\n\r\nof their children and live on the scale of wages which obtained.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of 514,000 workers voted against the resolution,\r\n\r\nwhile the representatives of 535,000 workers voted in favour of it.\r\n\r\nWhen 514,000 workers oppose a resolution prohibiting child-labour under\r\n\r\nfifteen, it is evident that a less-than-living wage is being paid to\r\n\r\nan immense number of the adult workers of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have spoken with women in Whitechapel who receive right along less\r\n\r\nthan one shilling for a twelve-hour day in the coat-making sweat shops;\r\n\r\nand with women trousers finishers who receive an average princely and\r\n\r\nweekly wage of three to four shillings.\r\n\r\n\r\nA case recently cropped up of men, in the employ of a wealthy business\r\n\r\nhouse, receiving their board and six shillings per week for six working\r\n\r\ndays of sixteen hours each. The sandwich men get fourteenpence\r\n\r\nper day and find themselves. The average weekly earnings of the\r\n\r\nhawkers and costermongers are not more than ten to twelve shillings.\r\n\r\nThe average of all common labourers, outside the dockers, is less than\r\n\r\nsixteen shillings per week, while the dockers average from eight to\r\n\r\nnine shillings. These figures are taken from a royal commission\r\n\r\nreport and are authentic.\r\n\r\n\r\nConceive of an old woman, broken and dying, supporting herself and four\r\n\r\nchildren, and paying three shillings per week rent, by making match boxes at\r\n\r\n2.25d. per gross. Twelve dozen boxes for 2.25d., and, in addition, finding her\r\n\r\nown paste and thread! She never knew a day off, either for sickness, rest, or\r\n\r\nrecreation. Each day and every day, Sundays as well, she toiled fourteen hours.\r\n\r\nHer day\u2019s stint was seven gross, for which she received 1s. 3.75d. In the\r\n\r\nweek of ninety-eight hours\u2019 work, she made 7066 match boxes, and earned\r\n\r\n4s. 10.25d., less her paste and thread.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year, Mr. Thomas Holmes, a police-court missionary of note,\r\n\r\nafter writing about the condition of the women workers, received the\r\n\r\nfollowing letter, dated April 18, 1901:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\u2014Pardon the liberty I am taking, but, having read what you said about\r\n\r\npoor women working fourteen hours a day for ten shillings per week, I beg to\r\n\r\nstate my case. I am a tie-maker, who, after working all the week, cannot earn\r\n\r\nmore than five shillings, and I have a poor afflicted husband to keep who\r\n\r\nhasn\u2019t earned a penny for more than ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine a woman, capable of writing such a clear, sensible, grammatical\r\n\r\nletter, supporting her husband and self on five shillings per week!\r\n\r\nMr. Holmes visited her. He had to squeeze to get into the room.\r\n\r\nThere lay her sick husband; there she worked all day long; there she\r\n\r\ncooked, ate, washed, and slept; and there her husband and she performed\r\n\r\nall the functions of living and dying. There was no space for\r\n\r\nthe missionary to sit down, save on the bed, which was partially covered\r\n\r\nwith ties and silk. The sick man\u2019s lungs were in the last\r\n\r\nstages of decay. He coughed and expectorated constantly, the woman\r\n\r\nceasing from her work to assist him in his paroxysms. The silken\r\n\r\nfluff from the ties was not good for his sickness; nor was his sickness\r\n\r\ngood for the ties, and the handlers and wearers of the ties yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother case Mr. Holmes visited was that of a young girl, twelve\r\n\r\nyears of age, charged in the police court with stealing food.\r\n\r\nHe found her the deputy mother of a boy of nine, a crippled boy of seven,\r\n\r\nand a younger child. Her mother was a widow and a blouse-maker.\r\n\r\nShe paid five shillings a week rent. Here are the last items in\r\n\r\nher housekeeping account: Tea. 0.5d.; sugar, 0.5d.; bread, 0.25d.; margarine,\r\n\r\n1d.; oil, 1.5d.; and firewood, 1d. Good housewives of the soft\r\n\r\nand tender folk, imagine yourselves marketing and keeping house on such\r\n\r\na scale, setting a table for five, and keeping an eye on your deputy\r\n\r\nmother of twelve to see that she did not steal food for her little brothers\r\n\r\nand sisters, the while you stitched, stitched, stitched at a nightmare\r\n\r\nline of blouses, which stretched away into the gloom and down to the\r\n\r\npauper\u2019s coffin a-yawn for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE GHETTO\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it well that while we range with Science, glorying in the time,\r\n\r\nCity children soak and blacken soul and sense in city slime?\r\n\r\nThere among the gloomy alleys Progress halts on palsied feet;\r\n\r\nCrime and hunger cast out maidens by the thousand on the street;\r\n\r\n\r\nThere the master scrimps his haggard seamstress of her daily bread;\r\n\r\nThere the single sordid attic holds the living and the dead;\r\n\r\nThere the smouldering fire of fever creeps across the rotted floor,\r\n\r\nAnd the crowded couch of incest, in the warrens of the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one time the nations of Europe confined the undesirable Jews in\r\n\r\ncity ghettos. But to-day the dominant economic class, by less\r\n\r\narbitrary but none the less rigorous methods, has confined the undesirable\r\n\r\nyet necessary workers into ghettos of remarkable meanness and vastness.\r\n\r\nEast London is such a ghetto, where the rich and the powerful do not\r\n\r\ndwell, and the traveller cometh not, and where two million workers swarm,\r\n\r\nprocreate, and die.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that all the workers of London are crowded\r\n\r\ninto the East End, but the tide is setting strongly in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe poor quarters of the city proper are constantly being destroyed,\r\n\r\nand the main stream of the unhoused is toward the east. In the\r\n\r\nlast twelve years, one district, \u201cLondon over the Border,\u201d\r\n\r\nas it is called, which lies well beyond Aldgate, Whitechapel, and Mile\r\n\r\nEnd, has increased 260,000, or over sixty per cent. The churches\r\n\r\nin this district, by the way, can seat but one in every thirty-seven\r\n\r\nof the added population.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City of Dreadful Monotony, the East End is often called, especially\r\n\r\nby well-fed, optimistic sightseers, who look over the surface of things\r\n\r\nand are merely shocked by the intolerable sameness and meanness of it\r\n\r\nall. If the East End is worthy of no worse title than The City\r\n\r\nof Dreadful Monotony, and if working people are unworthy of variety\r\n\r\nand beauty and surprise, it would not be such a bad place in which to\r\n\r\nlive. But the East End does merit a worse title. It should\r\n\r\nbe called The City of Degradation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is not a city of slums, as some people imagine, it may well\r\n\r\nbe said to be one gigantic slum. From the standpoint of simple\r\n\r\ndecency and clean manhood and womanhood, any mean street, of all its\r\n\r\nmean streets, is a slum. Where sights and sounds abound which\r\n\r\nneither you nor I would care to have our children see and hear is a\r\n\r\nplace where no man\u2019s children should live, and see, and hear.\r\n\r\nWhere you and I would not care to have our wives pass their lives is\r\n\r\na place where no other man\u2019s wife should have to pass her life.\r\n\r\nFor here, in the East End, the obscenities and brute vulgarities of\r\n\r\nlife are rampant. There is no privacy. The bad corrupts\r\n\r\nthe good, and all fester together. Innocent childhood is sweet\r\n\r\nand beautiful: but in East London innocence is a fleeting thing, and\r\n\r\nyou must catch them before they crawl out of the cradle, or you will\r\n\r\nfind the very babes as unholily wise as you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of the Golden Rule determines that East London is\r\n\r\nan unfit place in which to live. Where you would not have your\r\n\r\nown babe live, and develop, and gather to itself knowledge of life and\r\n\r\nthe things of life, is not a fit place for the babes of other men to\r\n\r\nlive, and develop, and gather to themselves knowledge of life and the\r\n\r\nthings of life. It is a simple thing, this Golden Rule, and all\r\n\r\nthat is required. Political economy and the survival of the fittest\r\n\r\ncan go hang if they say otherwise. What is not good enough for\r\n\r\nyou is not good enough for other men, and there\u2019s no more to be\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 300,000 people in London, divided into families, that live\r\n\r\nin one-room tenements. Far, far more live in two and three rooms\r\n\r\nand are as badly crowded, regardless of sex, as those that live in one\r\n\r\nroom. The law demands 400 cubic feet of space for each person.\r\n\r\nIn army barracks each soldier is allowed 600 cubic feet. Professor\r\n\r\nHuxley, at one time himself a medical officer in East London, always\r\n\r\nheld that each person should have 800 cubic feet of space, and that\r\n\r\nit should be well ventilated with pure air. Yet in London there\r\n\r\nare 900,000 people living in less than the 400 cubic feet prescribed\r\n\r\nby the law.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Booth, who engaged in a systematic work of years in charting\r\n\r\nand classifying the toiling city population, estimates that there are\r\n\r\n1,800,000 people in London who are poor and very poor.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to mark what he terms poor. By poor he\r\n\r\nmeans families which have a total weekly income of from eighteen to\r\n\r\ntwenty-one shillings. The very poor fall greatly below\r\n\r\nthis standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workers, as a class, are being more and more segregated by their economic\r\n\r\nmasters; and this process, with its jamming and overcrowding, tends not so much\r\n\r\ntoward immorality as unmorality. Here is an extract from a recent meeting of\r\n\r\nthe London County Council, terse and bald, but with a wealth of horror to be\r\n\r\nread between the lines:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bruce asked the Chairman of the Public Health Committee whether his\r\n\r\nattention had been called to a number of cases of serious overcrowding in the\r\n\r\nEast End. In St. Georges-in-the-East a man and his wife and their family of\r\n\r\neight occupied one small room. This family consisted of five daughters, aged\r\n\r\ntwenty, seventeen, eight, four, and an infant; and three sons, aged fifteen,\r\n\r\nthirteen, and twelve. In Whitechapel a man and his wife and their three\r\n\r\ndaughters, aged sixteen, eight, and four, and two sons, aged ten and twelve\r\n\r\nyears, occupied a smaller room. In Bethnal Green a man and his wife, with four\r\n\r\nsons, aged twenty-three, twenty-one, nineteen, and sixteen, and two daughters,\r\n\r\naged fourteen and seven, were also found in one room. He asked whether it was\r\n\r\nnot the duty of the various local authorities to prevent such serious\r\n\r\novercrowding.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut with 900,000 people actually living under illegal conditions,\r\n\r\nthe authorities have their hands full. When the overcrowded folk\r\n\r\nare ejected they stray off into some other hole; and, as they move their\r\n\r\nbelongings by night, on hand-barrows (one hand-barrow accommodating\r\n\r\nthe entire household goods and the sleeping children), it is next to\r\n\r\nimpossible to keep track of them. If the Public Health Act of\r\n\r\n1891 were suddenly and completely enforced, 900,000 people would receive\r\n\r\nnotice to clear out of their houses and go on to the streets, and 500,000\r\n\r\nrooms would have to be built before they were all legally housed again.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mean streets merely look mean from the outside, but inside the\r\n\r\nwalls are to be found squalor, misery, and tragedy. While the\r\n\r\nfollowing tragedy may be revolting to read, it must not be forgotten\r\n\r\nthat the existence of it is far more revolting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire Place, Lisson Grove, a short while back died an old\r\n\r\nwoman of seventy-five years of age. At the inquest the coroner\u2019s\r\n\r\nofficer stated that \u201call he found in the room was a lot of old\r\n\r\nrags covered with vermin. He had got himself smothered with the\r\n\r\nvermin. The room was in a shocking condition, and he had never\r\n\r\nseen anything like it. Everything was absolutely covered with\r\n\r\nvermin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor said: \u201cHe found deceased lying across the fender\r\n\r\non her back. She had one garment and her stockings on. The\r\n\r\nbody was quite alive with vermin, and all the clothes in the room were\r\n\r\nabsolutely grey with insects. Deceased was very badly nourished\r\n\r\nand was very emaciated. She had extensive sores on her legs, and\r\n\r\nher stockings were adherent to those sores. The sores were the\r\n\r\nresult of vermin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA man present at the inquest wrote: \u201cI had the evil fortune\r\n\r\nto see the body of the unfortunate woman as it lay in the mortuary;\r\n\r\nand even now the memory of that gruesome sight makes me shudder.\r\n\r\nThere she lay in the mortuary shell, so starved and emaciated that she\r\n\r\nwas a mere bundle of skin and bones. Her hair, which was matted\r\n\r\nwith filth, was simply a nest of vermin. Over her bony chest leaped\r\n\r\nand rolled hundreds, thousands, myriads of vermin!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is not good for your mother and my mother so to die, then it\r\n\r\nis not good for this woman, whosoever\u2019s mother she might be, so\r\n\r\nto die.\r\n\r\n\r\nBishop Wilkinson, who has lived in Zululand, recently said, \u201cNo\r\n\r\nhuman of an African village would allow such a promiscuous mixing of\r\n\r\nyoung men and women, boys and girls.\u201d He had reference to\r\n\r\nthe children of the overcrowded folk, who at five have nothing to learn\r\n\r\nand much to unlearn which they will never unlearn.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that here in the Ghetto the houses of the poor are\r\n\r\ngreater profit earners than the mansions of the rich. Not only\r\n\r\ndoes the poor worker have to live like a beast, but he pays proportionately\r\n\r\nmore for it than does the rich man for his spacious comfort. A\r\n\r\nclass of house-sweaters has been made possible by the competition of\r\n\r\nthe poor for houses. There are more people than there is room,\r\n\r\nand numbers are in the workhouse because they cannot find shelter elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNot only are houses let, but they are sublet, and sub-sublet down to\r\n\r\nthe very rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cA part of a room to let.\u201d This notice was posted\r\n\r\na short while ago in a window not five minutes\u2019 walk from St.\r\n\r\nJames\u2019s Hall. The Rev. Hugh Price Hughes is authority for\r\n\r\nthe statement that beds are let on the three-relay system\u2014that\r\n\r\nis, three tenants to a bed, each occupying it eight hours, so that it\r\n\r\nnever grows cold; while the floor space underneath the bed is likewise\r\n\r\nlet on the three-relay system. Health officers are not at all\r\n\r\nunused to finding such cases as the following: in one room having a\r\n\r\ncubic capacity of 1000 feet, three adult females in the bed, and two\r\n\r\nadult females under the bed; and in one room of 1650 cubic feet, one\r\n\r\nadult male and two children in the bed, and two adult females under\r\n\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a typical example of a room on the more respectable two-relay\r\n\r\nsystem. It is occupied in the daytime by a young woman employed\r\n\r\nall night in a hotel. At seven o\u2019clock in the evening she\r\n\r\nvacates the room, and a bricklayer\u2019s labourer comes in.\r\n\r\nAt seven in the morning he vacates, and goes to his work, at which time\r\n\r\nshe returns from hers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. N. Davies, rector of Spitalfields, took a census of some of the\r\n\r\nalleys in his parish. He says:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one alley there are ten houses\u2014fifty-one rooms, nearly all about 8\r\n\r\nfeet by 9 feet\u2014and 254 people. In six instances only do 2 people occupy\r\n\r\none room; and in others the number varied from 3 to 9. In another court with\r\n\r\nsix houses and twenty-two rooms were 84 people\u2014again 6, 7, 8, and 9 being\r\n\r\nthe number living in one room, in several instances. In one house with eight\r\n\r\nrooms are 45 people\u2014one room containing 9 persons, one 8, two 7, and\r\n\r\nanother 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Ghetto crowding is not through inclination, but compulsion.\r\n\r\nNearly fifty per cent. of the workers pay from one-fourth to one-half\r\n\r\nof their earnings for rent. The average rent in the larger part\r\n\r\nof the East End is from four to six shillings per week for one room,\r\n\r\nwhile skilled mechanics, earning thirty-five shillings per week, are\r\n\r\nforced to part with fifteen shillings of it for two or three pokey little\r\n\r\ndens, in which they strive desperately to obtain some semblance of home\r\n\r\nlife. And rents are going up all the time. In one street\r\n\r\nin Stepney the increase in only two years has been from thirteen to\r\n\r\neighteen shillings; in another street from eleven to sixteen shillings;\r\n\r\nand in another street, from eleven to fifteen shillings; while in Whitechapel,\r\n\r\ntwo-room houses that recently rented for ten shillings are now costing\r\n\r\ntwenty-one shillings. East, west, north, and south the rents are\r\n\r\ngoing up. When land is worth from \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000\r\n\r\nan acre, some one must pay the landlord.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. W. C. Steadman, in the House of Commons, in a speech concerning his\r\n\r\nconstituency in Stepney, related the following:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nThis morning, not a hundred yards from where I am myself living, a widow\r\n\r\nstopped me. She has six children to support, and the rent of her house was\r\n\r\nfourteen shillings per week. She gets her living by letting the house to\r\n\r\nlodgers and doing a day\u2019s washing or charring. That woman, with tears in\r\n\r\nher eyes, told me that the landlord had increased the rent from fourteen\r\n\r\nshillings to eighteen shillings. What could the woman do? There is no\r\n\r\naccommodation in Stepney. Every place is taken up and overcrowded.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass supremacy can rest only on class degradation; and when the workers are\r\n\r\nsegregated in the Ghetto, they cannot escape the consequent degradation. A\r\n\r\nshort and stunted people is created\u2014a breed strikingly differentiated\r\n\r\nfrom their masters\u2019 breed, a pavement folk, as it were, lacking stamina\r\n\r\nand strength. The men become caricatures of what physical men ought to be, and\r\n\r\ntheir women and children are pale and an\u00e6mic, with eyes ringed darkly, who\r\n\r\nstoop and slouch, and are early twisted out of all shapeliness and beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the men of the Ghetto are the men who are\r\n\r\nleft\u2014a deteriorated stock, left to undergo still further deterioration.\r\n\r\nFor a hundred and fifty years, at least, they have been drained of their\r\n\r\nbest. The strong men, the men of pluck, initiative, and ambition,\r\n\r\nhave been faring forth to the fresher and freer portions of the globe,\r\n\r\nto make new lands and nations. Those who are lacking, the weak\r\n\r\nof heart and head and hand, as well as the rotten and hopeless, have\r\n\r\nremained to carry on the breed. And year by year, in turn, the\r\n\r\nbest they breed are taken from them. Wherever a man of vigour\r\n\r\nand stature manages to grow up, he is haled forthwith into the army.\r\n\r\nA soldier, as Bernard Shaw has said, \u201costensibly a heroic and\r\n\r\npatriotic defender of his country, is really an unfortunate man driven\r\n\r\nby destitution to offer himself as food for powder for the sake of regular\r\n\r\nrations, shelter, and clothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis constant selection of the best from the workers has impoverished\r\n\r\nthose who are left, a sadly degraded remainder, for the great part,\r\n\r\nwhich, in the Ghetto, sinks to the deepest depths. The wine of\r\n\r\nlife has been drawn off to spill itself in blood and progeny over the\r\n\r\nrest of the earth. Those that remain are the lees, and they are\r\n\r\nsegregated and steeped in themselves. They become indecent and\r\n\r\nbestial. When they kill, they kill with their hands, and then\r\n\r\nstupidly surrender themselves to the executioners. There is no\r\n\r\nsplendid audacity about their transgressions. They gouge a mate\r\n\r\nwith a dull knife, or beat his head in with an iron pot, and then sit\r\n\r\ndown and wait for the police. Wife-beating is the masculine prerogative\r\n\r\nof matrimony. They wear remarkable boots of brass and iron, and\r\n\r\nwhen they have polished off the mother of their children with a black\r\n\r\neye or so, they knock her down and proceed to trample her very much\r\n\r\nas a Western stallion tramples a rattlesnake.\r\n\r\n\r\nA woman of the lower Ghetto classes is as much the slave of her husband\r\n\r\nas is the Indian squaw. And I, for one, were I a woman and had\r\n\r\nbut the two choices, should prefer being a squaw. The men are\r\n\r\neconomically dependent on their masters, and the women are economically\r\n\r\ndependent on the men. The result is, the woman gets the beating\r\n\r\nthe man should give his master, and she can do nothing. There\r\n\r\nare the kiddies, and he is the bread-winner, and she dare not send him\r\n\r\nto jail and leave herself and children to starve. Evidence to\r\n\r\nconvict can rarely be obtained when such cases come into the courts;\r\n\r\nas a rule, the trampled wife and mother is weeping and hysterically\r\n\r\nbeseeching the magistrate to let her husband off for the kiddies\u2019\r\n\r\nsakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wives become screaming harridans or, broken-spirited and doglike,\r\n\r\nlose what little decency and self-respect they have remaining over from\r\n\r\ntheir maiden days, and all sink together, unheeding, in their degradation\r\n\r\nand dirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes I become afraid of my own generalizations upon the massed\r\n\r\nmisery of this Ghetto life, and feel that my impressions are exaggerated,\r\n\r\nthat I am too close to the picture and lack perspective. At such\r\n\r\nmoments I find it well to turn to the testimony of other men to prove\r\n\r\nto myself that I am not becoming over-wrought and addle-pated.\r\n\r\nFrederick Harrison has always struck me as being a level-headed, well-controlled\r\n\r\nman, and he says:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me, at least, it would be enough to condemn modern society as hardly an\r\n\r\nadvance on slavery or serfdom, if the permanent condition of industry were to\r\n\r\nbe that which we behold, that ninety per cent. of the actual producers of\r\n\r\nwealth have no home that they can call their own beyond the end of the week;\r\n\r\nhave no bit of soil, or so much as a room that belongs to them; have nothing of\r\n\r\nvalue of any kind, except as much old furniture as will go into a cart; have\r\n\r\nthe precarious chance of weekly wages, which barely suffice to keep them in\r\n\r\nhealth; are housed, for the most part, in places that no man thinks fit for his\r\n\r\nhorse; are separated by so narrow a margin from destitution that a month of bad\r\n\r\ntrade, sickness, or unexpected loss brings them face to face with hunger and\r\n\r\npauperism . . . But below this normal state of the average workman in town and\r\n\r\ncountry, there is found the great band of destitute outcasts\u2014the camp\r\n\r\nfollowers of the army of industry\u2014at least one-tenth the whole\r\n\r\nproletarian population, whose normal condition is one of sickening\r\n\r\nwretchedness. If this is to be the permanent arrangement of modern society,\r\n\r\ncivilization must be held to bring a curse on the great majority of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nNinety per cent.! The figures are appalling, yet Mr. Stopford\r\n\r\nBrooke, after drawing a frightful London picture, finds himself compelled\r\n\r\nto multiply it by half a million. Here it is:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nI often used to meet, when I was curate at Kensington, families drifting into\r\n\r\nLondon along the Hammersmith Road. One day there came along a labourer and his\r\n\r\nwife, his son and two daughters. Their family had lived for a long time on an\r\n\r\nestate in the country, and managed, with the help of the common-land and their\r\n\r\nlabour, to get on. But the time came when the common was encroached upon, and\r\n\r\ntheir labour was not needed on the estate, and they were quietly turned out of\r\n\r\ntheir cottage. Where should they go? Of course to London, where work was\r\n\r\nthought to be plentiful. They had a little savings, and they thought they could\r\n\r\nget two decent rooms to live in. But the inexorable land question met them in\r\n\r\nLondon. They tried the decent courts for lodgings, and found that two rooms\r\n\r\nwould cost ten shillings a week. Food was dear and bad, water was bad, and in a\r\n\r\nshort time their health suffered. Work was hard to get, and its wage was so low\r\n\r\nthat they were soon in debt. They became more ill and more despairing with the\r\n\r\npoisonous surroundings, the darkness, and the long hours of work; and they were\r\n\r\ndriven forth to seek a cheaper lodging. They found it in a court I knew\r\n\r\nwell\u2014a hotbed of crime and nameless horrors. In this they got a single\r\n\r\nroom at a cruel rent, and work was more difficult for them to get now, as they\r\n\r\ncame from a place of such bad repute, and they fell into the hands of those who\r\n\r\nsweat the last drop out of man and woman and child, for wages which are the\r\n\r\nfood only of despair. And the darkness and the dirt, the bad food and the\r\n\r\nsickness, and the want of water was worse than before; and the crowd and the\r\n\r\ncompanionship of the court robbed them of the last shreds of self-respect. The\r\n\r\ndrink demon seized upon them. Of course there was a public-house at both ends\r\n\r\nof the court. There they fled, one and all, for shelter, and warmth, and\r\n\r\nsociety, and forgetfulness. And they came out in deeper debt, with inflamed\r\n\r\nsenses and burning brains, and an unsatisfied craving for drink they would do\r\n\r\nanything to satiate. And in a few months the father was in prison, the wife\r\n\r\ndying, the son a criminal, and the daughters on the street. Multiply this by\r\n\r\nhalf a million, and you will be beneath the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more dreary spectacle can be found on this earth than the whole\r\n\r\nof the \u201cawful East,\u201d with its Whitechapel, Hoxton, Spitalfields,\r\n\r\nBethnal Green, and Wapping to the East India Docks. The colour\r\n\r\nof life is grey and drab. Everything is helpless, hopeless, unrelieved,\r\n\r\nand dirty. Bath tubs are a thing totally unknown, as mythical\r\n\r\nas the ambrosia of the gods. The people themselves are dirty,\r\n\r\nwhile any attempt at cleanliness becomes howling farce, when it is not\r\n\r\npitiful and tragic. Strange, vagrant odours come drifting along\r\n\r\nthe greasy wind, and the rain, when it falls, is more like grease than\r\n\r\nwater from heaven. The very cobblestones are scummed with grease.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere lives a population as dull and unimaginative as its long grey\r\n\r\nmiles of dingy brick. Religion has virtually passed it by, and\r\n\r\na gross and stupid materialism reigns, fatal alike to the things of\r\n\r\nthe spirit and the finer instincts of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt used to be the proud boast that every Englishman\u2019s home\r\n\r\nwas his castle. But to-day it is an anachronism. The Ghetto\r\n\r\nfolk have no homes. They do not know the significance and the\r\n\r\nsacredness of home life. Even the municipal dwellings, where live\r\n\r\nthe better-class workers, are overcrowded barracks. They have\r\n\r\nno home life. The very language proves it. The father returning\r\n\r\nfrom work asks his child in the street where her mother is; and back\r\n\r\nthe answer comes, \u201cIn the buildings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA new race has sprung up, a street people. They pass their\r\n\r\nlives at work and in the streets. They have dens and lairs into\r\n\r\nwhich to crawl for sleeping purposes, and that is all. One cannot\r\n\r\ntravesty the word by calling such dens and lairs \u201chomes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe traditional silent and reserved Englishman has passed away.\r\n\r\nThe pavement folk are noisy, voluble, high-strung, excitable\u2014when\r\n\r\nthey are yet young. As they grow older they become steeped and\r\n\r\nstupefied in beer. When they have nothing else to do, they ruminate\r\n\r\nas a cow ruminates. They are to be met with everywhere, standing\r\n\r\non curbs and corners, and staring into vacancy. Watch one of them.\r\n\r\nHe will stand there, motionless, for hours, and when you go away you\r\n\r\nwill leave him still staring into vacancy. It is most absorbing.\r\n\r\nHe has no money for beer, and his lair is only for sleeping purposes,\r\n\r\nso what else remains for him to do? He has already solved the\r\n\r\nmysteries of girl\u2019s love, and wife\u2019s love, and child\u2019s\r\n\r\nlove, and found them delusions and shams, vain and fleeting as dew-drops,\r\n\r\nquick-vanishing before the ferocious facts of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I say, the young are high-strung, nervous, excitable; the middle-aged\r\n\r\nare empty-headed, stolid, and stupid. It is absurd to think for\r\n\r\nan instant that they can compete with the workers of the New World.\r\n\r\nBrutalised, degraded, and dull, the Ghetto folk will be unable to render\r\n\r\nefficient service to England in the world struggle for industrial supremacy\r\n\r\nwhich economists declare has already begun. Neither as workers\r\n\r\nnor as soldiers can they come up to the mark when England, in her need,\r\n\r\ncalls upon them, her forgotten ones; and if England be flung out of\r\n\r\nthe world\u2019s industrial orbit, they will perish like flies at the\r\n\r\nend of summer. Or, with England critically situated, and with\r\n\r\nthem made desperate as wild beasts are made desperate, they may become\r\n\r\na menace and go \u201cswelling\u201d down to the West End to return\r\n\r\nthe \u201cslumming\u201d the West End has done in the East.\r\n\r\nIn which case, before rapid-fire guns and the modern machinery of warfare,\r\n\r\nthey will perish the more swiftly and easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE-HOUSES AND DOSS-HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother phrase gone glimmering, shorn of romance and tradition and\r\n\r\nall that goes to make phrases worth keeping! For me, henceforth,\r\n\r\n\u201ccoffee-house\u201d will possess anything but an agreeable connotation.\r\n\r\nOver on the other side of the world, the mere mention of the word was\r\n\r\nsufficient to conjure up whole crowds of its historic frequenters, and\r\n\r\nto send trooping through my imagination endless groups of wits and dandies,\r\n\r\npamphleteers and bravos, and bohemians of Grub Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut here, on this side of the world, alas and alack, the very name\r\n\r\nis a misnomer. Coffee-house: a place where people drink coffee.\r\n\r\nNot at all. You cannot obtain coffee in such a place for love\r\n\r\nor money. True, you may call for coffee, and you will have brought\r\n\r\nyou something in a cup purporting to be coffee, and you will taste it\r\n\r\nand be disillusioned, for coffee it certainly is not.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of the coffee is true of the coffee-house.\r\n\r\nWorking-men, in the main, frequent these places, and greasy, dirty places\r\n\r\nthey are, without one thing about them to cherish decency in a man or\r\n\r\nput self-respect into him. Table-cloths and napkins are unknown.\r\n\r\nA man eats in the midst of the d\u00e9bris left by his predecessor,\r\n\r\nand dribbles his own scraps about him and on the floor. In rush\r\n\r\ntimes, in such places, I have positively waded through the muck and\r\n\r\nmess that covered the floor, and I have managed to eat because I was\r\n\r\nabominably hungry and capable of eating anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the normal condition of the working-man, from the zest with\r\n\r\nwhich he addresses himself to the board. Eating is a necessity, and there are\r\n\r\nno frills about it. He brings in with him a primitive voraciousness, and, I am\r\n\r\nconfident, carries away with him a fairly healthy appetite. When you see such a\r\n\r\nman, on his way to work in the morning, order a pint of tea, which is no more\r\n\r\ntea than it is ambrosia, pull a hunk of dry bread from his pocket, and wash the\r\n\r\none down with the other, depend upon it, that man has not the right sort of\r\n\r\nstuff in his belly, nor enough of the wrong sort of stuff, to fit him for his\r\n\r\nday\u2019s work. And further, depend upon it, he and a thousand of his kind\r\n\r\nwill not turn out the quantity or quality of work that a thousand men will who\r\n\r\nhave eaten heartily of meat and potatoes, and drunk coffee that is coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a vagrant in the \u201cHobo\u201d of a California jail, I have\r\n\r\nbeen served better food and drink than the London workman receives in\r\n\r\nhis coffee-houses; while as an American labourer I have eaten a breakfast\r\n\r\nfor twelvepence such as the British labourer would not dream of eating.\r\n\r\nOf course, he will pay only three or four pence for his; which is, however,\r\n\r\nas much as I paid, for I would be earning six shillings to his two or\r\n\r\ntwo and a half. On the other hand, though, and in return, I would\r\n\r\nturn out an amount of work in the course of the day that would put to\r\n\r\nshame the amount he turned out. So there are two sides to it.\r\n\r\nThe man with the high standard of living will always do more work and\r\n\r\nbetter than the man with the low standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a comparison which sailormen make between the English and American\r\n\r\nmerchant services. In an English ship, they say, it is poor grub, poor pay, and\r\n\r\neasy work; in an American ship, good grub, good pay, and hard work. And this is\r\n\r\napplicable to the working populations of both countries. The ocean greyhounds\r\n\r\nhave to pay for speed and steam, and so does the workman. But if the workman is\r\n\r\nnot able to pay for it, he will not have the speed and steam, that is all. The\r\n\r\nproof of it is when the English workman comes to America. He will lay more\r\n\r\nbricks in New York than he will in London, still more bricks in St. Louis, and\r\n\r\nstill more bricks when he gets to San Francisco.[3]\r\n\r\nHis standard of living has been rising all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3]\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco bricklayer receives twenty shillings per day, and at present\r\n\r\nis on strike for twenty-four shillings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, along the streets frequented by workmen on\r\n\r\nthe way to work, many women sit on the sidewalk with sacks of bread\r\n\r\nbeside them. No end of workmen purchase these, and eat them as\r\n\r\nthey walk along. They do not even wash the dry bread down with\r\n\r\nthe tea to be obtained for a penny in the coffee-houses. It is\r\n\r\nincontestable that a man is not fit to begin his day\u2019s work on\r\n\r\na meal like that; and it is equally incontestable that the loss will\r\n\r\nfall upon his employer and upon the nation. For some time, now,\r\n\r\nstatesmen have been crying, \u201cWake up, England!\u201d It\r\n\r\nwould show more hard-headed common sense if they changed the tune to\r\n\r\n\u201cFeed up, England!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only is the worker poorly fed, but he is filthily fed.\r\n\r\nI have stood outside a butcher-shop and watched a horde of speculative\r\n\r\nhousewives turning over the trimmings and scraps and shreds of beef\r\n\r\nand mutton\u2014dog-meat in the States. I would not vouch for\r\n\r\nthe clean fingers of these housewives, no more than I would vouch for\r\n\r\nthe cleanliness of the single rooms in which many of them and their\r\n\r\nfamilies lived; yet they raked, and pawed, and scraped the mess about\r\n\r\nin their anxiety to get the worth of their coppers. I kept my\r\n\r\neye on one particularly offensive-looking bit of meat, and followed\r\n\r\nit through the clutches of over twenty women, till it fell to the lot\r\n\r\nof a timid-appearing little woman whom the butcher bluffed into taking\r\n\r\nit. All day long this heap of scraps was added to and taken away\r\n\r\nfrom, the dust and dirt of the street falling upon it, flies settling\r\n\r\non it, and the dirty fingers turning it over and over.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe costers wheel loads of specked and decaying fruit around in the\r\n\r\nbarrows all day, and very often store it in their one living and sleeping\r\n\r\nroom for the night. There it is exposed to the sickness and disease,\r\n\r\nthe effluvia and vile exhalations of overcrowded and rotten life, and\r\n\r\nnext day it is carted about again to be sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poor worker of the East End never knows what it is to eat good,\r\n\r\nwholesome meat or fruit\u2014in fact, he rarely eats meat or fruit\r\n\r\nat all; while the skilled workman has nothing to boast of in the way\r\n\r\nof what he eats. Judging from the coffee-houses, which is a fair\r\n\r\ncriterion, they never know in all their lives what tea, coffee, or cocoa\r\n\r\ntastes like. The slops and water-witcheries of the coffee-houses,\r\n\r\nvarying only in sloppiness and witchery, never even approximate or suggest\r\n\r\nwhat you and I are accustomed to drink as tea and coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little incident comes to me, connected with a coffee-house not\r\n\r\nfar from Jubilee Street on the Mile End Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cCawn yer let me \u2019ave somethin\u2019 for this, daughter?\r\n\r\nAnythin\u2019, Hi don\u2019t mind. Hi \u2019aven\u2019t \u2019ad\r\n\r\na bite the blessed dy, an\u2019 Hi\u2019m that fynt . . . \u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was an old woman, clad in decent black rags, and in her hand\r\n\r\nshe held a penny. The one she had addressed as \u201cdaughter\u201d\r\n\r\nwas a careworn woman of forty, proprietress and waitress of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nI waited, possibly as anxiously as the old woman, to see how the\r\n\r\nappeal would be received. It was four in the afternoon, and she\r\n\r\nlooked faint and sick. The woman hesitated an instant, then brought\r\n\r\na large plate of \u201cstewed lamb and young peas.\u201d I was\r\n\r\neating a plate of it myself, and it is my judgment that the lamb was\r\n\r\nmutton and that the peas might have been younger without being youthful.\r\n\r\nHowever, the point is, the dish was sold at sixpence, and the proprietress\r\n\r\ngave it for a penny, demonstrating anew the old truth that the poor\r\n\r\nare the most charitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old woman, profuse in her gratitude, took a seat on the other\r\n\r\nside of the narrow table and ravenously attacked the smoking stew.\r\n\r\nWe ate steadily and silently, the pair of us, when suddenly, explosively\r\n\r\nand most gleefully, she cried out to me,\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHi sold a box o\u2019 matches! Yus,\u201d she confirmed,\r\n\r\nif anything with greater and more explosive glee. \u201cHi sold\r\n\r\na box o\u2019 matches! That\u2019s \u2019ow Hi got the penny.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must be getting along in years,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cSeventy-four yesterday,\u201d she replied, and returned with\r\n\r\ngusto to her plate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBlimey, I\u2019d like to do something for the old girl, that\r\n\r\nI would, but this is the first I\u2019ve \u2019ad to-dy,\u201d the\r\n\r\nyoung fellow alongside volunteered to me. \u201cAn\u2019 I only\r\n\r\n\u2019ave this because I \u2019appened to make an odd shilling washin\u2019\r\n\r\nout, Lord lumme! I don\u2019t know \u2019ow many pots.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo work at my own tryde for six weeks,\u201d he said further,\r\n\r\nin reply to my questions; \u201cnothin\u2019 but odd jobs a blessed\r\n\r\nlong wy between.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nOne meets with all sorts of adventures in coffee-house, and I shall\r\n\r\nnot soon forget a Cockney Amazon in a place near Trafalgar Square, to\r\n\r\nwhom I tendered a sovereign when paying my score. (By the way,\r\n\r\none is supposed to pay before he begins to eat, and if he be poorly\r\n\r\ndressed he is compelled to pay before he eats).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girl bit the gold piece between her teeth, rang it on the counter,\r\n\r\nand then looked me and my rags witheringly up and down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you find it?\u201d she at length demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cSome mug left it on the table when he went out, eh, don\u2019t\r\n\r\nyou think?\u201d I retorted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWot\u2019s yer gyme?\u201d she queried, looking me calmly\r\n\r\nin the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI makes \u2019em,\u201d quoth I.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sniffed superciliously and gave me the change in small silver,\r\n\r\nand I had my revenge by biting and ringing every piece of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a ha\u2019penny for another lump of sugar\r\n\r\nin the tea,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in \u2019ell first,\u201d came the retort\r\n\r\ncourteous. Also, she amplified the retort courteous in divers\r\n\r\nvivid and unprintable ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nI never had much talent for repartee, but she knocked silly what\r\n\r\nlittle I had, and I gulped down my tea a beaten man, while she gloated\r\n\r\nafter me even as I passed out to the street.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile 300,000 people of London live in one-room tenements, and 900,000\r\n\r\nare illegally and viciously housed, 38,000 more are registered as living\r\n\r\nin common lodging-houses\u2014known in the vernacular as \u201cdoss-houses.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of doss-houses, but in one thing they are all alike,\r\n\r\nfrom the filthy little ones to the monster big ones paying five per\r\n\r\ncent. and blatantly lauded by smug middle-class men who know but one\r\n\r\nthing about them, and that one thing is their uninhabitableness.\r\n\r\nBy this I do not mean that the roofs leak or the walls are draughty;\r\n\r\nbut what I do mean is that life in them is degrading and unwholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe poor man\u2019s hotel,\u201d they are often called,\r\n\r\nbut the phrase is caricature. Not to possess a room to one\u2019s\r\n\r\nself, in which sometimes to sit alone; to be forced out of bed willy-nilly,\r\n\r\nthe first thing in the morning; to engage and pay anew for a bed each\r\n\r\nnight; and never to have any privacy, surely is a mode of existence\r\n\r\nquite different from that of hotel life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis must not be considered a sweeping condemnation of the big private\r\n\r\nand municipal lodging-houses and working-men\u2019s homes. Far\r\n\r\nfrom it. They have remedied many of the atrocities attendant upon\r\n\r\nthe irresponsible small doss-houses, and they give the workman more\r\n\r\nfor his money than he ever received before; but that does not make them\r\n\r\nas habitable or wholesome as the dwelling-place of a man should be who\r\n\r\ndoes his work in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little private doss-houses, as a rule, are unmitigated horrors.\r\n\r\nI have slept in them, and I know; but let me pass them by and confine\r\n\r\nmyself to the bigger and better ones. Not far from Middlesex Street,\r\n\r\nWhitechapel, I entered such a house, a place inhabited almost entirely\r\n\r\nby working men. The entrance was by way of a flight of steps descending\r\n\r\nfrom the sidewalk to what was properly the cellar of the building.\r\n\r\nHere were two large and gloomily lighted rooms, in which men cooked\r\n\r\nand ate. I had intended to do some cooking myself, but the smell\r\n\r\nof the place stole away my appetite, or, rather, wrested it from me;\r\n\r\nso I contented myself with watching other men cook and eat.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne workman, home from work, sat down opposite me at the rough wooden\r\n\r\ntable, and began his meal. A handful of salt on the not over-clean\r\n\r\ntable constituted his butter. Into it he dipped his bread, mouthful\r\n\r\nby mouthful, and washed it down with tea from a big mug. A piece\r\n\r\nof fish completed his bill of fare. He ate silently, looking neither\r\n\r\nto right nor left nor across at me. Here and there, at the various\r\n\r\ntables, other men were eating, just as silently. In the whole\r\n\r\nroom there was hardly a note of conversation. A feeling of gloom\r\n\r\npervaded the ill-lighted place. Many of them sat and brooded over\r\n\r\nthe crumbs of their repast, and made me wonder, as Childe Roland wondered,\r\n\r\nwhat evil they had done that they should be punished so.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the kitchen came the sounds of more genial life, and I ventured\r\n\r\ninto the range where the men were cooking. But the smell I had\r\n\r\nnoticed on entering was stronger here, and a rising nausea drove me\r\n\r\ninto the street for fresh air.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my return I paid fivepence for a \u201ccabin,\u201d took my\r\n\r\nreceipt for the same in the form of a huge brass check, and went upstairs\r\n\r\nto the smoking-room. Here, a couple of small billiard tables and\r\n\r\nseveral checkerboards were being used by young working-men, who waited\r\n\r\nin relays for their turn at the games, while many men were sitting around,\r\n\r\nsmoking, reading, and mending their clothes. The young men were\r\n\r\nhilarious, the old men were gloomy. In fact, there were two types\r\n\r\nof men, the cheerful and the sodden or blue, and age seemed to determine\r\n\r\nthe classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut no more than the two cellar rooms did this room convey the remotest\r\n\r\nsuggestion of home. Certainly there could be nothing home-like\r\n\r\nabout it to you and me, who know what home really is. On the walls\r\n\r\nwere the most preposterous and insulting notices regulating the conduct\r\n\r\nof the guests, and at ten o\u2019clock the lights were put out, and\r\n\r\nnothing remained but bed. This was gained by descending again\r\n\r\nto the cellar, by surrendering the brass check to a burly doorkeeper,\r\n\r\nand by climbing a long flight of stairs into the upper regions.\r\n\r\nI went to the top of the building and down again, passing several floors\r\n\r\nfilled with sleeping men. The \u201ccabins\u201d were the best\r\n\r\naccommodation, each cabin allowing space for a tiny bed and room alongside\r\n\r\nof it in which to undress. The bedding was clean, and with neither\r\n\r\nit nor the bed do I find any fault. But there was no privacy about\r\n\r\nit, no being alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get an adequate idea of a floor filled with cabins, you have merely\r\n\r\nto magnify a layer of the pasteboard pigeon-holes of an egg-crate till\r\n\r\neach pigeon-hole is seven feet in height and otherwise properly dimensioned,\r\n\r\nthen place the magnified layer on the floor of a large, barnlike room,\r\n\r\nand there you have it. There are no ceilings to the pigeon-holes,\r\n\r\nthe walls are thin, and the snores from all the sleepers and every move\r\n\r\nand turn of your nearer neighbours come plainly to your ears.\r\n\r\nAnd this cabin is yours only for a little while. In the morning\r\n\r\nout you go. You cannot put your trunk in it, or come and go when\r\n\r\nyou like, or lock the door behind you, or anything of the sort.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is no door at all, only a doorway. If you care\r\n\r\nto remain a guest in this poor man\u2019s hotel, you must put up with\r\n\r\nall this, and with prison regulations which impress upon you constantly\r\n\r\nthat you are nobody, with little soul of your own and less to say about\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I contend that the least a man who does his day\u2019s work\r\n\r\nshould have is a room to himself, where he can lock the door and be\r\n\r\nsafe in his possessions; where he can sit down and read by a window\r\n\r\nor look out; where he can come and go whenever he wishes; where he can\r\n\r\naccumulate a few personal belongings other than those he carries about\r\n\r\nwith him on his back and in his pockets; where he can hang up pictures\r\n\r\nof his mother, sister, sweet-heart, ballet dancers, or bulldogs, as\r\n\r\nhis heart listeth\u2014in short, one place of his own on the earth\r\n\r\nof which he can say: \u201cThis is mine, my castle; the world stops\r\n\r\nat the threshold; here am I lord and master.\u201d He will be\r\n\r\na better citizen, this man; and he will do a better day\u2019s work.\r\n\r\n\r\nI stood on one floor of the poor man\u2019s hotel and listened.\r\n\r\nI went from bed to bed and looked at the sleepers. They were young\r\n\r\nmen, from twenty to forty, most of them. Old men cannot afford\r\n\r\nthe working-man\u2019s home. They go to the workhouse.\r\n\r\nBut I looked at the young men, scores of them, and they were not bad-looking\r\n\r\nfellows. Their faces were made for women\u2019s kisses, their\r\n\r\nnecks for women\u2019s arms. They were lovable, as men are lovable.\r\n\r\nThey were capable of love. A woman\u2019s touch redeems and softens,\r\n\r\nand they needed such redemption and softening instead of each day growing\r\n\r\nharsh and harsher. And I wondered where these women were, and\r\n\r\nheard a \u201charlot\u2019s ginny laugh.\u201d Leman Street,\r\n\r\nWaterloo Road, Piccadilly, The Strand, answered me, and I knew where\r\n\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE PRECARIOUSNESS OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nI was talking with a very vindictive man. In his opinion, his\r\n\r\nwife had wronged him and the law had wronged him. The merits and\r\n\r\nmorals of the case are immaterial. The meat of the matter is that\r\n\r\nshe had obtained a separation, and he was compelled to pay ten shillings\r\n\r\neach week for the support of her and the five children. \u201cBut\r\n\r\nlook you,\u201d said he to me, \u201cwot\u2019ll \u2019appen to\r\n\r\n\u2019er if I don\u2019t py up the ten shillings? S\u2019posin\u2019,\r\n\r\nnow, just s\u2019posin\u2019 a accident \u2019appens to me, so I\r\n\r\ncawn\u2019t work. S\u2019posin\u2019 I get a rupture, or the\r\n\r\nrheumatics, or the cholera. Wot\u2019s she goin\u2019 to do,\r\n\r\neh? Wot\u2019s she goin\u2019 to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe shook his head sadly. \u201cNo \u2019ope for \u2019er.\r\n\r\nThe best she cawn do is the work\u2019ouse, an\u2019 that\u2019s\r\n\r\n\u2019ell. An\u2019 if she don\u2019t go to the work\u2019ouse,\r\n\r\nit\u2019ll be a worse \u2019ell. Come along \u2019ith me an\u2019\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll show you women sleepin\u2019 in a passage, a dozen of \u2019em.\r\n\r\nAn\u2019 I\u2019ll show you worse, wot she\u2019ll come to if anythin\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2019appens to me and the ten shillings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe certitude of this man\u2019s forecast is worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nHe knew conditions sufficiently to know the precariousness of his wife\u2019s\r\n\r\ngrasp on food and shelter. For her game was up when his working\r\n\r\ncapacity was impaired or destroyed. And when this state of affairs\r\n\r\nis looked at in its larger aspect, the same will be found true of hundreds\r\n\r\nof thousands and even millions of men and women living amicably together\r\n\r\nand co-operating in the pursuit of food and shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figures are appalling: 1,800,000 people in London live on the\r\n\r\npoverty line and below it, and 1,000,000 live with one week\u2019s\r\n\r\nwages between them and pauperism. In all England and Wales, eighteen\r\n\r\nper cent. of the whole population are driven to the parish for relief,\r\n\r\nand in London, according to the statistics of the London County Council,\r\n\r\ntwenty-one per cent. of the whole population are driven to the parish\r\n\r\nfor relief. Between being driven to the parish for relief and\r\n\r\nbeing an out-and-out pauper there is a great difference, yet London\r\n\r\nsupports 123,000 paupers, quite a city of folk in themselves.\r\n\r\nOne in every four in London dies on public charity, while 939 out of\r\n\r\nevery 1000 in the United Kingdom die in poverty; 8,000,000 simply struggle\r\n\r\non the ragged edge of starvation, and 20,000,000 more are not comfortable\r\n\r\nin the simple and clean sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to go more into detail concerning the London people\r\n\r\nwho die on charity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1886, and up to 1893, the percentage of pauperism to population\r\n\r\nwas less in London than in all England; but since 1893, and for every\r\n\r\nsucceeding year, the percentage of pauperism to population has been\r\n\r\ngreater in London than in all England. Yet, from the Registrar-General\u2019s\r\n\r\nReport for 1886, the following figures are taken:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of 81,951 deaths in London (1884):\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nIn workhouses\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09,909\r\n\r\nIn hospitals\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06,559\r\n\r\nIn lunatic asylums\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0278\r\n\r\nTotal in public refuges\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a016,746\r\n\r\n\r\nCommenting on these figures, a Fabian writer says: \u201cConsidering\r\n\r\nthat comparatively few of these are children, it is probable that one\r\n\r\nin every three London adults will be driven into one of these refuges\r\n\r\nto die, and the proportion in the case of the manual labour class must\r\n\r\nof course be still larger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures serve somewhat to indicate the proximity of the average\r\n\r\nworker to pauperism. Various things make pauperism. An advertisement,\r\n\r\nfor instance, such as this, appearing in yesterday morning\u2019s paper:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cClerk wanted, with knowledge of shorthand, typewriting, and\r\n\r\ninvoicing: wages ten shillings ($2.50) a week. Apply by letter,\u201d\r\n\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in to-day\u2019s paper I read of a clerk, thirty-five years\r\n\r\nof age and an inmate of a London workhouse, brought before a magistrate\r\n\r\nfor non-performance of task. He claimed that he had done his various\r\n\r\ntasks since he had been an inmate; but when the master set him to breaking\r\n\r\nstones, his hands blistered, and he could not finish the task.\r\n\r\nHe had never been used to an implement heavier than a pen, he said.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate sentenced him and his blistered hands to seven days\u2019\r\n\r\nhard labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld age, of course, makes pauperism. And then there is the\r\n\r\naccident, the thing happening, the death or disablement of the husband,\r\n\r\nfather, and bread-winner. Here is a man, with a wife and three\r\n\r\nchildren, living on the ticklish security of twenty shillings per week\u2014and\r\n\r\nthere are hundreds of thousands of such families in London. Perforce,\r\n\r\nto even half exist, they must live up to the last penny of it, so that\r\n\r\na week\u2019s wages (one pound) is all that stands between this family\r\n\r\nand pauperism or starvation. The thing happens, the father is\r\n\r\nstruck down, and what then? A mother with three children can do\r\n\r\nlittle or nothing. Either she must hand her children over to society\r\n\r\nas juvenile paupers, in order to be free to do something adequate for\r\n\r\nherself, or she must go to the sweat-shops for work which she can perform\r\n\r\nin the vile den possible to her reduced income. But with the sweat-shops,\r\n\r\nmarried women who eke out their husband\u2019s earnings, and single\r\n\r\nwomen who have but themselves miserably to support, determine the scale\r\n\r\nof wages. And this scale of wages, so determined, is so low that\r\n\r\nthe mother and her three children can live only in positive beastliness\r\n\r\nand semi-starvation, till decay and death end their suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo show that this mother, with her three children to support, cannot\r\n\r\ncompete in the sweating industries, I instance from the current newspapers\r\n\r\nthe two following cases:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nA father indignantly writes that his daughter and a girl companion\r\n\r\nreceive 8.5d. per gross for making boxes. They made each day four\r\n\r\ngross. Their expenses were 8d. for car fare, 2d. for stamps, 2.5d.\r\n\r\nfor glue, and 1d. for string, so that all they earned between them was\r\n\r\n1s. 9d., or a daily wage each of 10.5d.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second case, before the Luton Guardians a few days ago, an old woman of\r\n\r\nseventy-two appeared, asking for relief. \u201cShe was a straw-hat maker, but\r\n\r\nhad been compelled to give up the work owing to the price she obtained for\r\n\r\nthem\u2014namely, 2.25d. each. For that price she had to provide plait\r\n\r\ntrimmings and make and finish the hats.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nYet this mother and her three children we are considering have done\r\n\r\nno wrong that they should be so punished. They have not sinned.\r\n\r\nThe thing happened, that is all; the husband, father and bread-winner,\r\n\r\nwas struck down. There is no guarding against it. It is\r\n\r\nfortuitous. A family stands so many chances of escaping the bottom\r\n\r\nof the Abyss, and so many chances of falling plump down to it.\r\n\r\nThe chance is reducible to cold, pitiless figures, and a few of these\r\n\r\nfigures will not be out of place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir A. Forwood calculates that\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n1 of every 1400 workmen is killed annually.\r\n\r\n1 of every 2500 workmen is totally disabled.\r\n\r\n1 of every 300 workmen is permanently partially disabled.\r\n\r\n1 of every 8 workmen is temporarily disabled 3 or 4 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut these are only the accidents of industry. The high mortality\r\n\r\nof the people who live in the Ghetto plays a terrible part. The\r\n\r\naverage age at death among the people of the West End is fifty-five\r\n\r\nyears; the average age at death among the people of the East End is\r\n\r\nthirty years. That is to say, the person in the West End has twice\r\n\r\nthe chance for life that the person has in the East End. Talk\r\n\r\nof war! The mortality in South Africa and the Philippines fades\r\n\r\naway to insignificance. Here, in the heart of peace, is where\r\n\r\nthe blood is being shed; and here not even the civilised rules of warfare\r\n\r\nobtain, for the women and children and babes in the arms are killed\r\n\r\njust as ferociously as the men are killed. War! In England,\r\n\r\nevery year, 500,000 men, women, and children, engaged in the various\r\n\r\nindustries, are killed and disabled, or are injured to disablement by\r\n\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the West End eighteen per cent. of the children die before five\r\n\r\nyears of age; in the East End fifty-five per cent. of the children die\r\n\r\nbefore five years of age. And there are streets in London where\r\n\r\nout of every one hundred children born in a year, fifty die during the\r\n\r\nnext year; and of the fifty that remain, twenty-five die before they\r\n\r\nare five years old. Slaughter! Herod did not do quite so\r\n\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat industry causes greater havoc with human life than battle does\r\n\r\nno better substantiation can be given than the following extract from\r\n\r\na recent report of the Liverpool Medical Officer, which is not applicable\r\n\r\nto Liverpool alone:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many instances little if any sunlight could get to the courts, and the\r\n\r\natmosphere within the dwellings was always foul, owing largely to the saturated\r\n\r\ncondition of the walls and ceilings, which for so many years had absorbed the\r\n\r\nexhalations of the occupants into their porous material. Singular testimony to\r\n\r\nthe absence of sunlight in these courts was furnished by the action of the\r\n\r\nParks and Gardens Committee, who desired to brighten the homes of the poorest\r\n\r\nclass by gifts of growing flowers and window-boxes; but these gifts could not\r\n\r\nbe made in courts such as these, as flowers and plants were susceptible to\r\n\r\nthe unwholesome surroundings, and would not live.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. George Haw has compiled the following table on the three St. George\u2019s\r\n\r\nparishes (London parishes):\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nPercentage ofPopulationOvercrowdedDeath-rateper 1000\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. George\u2019s West1013.2\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. George\u2019s South3523.7\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. George\u2019s East4026.4\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there are the \u201cdangerous trades,\u201d in which countless workers\r\n\r\nare employed. Their hold on life is indeed precarious\u2014far, far more\r\n\r\nprecarious than the hold of the twentieth-century soldier on life. In the linen\r\n\r\ntrade, in the preparation of the flax, wet feet and wet clothes cause an\r\n\r\nunusual amount of bronchitis, pneumonia, and severe rheumatism; while in the\r\n\r\ncarding and spinning departments the fine dust produces lung disease in the\r\n\r\nmajority of cases, and the woman who starts carding at seventeen or eighteen\r\n\r\nbegins to break up and go to pieces at thirty. The chemical labourers, picked\r\n\r\nfrom the strongest and most splendidly-built men to be found, live, on an\r\n\r\naverage, less than forty-eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSays Dr. Arlidge, of the potter\u2019s trade: \u201cPotter\u2019s\r\n\r\ndust does not kill suddenly, but settles, year after year, a little\r\n\r\nmore firmly into the lungs, until at length a case of plaster is formed.\r\n\r\nBreathing becomes more and more difficult and depressed, and finally\r\n\r\nceases.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nSteel dust, stone dust, clay dust, alkali dust, fluff dust, fibre\r\n\r\ndust\u2014all these things kill, and they are more deadly than machine-guns\r\n\r\nand pom-poms. Worst of all is the lead dust in the white-lead\r\n\r\ntrades. Here is a description of the typical dissolution of a\r\n\r\nyoung, healthy, well-developed girl who goes to work in a white-lead\r\n\r\nfactory:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, after a varying degree of exposure, she becomes an\u00e6mic. It may be that\r\n\r\nher gums show a very faint blue line, or perchance her teeth and gums are\r\n\r\nperfectly sound, and no blue line is discernible. Coincidently with the anaemia\r\n\r\nshe has been getting thinner, but so gradually as scarcely to impress itself\r\n\r\nupon her or her friends. Sickness, however, ensues, and headaches, growing in\r\n\r\nintensity, are developed. These are frequently attended by obscuration of\r\n\r\nvision or temporary blindness. Such a girl passes into what appears to her\r\n\r\nfriends and medical adviser as ordinary hysteria. This gradually deepens\r\n\r\nwithout warning, until she is suddenly seized with a convulsion, beginning in\r\n\r\none half of the face, then involving the arm, next the leg of the same side of\r\n\r\nthe body, until the convulsion, violent and purely epileptic form in character,\r\n\r\nbecomes universal. This is attended by loss of consciousness, out of which she\r\n\r\npasses into a series of convulsions, gradually increasing in severity, in one\r\n\r\nof which she dies\u2014or consciousness, partial or perfect, is regained,\r\n\r\neither, it may be, for a few minutes, a few hours, or days, during which\r\n\r\nviolent headache is complained of, or she is delirious and excited, as in acute\r\n\r\nmania, or dull and sullen as in melancholia, and requires to be roused, when\r\n\r\nshe is found wandering, and her speech is somewhat imperfect. Without further\r\n\r\nwarning, save that the pulse, which has become soft, with nearly the normal\r\n\r\nnumber of beats, all at once becomes low and hard; she is suddenly seized with\r\n\r\nanother convulsion, in which she dies, or passes into a state of coma from\r\n\r\nwhich she never rallies. In another case the convulsions will gradually\r\n\r\nsubside, the headache disappears and the patient recovers, only to find that\r\n\r\nshe has completely lost her eyesight, a loss that may be temporary or\r\n\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here are a few specific cases of white-lead poisoning:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nCharlotte Rafferty, a fine, well-grown young woman with\r\n\r\na splendid constitution\u2014who had never had a day\u2019s illness\r\n\r\nin her life\u2014became a white-lead worker. Convulsions seized\r\n\r\nher at the foot of the ladder in the works. Dr. Oliver examined\r\n\r\nher, found the blue line along her gums, which shows that the system\r\n\r\nis under the influence of the lead. He knew that the convulsions\r\n\r\nwould shortly return. They did so, and she died.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Ann Toler\u2014a girl of seventeen, who had never had a fit\r\n\r\nin her life\u2014three times became ill, and had to leave off work\r\n\r\nin the factory. Before she was nineteen she showed symptoms of\r\n\r\nlead poisoning\u2014had fits, frothed at the mouth, and died.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary A., an unusually vigorous woman, was able to work in the lead\r\n\r\nfactory for twenty years, having colic once only during that\r\n\r\ntime. Her eight children all died in early infancy from convulsions.\r\n\r\nOne morning, whilst brushing her hair, this woman suddenly lost all\r\n\r\npower in both her wrists.\r\n\r\n\r\nEliza H., aged twenty-five, after five months at lead works,\r\n\r\nwas seized with colic. She entered another factory (after being\r\n\r\nrefused by the first one) and worked on uninterruptedly for two years.\r\n\r\nThen the former symptoms returned, she was seized with convulsions,\r\n\r\nand died in two days of acute lead poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Vaughan Nash, speaking of the unborn generation, says: \u201cThe\r\n\r\nchildren of the white-lead worker enter the world, as a rule, only to\r\n\r\ndie from the convulsions of lead poisoning\u2014they are either born\r\n\r\nprematurely, or die within the first year.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, let me instance the case of Harriet A. Walker, a young\r\n\r\ngirl of seventeen, killed while leading a forlorn hope on the industrial\r\n\r\nbattlefield. She was employed as an enamelled ware brusher, wherein\r\n\r\nlead poisoning is encountered. Her father and brother were both\r\n\r\nout of employment. She concealed her illness, walked six miles\r\n\r\na day to and from work, earned her seven or eight shillings per week,\r\n\r\nand died, at seventeen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression in trade also plays an important part in hurling the workers\r\n\r\ninto the Abyss. With a week\u2019s wages between a family and\r\n\r\npauperism, a month\u2019s enforced idleness means hardship and misery\r\n\r\nalmost indescribable, and from the ravages of which the victims do not\r\n\r\nalways recover when work is to be had again. Just now the daily\r\n\r\npapers contain the report of a meeting of the Carlisle branch of the\r\n\r\nDockers\u2019 Union, wherein it is stated that many of the men, for\r\n\r\nmonths past, have not averaged a weekly income of more than from four\r\n\r\nto five shillings. The stagnated state of the shipping industry\r\n\r\nin the port of London is held accountable for this condition of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the young working-man or working-woman, or married couple, there\r\n\r\nis no assurance of happy or healthy middle life, nor of solvent old\r\n\r\nage. Work as they will, they cannot make their future secure.\r\n\r\nIt is all a matter of chance. Everything depends upon the thing\r\n\r\nhappening, the thing with which they have nothing to do. Precaution\r\n\r\ncannot fend it off, nor can wiles evade it. If they remain on\r\n\r\nthe industrial battlefield they must face it and take their chance against\r\n\r\nheavy odds. Of course, if they are favourably made and are not\r\n\r\ntied by kinship duties, they may run away from the industrial battlefield.\r\n\r\nIn which event the safest thing the man can do is to join the army;\r\n\r\nand for the woman, possibly, to become a Red Cross nurse or go into\r\n\r\na nunnery. In either case they must forego home and children and\r\n\r\nall that makes life worth living and old age other than a nightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSUICIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith life so precarious, and opportunity for the happiness of life\r\n\r\nso remote, it is inevitable that life shall be cheap and suicide common.\r\n\r\nSo common is it, that one cannot pick up a daily paper without running\r\n\r\nacross it; while an attempt-at-suicide case in a police court excites\r\n\r\nno more interest than an ordinary \u201cdrunk,\u201d and is handled\r\n\r\nwith the same rapidity and unconcern.\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember such a case in the Thames Police Court. I pride\r\n\r\nmyself that I have good eyes and ears, and a fair working knowledge\r\n\r\nof men and things; but I confess, as I stood in that court-room, that\r\n\r\nI was half bewildered by the amazing despatch with which drunks, disorderlies,\r\n\r\nvagrants, brawlers, wife-beaters, thieves, fences, gamblers, and women\r\n\r\nof the street went through the machine of justice. The dock stood\r\n\r\nin the centre of the court (where the light is best), and into it and\r\n\r\nout again stepped men, women, and children, in a stream as steady as\r\n\r\nthe stream of sentences which fell from the magistrate\u2019s lips.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was still pondering over a consumptive \u201cfence\u201d who\r\n\r\nhad pleaded inability to work and necessity for supporting wife and\r\n\r\nchildren, and who had received a year at hard labour, when a young boy\r\n\r\nof about twenty appeared in the dock. \u201cAlfred Freeman,\u201d\r\n\r\nI caught his name, but failed to catch the charge. A stout and\r\n\r\nmotherly-looking woman bobbed up in the witness-box and began her testimony.\r\n\r\nWife of the Britannia lock-keeper, I learned she was. Time, night;\r\n\r\na splash; she ran to the lock and found the prisoner in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nI flashed my gaze from her to him. So that was the charge,\r\n\r\nself-murder. He stood there dazed and unheeding, his bonny brown\r\n\r\nhair rumpled down his forehead, his face haggard and careworn and boyish\r\n\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the lock-keeper\u2019s wife was saying.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs fast as I pulled to get \u2019im out, \u2019e crawled back.\r\n\r\nThen I called for \u2019elp, and some workmen \u2019appened along,\r\n\r\nand we got \u2019im out and turned \u2019im over to the constable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magistrate complimented the woman on her muscular powers, and\r\n\r\nthe court-room laughed; but all I could see was a boy on the threshold\r\n\r\nof life, passionately crawling to muddy death, and there was no laughter\r\n\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man was now in the witness-box, testifying to the boy\u2019s good\r\n\r\ncharacter and giving extenuating evidence. He was the boy\u2019s\r\n\r\nforeman, or had been. Alfred was a good boy, but he had had lots\r\n\r\nof trouble at home, money matters. And then his mother was sick.\r\n\r\nHe was given to worrying, and he worried over it till he laid himself\r\n\r\nout and wasn\u2019t fit for work. He (the foreman), for the sake\r\n\r\nof his own reputation, the boy\u2019s work being bad, had been forced\r\n\r\nto ask him to resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything to say?\u201d the magistrate demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy in the dock mumbled something indistinctly. He was\r\n\r\nstill dazed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does he say, constable?\u201d the magistrate asked impatiently.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stalwart man in blue bent his ear to the prisoner\u2019s lips,\r\n\r\nand then replied loudly, \u201cHe says he\u2019s very sorry, your\r\n\r\nWorship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cRemanded,\u201d said his Worship; and the next case was under\r\n\r\nway, the first witness already engaged in taking the oath. The\r\n\r\nboy, dazed and unheeding, passed out with the jailer. That was\r\n\r\nall, five minutes from start to finish; and two hulking brutes in the\r\n\r\ndock were trying strenuously to shift the responsibility of the possession\r\n\r\nof a stolen fishing-pole, worth probably ten cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble with these poor folk is that they do not know how\r\n\r\nto commit suicide, and usually have to make two or three attempts before\r\n\r\nthey succeed. This, very naturally, is a horrid nuisance to the\r\n\r\nconstables and magistrates, and gives them no end of trouble.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the magistrates are frankly outspoken about the\r\n\r\nmatter, and censure the prisoners for the slackness of their attempts.\r\n\r\nFor instance Mr. R. S---, chairman of the S--- B--- magistrates, in\r\n\r\nthe case the other day of Ann Wood, who tried to make away with herself\r\n\r\nin the canal: \u201cIf you wanted to do it, why didn\u2019t you do\r\n\r\nit and get it done with?\u201d demanded the indignant Mr. R. S---.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you not get under the water and make an end of it, instead\r\n\r\nof giving us all this trouble and bother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nPoverty, misery, and fear of the workhouse, are the principal causes\r\n\r\nof suicide among the working classes. \u201cI\u2019ll drown\r\n\r\nmyself before I go into the workhouse,\u201d said Ellen Hughes Hunt,\r\n\r\naged fifty-two. Last Wednesday they held an inquest on her body\r\n\r\nat Shoreditch. Her husband came from the Islington Workhouse to\r\n\r\ntestify. He had been a cheesemonger, but failure in business and\r\n\r\npoverty had driven him into the workhouse, whither his wife had refused\r\n\r\nto accompany him.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was last seen at one in the morning. Three hours later\r\n\r\nher hat and jacket were found on the towing path by the Regent\u2019s\r\n\r\nCanal, and later her body was fished from the water. Verdict:\r\n\r\nSuicide during temporary insanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch verdicts are crimes against truth. The Law is a lie, and\r\n\r\nthrough it men lie most shamelessly. For instance, a disgraced\r\n\r\nwoman, forsaken and spat upon by kith and kin, doses herself and her\r\n\r\nbaby with laudanum. The baby dies; but she pulls through after\r\n\r\na few weeks in hospital, is charged with murder, convicted, and sentenced\r\n\r\nto ten years\u2019 penal servitude. Recovering, the Law holds\r\n\r\nher responsible for her actions; yet, had she died, the same Law would\r\n\r\nhave rendered a verdict of temporary insanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, considering the case of Ellen Hughes Hunt, it is as fair and\r\n\r\nlogical to say that her husband was suffering from temporary insanity\r\n\r\nwhen he went into the Islington Workhouse, as it is to say that she\r\n\r\nwas suffering from temporary insanity when she went into the Regent\u2019s\r\n\r\nCanal. As to which is the preferable sojourning place is a matter\r\n\r\nof opinion, of intellectual judgment. I, for one, from what I\r\n\r\nknow of canals and workhouses, should choose the canal, were I in a\r\n\r\nsimilar position. And I make bold to contend that I am no more\r\n\r\ninsane than Ellen Hughes Hunt, her husband, and the rest of the human\r\n\r\nherd.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan no longer follows instinct with the old natural fidelity.\r\n\r\nHe has developed into a reasoning creature, and can intellectually cling\r\n\r\nto life or discard life just as life happens to promise great pleasure\r\n\r\nor pain. I dare to assert that Ellen Hughes Hunt, defrauded and\r\n\r\nbilked of all the joys of life which fifty-two years\u2019 service\r\n\r\nin the world has earned, with nothing but the horrors of the workhouse\r\n\r\nbefore her, was very rational and level-headed when she elected to jump\r\n\r\ninto the canal. And I dare to assert, further, that the jury had\r\n\r\ndone a wiser thing to bring in a verdict charging society with temporary\r\n\r\ninsanity for allowing Ellen Hughes Hunt to be defrauded and bilked of\r\n\r\nall the joys of life which fifty-two years\u2019 service in the world\r\n\r\nhad earned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemporary insanity! Oh, these cursed phrases, these lies of\r\n\r\nlanguage, under which people with meat in their bellies and whole shirts\r\n\r\non their backs shelter themselves, and evade the responsibility of their\r\n\r\nbrothers and sisters, empty of belly and without whole shirts on their\r\n\r\nbacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom one issue of the Observer, an East End paper, I quote the following\r\n\r\ncommonplace events:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nA ship\u2019s fireman, named Johnny King, was charged\r\n\r\nwith attempting to commit suicide. On Wednesday defendant went\r\n\r\nto Bow Police Station and stated that he had swallowed a quantity of\r\n\r\nphosphor paste, as he was hard up and unable to obtain work. King\r\n\r\nwas taken inside and an emetic administered, when he vomited up a quantity\r\n\r\nof the poison. Defendant now said he was very sorry. Although\r\n\r\nhe had sixteen years\u2019 good character, he was unable to obtain\r\n\r\nwork of any kind. Mr. Dickinson had defendant put back for the\r\n\r\ncourt missionary to see him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTimothy Warner, thirty-two, was remanded for a similar offence.\r\n\r\nHe jumped off Limehouse Pier, and when rescued, said, \u201cI intended\r\n\r\nto do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA decent-looking young woman, named Ellen Gray, was remanded on a\r\n\r\ncharge of attempting to commit suicide. About half-past eight\r\n\r\non Sunday morning Constable 834 K found defendant lying in a doorway\r\n\r\nin Benworth Street, and she was in a very drowsy condition. She\r\n\r\nwas holding an empty bottle in one hand, and stated that some two or\r\n\r\nthree hours previously she had swallowed a quantity of laudanum.\r\n\r\nAs she was evidently very ill, the divisional surgeon was sent for,\r\n\r\nand having administered some coffee, ordered that she was to be kept\r\n\r\nawake. When defendant was charged, she stated that the reason\r\n\r\nwhy she attempted to take her life was she had neither home nor friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not say that all people who commit suicide are sane, no more\r\n\r\nthan I say that all people who do not commit suicide are sane.\r\n\r\nInsecurity of food and shelter, by the way, is a great cause of insanity\r\n\r\namong the living. Costermongers, hawkers, and pedlars, a class\r\n\r\nof workers who live from hand to mouth more than those of any other\r\n\r\nclass, form the highest percentage of those in the lunatic asylums.\r\n\r\nAmong the males each year, 26.9 per 10,000 go insane, and among the\r\n\r\nwomen, 36.9. On the other hand, of soldiers, who are at least\r\n\r\nsure of food and shelter, 13 per 10,000 go insane; and of farmers and\r\n\r\ngraziers, only 5.1. So a coster is twice as likely to lose his\r\n\r\nreason as a soldier, and five times as likely as a farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMisfortune and misery are very potent in turning people\u2019s heads,\r\n\r\nand drive one person to the lunatic asylum, and another to the morgue\r\n\r\nor the gallows. When the thing happens, and the father and husband,\r\n\r\nfor all of his love for wife and children and his willingness to work,\r\n\r\ncan get no work to do, it is a simple matter for his reason to totter\r\n\r\nand the light within his brain go out. And it is especially simple\r\n\r\nwhen it is taken into consideration that his body is ravaged by innutrition\r\n\r\nand disease, in addition to his soul being torn by the sight of his\r\n\r\nsuffering wife and little ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a good-looking man, with a mass of black hair, dark,\r\n\r\nexpressive eyes, delicately chiselled nose and chin, and wavy, fair\r\n\r\nmoustache.\u201d This is the reporter\u2019s description of\r\n\r\nFrank Cavilla as he stood in court, this dreary month of September,\r\n\r\n\u201cdressed in a much worn grey suit, and wearing no collar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Cavilla lived and worked as a house decorator in London.\r\n\r\nHe is described as a good workman, a steady fellow, and not given to\r\n\r\ndrink, while all his neighbours unite in testifying that he was a gentle\r\n\r\nand affectionate husband and father.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis wife, Hannah Cavilla, was a big, handsome, light-hearted woman.\r\n\r\nShe saw to it that his children were sent neat and clean (the neighbours\r\n\r\nall remarked the fact) to the Childeric Road Board School. And\r\n\r\nso, with such a man, so blessed, working steadily and living temperately,\r\n\r\nall went well, and the goose hung high.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the thing happened. He worked for a Mr. Beck, builder,\r\n\r\nand lived in one of his master\u2019s houses in Trundley Road.\r\n\r\nMr. Beck was thrown from his trap and killed. The thing was an\r\n\r\nunruly horse, and, as I say, it happened. Cavilla had to seek\r\n\r\nfresh employment and find another house.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis occurred eighteen months ago. For eighteen months he fought\r\n\r\nthe big fight. He got rooms in a little house in Batavia Road,\r\n\r\nbut could not make both ends meet. Steady work could not be obtained.\r\n\r\nHe struggled manfully at casual employment of all sorts, his wife and\r\n\r\nfour children starving before his eyes. He starved himself, and\r\n\r\ngrew weak, and fell ill. This was three months ago, and then there\r\n\r\nwas absolutely no food at all. They made no complaint, spoke no\r\n\r\nword; but poor folk know. The housewives of Batavia Road sent\r\n\r\nthem food, but so respectable were the Cavillas that the food was sent\r\n\r\nanonymously, mysteriously, so as not to hurt their pride.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing had happened. He had fought, and starved, and suffered\r\n\r\nfor eighteen months. He got up one September morning, early.\r\n\r\nHe opened his pocket-knife. He cut the throat of his wife, Hannah\r\n\r\nCavilla, aged thirty-three. He cut the throat of his first-born,\r\n\r\nFrank, aged twelve. He cut the throat of his son, Walter, aged\r\n\r\neight. He cut the throat of his daughter, Nellie, aged four.\r\n\r\nHe cut the throat of his youngest-born, Ernest, aged sixteen months.\r\n\r\nThen he watched beside the dead all day until the evening, when the\r\n\r\npolice came, and he told them to put a penny in the slot of the gas-meter\r\n\r\nin order that they might have light to see.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Cavilla stood in court, dressed in a much worn grey suit, and\r\n\r\nwearing no collar. He was a good-looking man, with a mass of black\r\n\r\nhair, dark, expressive eyes, delicately chiselled nose and chin, and\r\n\r\nwavy, fair moustache.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere home is a hovel, and dull we grovel,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting the world is fair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one beautiful sight in the East End, and only one, and it\r\n\r\nis the children dancing in the street when the organ-grinder goes his\r\n\r\nround. It is fascinating to watch them, the new-born, the next\r\n\r\ngeneration, swaying and stepping, with pretty little mimicries and graceful\r\n\r\ninventions all their own, with muscles that move swiftly and easily,\r\n\r\nand bodies that leap airily, weaving rhythms never taught in dancing\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have talked with these children, here, there, and everywhere, and\r\n\r\nthey struck me as being bright as other children, and in many ways even\r\n\r\nbrighter. They have most active little imaginations. Their\r\n\r\ncapacity for projecting themselves into the realm of romance and fantasy\r\n\r\nis remarkable. A joyous life is romping in their blood.\r\n\r\nThey delight in music, and motion, and colour, and very often they betray\r\n\r\na startling beauty of face and form under their filth and rags.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there is a Pied Piper of London Town who steals them all away.\r\n\r\nThey disappear. One never sees them again, or anything that suggests\r\n\r\nthem. You may look for them in vain amongst the generation of\r\n\r\ngrown-ups. Here you will find stunted forms, ugly faces, and blunt\r\n\r\nand stolid minds. Grace, beauty, imagination, all the resiliency\r\n\r\nof mind and muscle, are gone. Sometimes, however, you may see\r\n\r\na woman, not necessarily old, but twisted and deformed out of all womanhood,\r\n\r\nbloated and drunken, lift her draggled skirts and execute a few grotesque\r\n\r\nand lumbering steps upon the pavement. It is a hint that she was\r\n\r\nonce one of those children who danced to the organ-grinder. Those\r\n\r\ngrotesque and lumbering steps are all that is left of the promise of\r\n\r\nchildhood. In the befogged recesses of her brain has arisen a\r\n\r\nfleeting memory that she was once a girl. The crowd closes in.\r\n\r\nLittle girls are dancing beside her, about her, with all the pretty\r\n\r\ngraces she dimly recollects, but can no more than parody with her body.\r\n\r\nThen she pants for breath, exhausted, and stumbles out through the circle.\r\n\r\nBut the little girls dance on.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children of the Ghetto possess all the qualities which make for\r\n\r\nnoble manhood and womanhood; but the Ghetto itself, like an infuriated\r\n\r\ntigress turning on its young, turns upon and destroys all these qualities,\r\n\r\nblots out the light and laughter, and moulds those it does not kill\r\n\r\ninto sodden and forlorn creatures, uncouth, degraded, and wretched below\r\n\r\nthe beasts of the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the manner in which this is done, I have in previous chapters\r\n\r\ndescribed it at length; here let Professor Huxley describe it in brief:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAny one who is acquainted with the state of the population\r\n\r\nof all great industrial centres, whether in this or other countries,\r\n\r\nis aware that amidst a large and increasing body of that population\r\n\r\nthere reigns supreme . . . that condition which the French call la\r\n\r\nmis\u00e8re, a word for which I do not think there is any exact\r\n\r\nEnglish equivalent. It is a condition in which the food, warmth,\r\n\r\nand clothing which are necessary for the mere maintenance of the functions\r\n\r\nof the body in their normal state cannot be obtained; in which men,\r\n\r\nwomen, and children are forced to crowd into dens wherein decency is\r\n\r\nabolished, and the most ordinary conditions of healthful existence are\r\n\r\nimpossible of attainment; in which the pleasures within reach are reduced\r\n\r\nto brutality and drunkenness; in which the pains accumulate at compound\r\n\r\ninterest in the shape of starvation, disease, stunted development, and\r\n\r\nmoral degradation; in which the prospect of even steady and honest industry\r\n\r\nis a life of unsuccessful battling with hunger, rounded by a pauper\u2019s\r\n\r\ngrave.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn such conditions, the outlook for children is hopeless. They\r\n\r\ndie like flies, and those that survive, survive because they possess\r\n\r\nexcessive vitality and a capacity of adaptation to the degradation with\r\n\r\nwhich they are surrounded. They have no home life. In the\r\n\r\ndens and lairs in which they live they are exposed to all that is obscene\r\n\r\nand indecent. And as their minds are made rotten, so are their\r\n\r\nbodies made rotten by bad sanitation, overcrowding, and underfeeding.\r\n\r\nWhen a father and mother live with three or four children in a room\r\n\r\nwhere the children take turn about in sitting up to drive the rats away\r\n\r\nfrom the sleepers, when those children never have enough to eat and\r\n\r\nare preyed upon and made miserable and weak by swarming vermin, the\r\n\r\nsort of men and women the survivors will make can readily be imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDull despair and misery\r\n\r\nLie about them from their birth;\r\n\r\nUgly curses, uglier mirth,\r\n\r\nAre their earliest lullaby.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nA man and a woman marry and set up housekeeping in one room. Their income does\r\n\r\nnot increase with the years, though their family does, and the man is\r\n\r\nexceedingly lucky if he can keep his health and his job. A baby comes, and then\r\n\r\nanother. This means that more room should be obtained; but these little mouths\r\n\r\nand bodies mean additional expense and make it absolutely impossible to get\r\n\r\nmore spacious quarters. More babies come. There is not room in which to turn\r\n\r\naround. The youngsters run the streets, and by the time they are twelve or\r\n\r\nfourteen the room-issue comes to a head, and out they go on the streets for\r\n\r\ngood. The boy, if he be lucky, can manage to make the common lodging-houses,\r\n\r\nand he may have any one of several ends. But the girl of fourteen or fifteen,\r\n\r\nforced in this manner to leave the one room called home, and able to earn at\r\n\r\nthe best a paltry five or six shillings per week, can have but one end. And the\r\n\r\nbitter end of that one end is such as that of the woman whose body the police\r\n\r\nfound this morning in a doorway in Dorset Street, Whitechapel. Homeless,\r\n\r\nshelterless, sick, with no one with her in her last hour, she had died in the\r\n\r\nnight of exposure. She was sixty-two years old and a match vendor. She died as\r\n\r\na wild animal dies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFresh in my mind is the picture of a boy in the dock of an East End\r\n\r\npolice court. His head was barely visible above the railing.\r\n\r\nHe was being proved guilty of stealing two shillings from a woman, which\r\n\r\nhe had spent, not for candy and cakes and a good time, but for food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask the woman for food?\u201d the magistrate\r\n\r\ndemanded, in a hurt sort of tone. \u201cShe would surely have\r\n\r\ngiven you something to eat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I \u2019ad arsked \u2019er, I\u2019d got locked up for\r\n\r\nbeggin\u2019,\u201d was the boy\u2019s reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magistrate knitted his brows and accepted the rebuke. Nobody\r\n\r\nknew the boy, nor his father or mother. He was without beginning\r\n\r\nor antecedent, a waif, a stray, a young cub seeking his food in the\r\n\r\njungle of empire, preying upon the weak and being preyed upon by the\r\n\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people who try to help, who gather up the Ghetto children and\r\n\r\nsend them away on a day\u2019s outing to the country, believe that\r\n\r\nnot very many children reach the age of ten without having had at least\r\n\r\none day there. Of this, a writer says: \u201cThe mental change\r\n\r\ncaused by one day so spent must not be undervalued. Whatever the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the children learn the meaning of fields and woods, so\r\n\r\nthat descriptions of country scenery in the books they read, which before\r\n\r\nconveyed no impression, become now intelligible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in the fields and woods, if they are lucky enough to be picked\r\n\r\nup by the people who try to help! And they are being born faster\r\n\r\nevery day than they can be carted off to the fields and woods for the\r\n\r\none day in their lives. One day! In all their lives, one\r\n\r\nday! And for the rest of the days, as the boy told a certain bishop,\r\n\r\n\u201cAt ten we \u2019ops the wag; at thirteen we nicks things; an\u2019\r\n\r\nat sixteen we bashes the copper.\u201d Which is to say, at ten\r\n\r\nthey play truant, at thirteen steal, and at sixteen are sufficiently\r\n\r\ndeveloped hooligans to smash the policemen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Cartmel Robinson tells of a boy and girl of his parish\r\n\r\nwho set out to walk to the forest. They walked and walked through\r\n\r\nthe never-ending streets, expecting always to see it by-and-by; until\r\n\r\nthey sat down at last, faint and despairing, and were rescued by a kind\r\n\r\nwoman who brought them back. Evidently they had been overlooked\r\n\r\nby the people who try to help.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman is authority for the statement that in a street\r\n\r\nin Hoxton (a district of the vast East End), over seven hundred children,\r\n\r\nbetween five and thirteen years, live in eighty small houses.\r\n\r\nAnd he adds: \u201cIt is because London has largely shut her children\r\n\r\nin a maze of streets and houses and robbed them of their rightful inheritance\r\n\r\nin sky and field and brook, that they grow up to be men and women physically\r\n\r\nunfit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe tells of a member of his congregation who let a basement room\r\n\r\nto a married couple. \u201cThey said they had two children; when\r\n\r\nthey got possession it turned out that they had four. After a\r\n\r\nwhile a fifth appeared, and the landlord gave them notice to quit.\r\n\r\nThey paid no attention to it. Then the sanitary inspector who\r\n\r\nhas to wink at the law so often, came in and threatened my friend with\r\n\r\nlegal proceedings. He pleaded that he could not get them out.\r\n\r\nThey pleaded that nobody would have them with so many children at a\r\n\r\nrental within their means, which is one of the commonest complaints\r\n\r\nof the poor, by-the-bye. What was to be done? The landlord\r\n\r\nwas between two millstones. Finally he applied to the magistrate,\r\n\r\nwho sent up an officer to inquire into the case. Since that time\r\n\r\nabout twenty days have elapsed, and nothing has yet been done.\r\n\r\nIs this a singular case? By no means; it is quite common.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nLast week the police raided a disorderly house. In one room\r\n\r\nwere found two young children. They were arrested and charged\r\n\r\nwith being inmates the same as the women had been. Their father\r\n\r\nappeared at the trial. He stated that himself and wife and two\r\n\r\nolder children, besides the two in the dock, occupied that room; he\r\n\r\nstated also that he occupied it because he could get no other room for\r\n\r\nthe half-crown a week he paid for it. The magistrate discharged\r\n\r\nthe two juvenile offenders and warned the father that he was bringing\r\n\r\nhis children up unhealthily.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there is no need further to multiply instances. In London\r\n\r\nthe slaughter of the innocents goes on on a scale more stupendous than\r\n\r\nany before in the history of the world. And equally stupendous\r\n\r\nis the callousness of the people who believe in Christ, acknowledge\r\n\r\nGod, and go to church regularly on Sunday. For the rest of the\r\n\r\nweek they riot about on the rents and profits which come to them from\r\n\r\nthe East End stained with the blood of the children. Also, at\r\n\r\ntimes, so peculiarly are they made, they will take half a million of\r\n\r\nthese rents and profits and send it away to educate the black boys of\r\n\r\nthe Soudan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nA VISION OF THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these were years ago little red-coloured, pulpy infants,\r\n\r\ncapable of being kneaded, baked, into any social form you chose.\u2014CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLate last night I walked along Commercial Street from Spitalfields\r\n\r\nto Whitechapel, and still continuing south, down Leman Street to the\r\n\r\ndocks. And as I walked I smiled at the East End papers, which,\r\n\r\nfilled with civic pride, boastfully proclaim that there is nothing the\r\n\r\nmatter with the East End as a living place for men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is rather hard to tell a tithe of what I saw. Much of it\r\n\r\nis untenable. But in a general way I may say that I saw a nightmare,\r\n\r\na fearful slime that quickened the pavement with life, a mess of unmentionable\r\n\r\nobscenity that put into eclipse the \u201cnightly horror\u201d of\r\n\r\nPiccadilly and the Strand. It was a menagerie of garmented\r\n\r\nbipeds that looked something like humans and more like beasts, and to\r\n\r\ncomplete the picture, brass-buttoned keepers kept order among them when\r\n\r\nthey snarled too fiercely.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was glad the keepers were there, for I did not have on my \u201cseafaring\u201d\r\n\r\nclothes, and I was what is called a \u201cmark\u201d for the creatures\r\n\r\nof prey that prowled up and down. At times, between keepers, these\r\n\r\nmales looked at me sharply, hungrily, gutter-wolves that they were,\r\n\r\nand I was afraid of their hands, of their naked hands, as one may be\r\n\r\nafraid of the paws of a gorilla. They reminded me of gorillas.\r\n\r\nTheir bodies were small, ill-shaped, and squat. There were no\r\n\r\nswelling muscles, no abundant thews and wide-spreading shoulders.\r\n\r\nThey exhibited, rather, an elemental economy of nature, such as the\r\n\r\ncave-men must have exhibited. But there was strength in those\r\n\r\nmeagre bodies, the ferocious, primordial strength to clutch and gripe\r\n\r\nand tear and rend. When they spring upon their human prey they\r\n\r\nare known even to bend the victim backward and double its body till\r\n\r\nthe back is broken. They possess neither conscience nor sentiment,\r\n\r\nand they will kill for a half-sovereign, without fear or favour, if\r\n\r\nthey are given but half a chance. They are a new species, a breed\r\n\r\nof city savages. The streets and houses, alleys and courts, are\r\n\r\ntheir hunting grounds. As valley and mountain are to the natural\r\n\r\nsavage, street and building are valley and mountain to them. The\r\n\r\nslum is their jungle, and they live and prey in the jungle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dear soft people of the golden theatres and wonder-mansions of\r\n\r\nthe West End do not see these creatures, do not dream that they exist.\r\n\r\nBut they are here, alive, very much alive in their jungle. And\r\n\r\nwoe the day, when England is fighting in her last trench, and her able-bodied\r\n\r\nmen are on the firing line! For on that day they will crawl out\r\n\r\nof their dens and lairs, and the people of the West End will see them,\r\n\r\nas the dear soft aristocrats of Feudal France saw them and asked one\r\n\r\nanother, \u201cWhence came they?\u201d \u201cAre they men?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut they were not the only beasts that ranged the menagerie.\r\n\r\nThey were only here and there, lurking in dark courts and passing like\r\n\r\ngrey shadows along the walls; but the women from whose rotten loins\r\n\r\nthey spring were everywhere. They whined insolently, and in maudlin\r\n\r\ntones begged me for pennies, and worse. They held carouse in every\r\n\r\nboozing ken, slatternly, unkempt, bleary-eyed, and towsled, leering\r\n\r\nand gibbering, overspilling with foulness and corruption, and, gone\r\n\r\nin debauch, sprawling across benches and bars, unspeakably repulsive,\r\n\r\nfearful to look upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there were others, strange, weird faces and forms and twisted\r\n\r\nmonstrosities that shouldered me on every side, inconceivable types\r\n\r\nof sodden ugliness, the wrecks of society, the perambulating carcasses,\r\n\r\nthe living deaths\u2014women, blasted by disease and drink till their\r\n\r\nshame brought not tuppence in the open mart; and men, in fantastic rags,\r\n\r\nwrenched by hardship and exposure out of all semblance of men, their\r\n\r\nfaces in a perpetual writhe of pain, grinning idiotically, shambling\r\n\r\nlike apes, dying with every step they took and each breath they drew.\r\n\r\nAnd there were young girls, of eighteen and twenty, with trim bodies\r\n\r\nand faces yet untouched with twist and bloat, who had fetched the bottom\r\n\r\nof the Abyss plump, in one swift fall. And I remember a lad of\r\n\r\nfourteen, and one of six or seven, white-faced and sickly, homeless,\r\n\r\nthe pair of them, who sat upon the pavement with their backs against\r\n\r\na railing and watched it all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unfit and the unneeded! Industry does not clamour for them.\r\n\r\nThere are no jobs going begging through lack of men and women.\r\n\r\nThe dockers crowd at the entrance gate, and curse and turn away when\r\n\r\nthe foreman does not give them a call. The engineers who have\r\n\r\nwork pay six shillings a week to their brother engineers who can find\r\n\r\nnothing to do; 514,000 textile workers oppose a resolution condemning\r\n\r\nthe employment of children under fifteen. Women, and plenty to\r\n\r\nspare, are found to toil under the sweat-shop masters for tenpence a\r\n\r\nday of fourteen hours. Alfred Freeman crawls to muddy death because\r\n\r\nhe loses his job. Ellen Hughes Hunt prefers Regent\u2019s Canal\r\n\r\nto Islington Workhouse. Frank Cavilla cuts the throats of his\r\n\r\nwife and children because he cannot find work enough to give them food\r\n\r\nand shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unfit and the unneeded! The miserable and despised and\r\n\r\nforgotten, dying in the social shambles. The progeny of prostitution\u2014of\r\n\r\nthe prostitution of men and women and children, of flesh and blood,\r\n\r\nand sparkle and spirit; in brief, the prostitution of labour.\r\n\r\nIf this is the best that civilisation can do for the human, then give\r\n\r\nus howling and naked savagery. Far better to be a people of the\r\n\r\nwilderness and desert, of the cave and the squatting-place, than to\r\n\r\nbe a people of the machine and the Abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNGER WAIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMy father has more stamina than I, for he is country-born.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speaker, a bright young East Ender, was lamenting his poor physical\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at my scrawny arm, will you.\u201d He pulled up\r\n\r\nhis sleeve. \u201cNot enough to eat, that\u2019s what\u2019s\r\n\r\nthe matter with it. Oh, not now. I have what I want to eat\r\n\r\nthese days. But it\u2019s too late. It can\u2019t make\r\n\r\nup for what I didn\u2019t have to eat when I was a kiddy. Dad\r\n\r\ncame up to London from the Fen Country. Mother died, and there\r\n\r\nwere six of us kiddies and dad living in two small rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had hard times, dad did. He might have chucked us,\r\n\r\nbut he didn\u2019t. He slaved all day, and at night he came home\r\n\r\nand cooked and cared for us. He was father and mother, both.\r\n\r\nHe did his best, but we didn\u2019t have enough to eat. We rarely\r\n\r\nsaw meat, and then of the worst. And it is not good for growing\r\n\r\nkiddies to sit down to a dinner of bread and a bit of cheese, and not\r\n\r\nenough of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the result? I am undersized, and I\r\n\r\nhaven\u2019t the stamina of my dad. It was starved out of me.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of generations there\u2019ll be no more of me here in London.\r\n\r\nYet there\u2019s my younger brother; he\u2019s bigger and better developed.\r\n\r\nYou see, dad and we children held together, and that accounts for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t see,\u201d I objected. \u201cI should\r\n\r\nthink, under such conditions, that the vitality should decrease and\r\n\r\nthe younger children be born weaker and weaker.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNot when they hold together,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhenever\r\n\r\nyou come along in the East End and see a child of from eight to twelve,\r\n\r\ngood-sized, well-developed, and healthy-looking, just you ask and you\r\n\r\nwill find that it is the youngest in the family, or at least is one\r\n\r\nof the younger. The way of it is this: the older children starve\r\n\r\nmore than the younger ones. By the time the younger ones come\r\n\r\nalong, the older ones are starting to work, and there is more money\r\n\r\ncoming in, and more food to go around.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe pulled down his sleeve, a concrete instance of where chronic semi-starvation\r\n\r\nkills not, but stunts. His voice was but one among the myriads\r\n\r\nthat raise the cry of the hunger wail in the greatest empire in the\r\n\r\nworld. On any one day, over 1,000,000 people are in receipt of\r\n\r\npoor-law relief in the United Kingdom. One in eleven of the whole\r\n\r\nworking-class receive poor-law relief in the course of the year; 37,500,000\r\n\r\npeople receive less than \u00a312 per month, per family; and a constant\r\n\r\narmy of 8,000,000 lives on the border of starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA committee of the London County school board makes this declaration: \u201cAt\r\n\r\ntimes, when there is no special distress, 55,000 children in a state of\r\n\r\nhunger, which makes it useless to attempt to teach them, are in the schools of\r\n\r\nLondon alone.\u201d The italics are mine. \u201cWhen there is no special\r\n\r\ndistress\u201d means good times in England; for the people of England have\r\n\r\ncome to look upon starvation and suffering, which they call\r\n\r\n\u201cdistress,\u201d as part of the social order. Chronic starvation is\r\n\r\nlooked upon as a matter of course. It is only when acute starvation makes its\r\n\r\nappearance on a large scale that they think something is unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the bitter wail of a blind man in a little East\r\n\r\nEnd shop at the close of a murky day. He had been the eldest of\r\n\r\nfive children, with a mother and no father. Being the eldest,\r\n\r\nhe had starved and worked as a child to put bread into the mouths of\r\n\r\nhis little brothers and sisters. Not once in three months did\r\n\r\nhe ever taste meat. He never knew what it was to have his hunger\r\n\r\nthoroughly appeased. And he claimed that this chronic starvation\r\n\r\nof his childhood had robbed him of his sight. To support the claim,\r\n\r\nhe quoted from the report of the Royal Commission on the Blind, \u201cBlindness\r\n\r\nis more prevalent in poor districts, and poverty accelerates this dreadful\r\n\r\naffliction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he went further, this blind man, and in his voice was the bitterness\r\n\r\nof an afflicted man to whom society did not give enough to eat.\r\n\r\nHe was one of an enormous army of blind in London, and he said that\r\n\r\nin the blind homes they did not receive half enough to eat. He\r\n\r\ngave the diet for a day:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde, God rest his soul, voices the cry of the prison child,\r\n\r\nwhich, in varying degree, is the cry of the prison man and woman:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe second thing from which a child suffers in prison is hunger.\r\n\r\nThe food that is given to it consists of a piece of usually bad-baked\r\n\r\nprison bread and a tin of water for breakfast at half-past seven.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\u2019clock it gets dinner, composed of a tin of coarse\r\n\r\nIndian meal stirabout (skilly), and at half-past five it gets a piece\r\n\r\nof dry bread and a tin of water for its supper. This diet in the\r\n\r\ncase of a strong grown man is always productive of illness of some kind,\r\n\r\nchiefly of course diarrhoea, with its attendant weakness. In fact,\r\n\r\nin a big prison astringent medicines are served out regularly by the\r\n\r\nwarders as a matter of course. In the case of a child, the child\r\n\r\nis, as a rule, incapable of eating the food at all. Any one who\r\n\r\nknows anything about children knows how easily a child\u2019s digestion\r\n\r\nis upset by a fit of crying, or trouble and mental distress of any kind.\r\n\r\nA child who has been crying all day long, and perhaps half the night,\r\n\r\nin a lonely dim-lit cell, and is preyed upon by terror, simply cannot\r\n\r\neat food of this coarse, horrible kind. In the case of the little\r\n\r\nchild to whom Warder Martin gave the biscuits, the child was crying\r\n\r\nwith hunger on Tuesday morning, and utterly unable to eat the bread\r\n\r\nand water served to it for its breakfast. Martin went out after\r\n\r\nthe breakfasts had been served and bought the few sweet biscuits for\r\n\r\nthe child rather than see it starving. It was a beautiful action\r\n\r\non his part, and was so recognised by the child, who, utterly unconscious\r\n\r\nof the regulations of the Prison Board, told one of the senior wardens\r\n\r\nhow kind this junior warden had been to him. The result was, of\r\n\r\ncourse, a report and a dismissal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Blatchford compares the workhouse pauper\u2019s daily diet\r\n\r\nwith the soldier\u2019s, which, when he was a soldier, was not considered\r\n\r\nliberal enough, and yet is twice as liberal as the pauper\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adult male pauper gets meat (outside of soup) but once a week,\r\n\r\nand the paupers \u201chave nearly all that pallid, pasty complexion\r\n\r\nwhich is the sure mark of starvation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a table, comparing the workhouse officer\u2019s weekly allowance:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as the same writer remarks: \u201cThe officer\u2019s diet is\r\n\r\nstill more liberal than the pauper\u2019s; but evidently it is not\r\n\r\nconsidered liberal enough, for a footnote is added to the officer\u2019s\r\n\r\ntable saying that \u2018a cash payment of two shillings and sixpence\r\n\r\na week is also made to each resident officer and servant.\u2019\r\n\r\nIf the pauper has ample food, why does the officer have more?\r\n\r\nAnd if the officer has not too much, can the pauper be properly fed\r\n\r\non less than half the amount?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is not alone the Ghetto-dweller, the prisoner, and the pauper\r\n\r\nthat starve. Hodge, of the country, does not know what it is always\r\n\r\nto have a full belly. In truth, it is his empty belly which has\r\n\r\ndriven him to the city in such great numbers. Let us investigate\r\n\r\nthe way of living of a labourer from a parish in the Bradfield Poor\r\n\r\nLaw Union, Berks. Supposing him to have two children, steady work,\r\n\r\na rent-free cottage, and an average weekly wage of thirteen shillings,\r\n\r\nwhich is equivalent to $3.25, then here is his weekly budget:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guardians of the workhouse in the above Union pride themselves\r\n\r\non their rigid economy. It costs per pauper per week:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the labourer whose budget has been described should quit his toil\r\n\r\nand go into the workhouse, he would cost the guardians for\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would require more than a guinea for the workhouse to care for\r\n\r\nhim and his family, which he, somehow, manages to do on thirteen shillings.\r\n\r\nAnd in addition, it is an understood fact that it is cheaper to cater\r\n\r\nfor a large number of people\u2014buying, cooking, and serving wholesale\u2014than\r\n\r\nit is to cater for a small number of people, say a family.\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at the time this budget was compiled, there was in\r\n\r\nthat parish another family, not of four, but eleven persons, who had\r\n\r\nto live on an income, not of thirteen shillings, but of twelve shillings\r\n\r\nper week (eleven shillings in winter), and which had, not a rent-free\r\n\r\ncottage, but a cottage for which it paid three shillings per week.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis must be understood, and understood clearly: Whatever is true\r\n\r\nof London in the way of poverty and degradation, is true of all England.\r\n\r\nWhile Paris is not by any means France, the city of London is England.\r\n\r\nThe frightful conditions which mark London an inferno likewise mark\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom an inferno. The argument that the decentralisation\r\n\r\nof London would ameliorate conditions is a vain thing and false.\r\n\r\nIf the 6,000,000 people of London were separated into one hundred cities\r\n\r\neach with a population of 60,000, misery would be decentralised but\r\n\r\nnot diminished. The sum of it would remain as large.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this instance, Mr. B. S. Rowntree, by an exhaustive analysis,\r\n\r\nhas proved for the country town what Mr. Charles Booth has proved for\r\n\r\nthe metropolis, that fully one-fourth of the dwellers are condemned\r\n\r\nto a poverty which destroys them physically and spiritually; that fully\r\n\r\none-fourth of the dwellers do not have enough to eat, are inadequately\r\n\r\nclothed, sheltered, and warmed in a rigorous climate, and are doomed\r\n\r\nto a moral degeneracy which puts them lower than the savage in cleanliness\r\n\r\nand decency.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter listening to the wail of an old Irish peasant in Kerry, Robert\r\n\r\nBlatchford asked him what he wanted. \u201cThe old man leaned\r\n\r\nupon his spade and looked out across the black peat fields at the lowering\r\n\r\nskies. \u2018What is it that I\u2019m wantun?\u2019 he said;\r\n\r\nthen in a deep plaintive tone he continued, more to himself than to\r\n\r\nme, \u2018All our brave bhoys and dear gurrls is away an\u2019 over\r\n\r\nthe says, an\u2019 the agent has taken the pig off me, an\u2019 the\r\n\r\nwet has spiled the praties, an\u2019 I\u2019m an owld man, an\u2019\r\n\r\nI want the Day av Judgment.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Day of Judgment! More than he want it. From all the\r\n\r\nland rises the hunger wail, from Ghetto and countryside, from prison\r\n\r\nand casual ward, from asylum and workhouse\u2014the cry of the people\r\n\r\nwho have not enough to eat. Millions of people, men, women, children,\r\n\r\nlittle babes, the blind, the deaf, the halt, the sick, vagabonds and\r\n\r\ntoilers, prisoners and paupers, the people of Ireland, England, Scotland,\r\n\r\nWales, who have not enough to eat. And this, in face of the fact\r\n\r\nthat five men can produce bread for a thousand; that one workman can\r\n\r\nproduce cotton cloth for 250 people, woollens for 300, and boots and\r\n\r\nshoes for 1000. It would seem that 40,000,000 people are keeping\r\n\r\na big house, and that they are keeping it badly. The income is\r\n\r\nall right, but there is something criminally wrong with the management.\r\n\r\nAnd who dares to say that it is not criminally mismanaged, this big\r\n\r\nhouse, when five men can produce bread for a thousand, and yet millions\r\n\r\nhave not enough to eat?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nDRINK, TEMPERANCE, AND THRIFT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English working classes may be said to be soaked in beer.\r\n\r\nThey are made dull and sodden by it. Their efficiency is sadly\r\n\r\nimpaired, and they lose whatever imagination, invention, and quickness\r\n\r\nmay be theirs by right of race. It may hardly be called an acquired\r\n\r\nhabit, for they are accustomed to it from their earliest infancy.\r\n\r\nChildren are begotten in drunkenness, saturated in drink before they\r\n\r\ndraw their first breath, born to the smell and taste of it, and brought\r\n\r\nup in the midst of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public-house is ubiquitous. It flourishes on every corner\r\n\r\nand between corners, and it is frequented almost as much by women as\r\n\r\nby men. Children are to be found in it as well, waiting till their\r\n\r\nfathers and mothers are ready to go home, sipping from the glasses of\r\n\r\ntheir elders, listening to the coarse language and degrading conversation,\r\n\r\ncatching the contagion of it, familiarising themselves with licentiousness\r\n\r\nand debauchery.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Grundy rules as supremely over the workers as she does over\r\n\r\nthe bourgeoisie; but in the case of the workers, the one thing she does\r\n\r\nnot frown upon is the public-house. No disgrace or shame attaches\r\n\r\nto it, nor to the young woman or girl who makes a practice of entering\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember a girl in a coffee-house saying, \u201cI never drink\r\n\r\nspirits when in a public-\u2019ouse.\u201d She was a young and\r\n\r\npretty waitress, and she was laying down to another waitress her pre-eminent\r\n\r\nrespectability and discretion. Mrs. Grundy drew the line at spirits,\r\n\r\nbut allowed that it was quite proper for a clean young girl to drink\r\n\r\nbeer, and to go into a public-house to drink it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only is this beer unfit for the people to drink, but too often\r\n\r\nthe men and women are unfit to drink it. On the other hand, it\r\n\r\nis their very unfitness that drives them to drink it. Ill-fed,\r\n\r\nsuffering from innutrition and the evil effects of overcrowding and\r\n\r\nsqualor, their constitutions develop a morbid craving for the drink,\r\n\r\njust as the sickly stomach of the overstrung Manchester factory operative\r\n\r\nhankers after excessive quantities of pickles and similar weird foods.\r\n\r\nUnhealthy working and living engenders unhealthy appetites and desires.\r\n\r\nMan cannot be worked worse than a horse is worked, and be housed and\r\n\r\nfed as a pig is housed and fed, and at the same time have clean and\r\n\r\nwholesome ideals and aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs home-life vanishes, the public-house appears. Not only do\r\n\r\nmen and women abnormally crave drink, who are overworked, exhausted,\r\n\r\nsuffering from deranged stomachs and bad sanitation, and deadened by\r\n\r\nthe ugliness and monotony of existence, but the gregarious men and women\r\n\r\nwho have no home-life flee to the bright and clattering public-house\r\n\r\nin a vain attempt to express their gregariousness. And when a\r\n\r\nfamily is housed in one small room, home-life is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief examination of such a dwelling will serve to bring to light\r\n\r\none important cause of drunkenness. Here the family arises in\r\n\r\nthe morning, dresses, and makes its toilet, father, mother, sons, and\r\n\r\ndaughters, and in the same room, shoulder to shoulder (for the room\r\n\r\nis small), the wife and mother cooks the breakfast. And in the\r\n\r\nsame room, heavy and sickening with the exhalations of their packed\r\n\r\nbodies throughout the night, that breakfast is eaten. The father\r\n\r\ngoes to work, the elder children go to school or into the street, and\r\n\r\nthe mother remains with her crawling, toddling youngsters to do her\r\n\r\nhousework\u2014still in the same room. Here she washes the clothes,\r\n\r\nfilling the pent space with soapsuds and the smell of dirty clothes,\r\n\r\nand overhead she hangs the wet linen to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, in the evening, amid the manifold smells of the day, the family\r\n\r\ngoes to its virtuous couch. That is to say, as many as possible\r\n\r\npile into the one bed (if bed they have), and the surplus turns in on\r\n\r\nthe floor. And this is the round of their existence, month after\r\n\r\nmonth, year after year, for they never get a vacation save when they\r\n\r\nare evicted. When a child dies, and some are always bound to die,\r\n\r\nsince fifty-five per cent. of the East End children die before they\r\n\r\nare five years old, the body is laid out in the same room. And\r\n\r\nif they are very poor, it is kept for some time until they can bury\r\n\r\nit. During the day it lies on the bed; during the night, when\r\n\r\nthe living take the bed, the dead occupies the table, from which, in\r\n\r\nthe morning, when the dead is put back into the bed, they eat their\r\n\r\nbreakfast. Sometimes the body is placed on the shelf which serves\r\n\r\nas a pantry for their food. Only a couple of weeks ago, an East\r\n\r\nEnd woman was in trouble, because, in this fashion, being unable to\r\n\r\nbury it, she had kept her dead child three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow such a room as I have described is not home but horror; and the\r\n\r\nmen and women who flee away from it to the public-house are to be pitied,\r\n\r\nnot blamed. There are 300,000 people, in London, divided into\r\n\r\nfamilies that live in single rooms, while there are 900,000 who are\r\n\r\nillegally housed according to the Public Health Act of 1891\u2014a\r\n\r\nrespectable recruiting-ground for the drink traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there are the insecurity of happiness, the precariousness of\r\n\r\nexistence, the well-founded fear of the future\u2014potent factors\r\n\r\nin driving people to drink. Wretchedness squirms for alleviation,\r\n\r\nand in the public-house its pain is eased and forgetfulness is obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is unhealthy. Certainly it is, but everything else about their\r\n\r\nlives is unhealthy, while this brings the oblivion that nothing else\r\n\r\nin their lives can bring. It even exalts them, and makes them\r\n\r\nfeel that they are finer and better, though at the same time it drags\r\n\r\nthem down and makes them more beastly than ever. For the unfortunate\r\n\r\nman or woman, it is a race between miseries that ends with death.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of no avail to preach temperance and teetotalism to these people.\r\n\r\nThe drink habit may be the cause of many miseries; but it is, in turn,\r\n\r\nthe effect of other and prior miseries. The temperance advocates\r\n\r\nmay preach their hearts out over the evils of drink, but until the evils\r\n\r\nthat cause people to drink are abolished, drink and its evils will remain.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the people who try to help realise this, their well-intentioned\r\n\r\nefforts will be futile, and they will present a spectacle fit only to\r\n\r\nset Olympus laughing. I have gone through an exhibition of Japanese\r\n\r\nart, got up for the poor of Whitechapel with the idea of elevating them,\r\n\r\nof begetting in them yearnings for the Beautiful and True and Good.\r\n\r\nGranting (what is not so) that the poor folk are thus taught to know\r\n\r\nand yearn after the Beautiful and True and Good, the foul facts of their\r\n\r\nexistence and the social law that dooms one in three to a public-charity\r\n\r\ndeath, demonstrate that this knowledge and yearning will be only so\r\n\r\nmuch of an added curse to them. They will have so much more to\r\n\r\nforget than if they had never known and yearned. Did Destiny to-day\r\n\r\nbind me down to the life of an East End slave for the rest of my years,\r\n\r\nand did Destiny grant me but one wish, I should ask that I might forget\r\n\r\nall about the Beautiful and True and Good; that I might forget all I\r\n\r\nhad learned from the open books, and forget the people I had known,\r\n\r\nthe things I had heard, and the lands I had seen. And if Destiny\r\n\r\ndidn\u2019t grant it, I am pretty confident that I should get drunk\r\n\r\nand forget it as often as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese people who try to help! Their college settlements, missions,\r\n\r\ncharities, and what not, are failures. In the nature of things\r\n\r\nthey cannot but be failures. They are wrongly, though sincerely,\r\n\r\nconceived. They approach life through a misunderstanding of life,\r\n\r\nthese good folk. They do not understand the West End, yet they\r\n\r\ncome down to the East End as teachers and savants. They do not\r\n\r\nunderstand the simple sociology of Christ, yet they come to the miserable\r\n\r\nand the despised with the pomp of social redeemers. They have\r\n\r\nworked faithfully, but beyond relieving an infinitesimal fraction of\r\n\r\nmisery and collecting a certain amount of data which might otherwise\r\n\r\nhave been more scientifically and less expensively collected, they have\r\n\r\nachieved nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs some one has said, they do everything for the poor except get\r\n\r\noff their backs. The very money they dribble out in their child\u2019s\r\n\r\nschemes has been wrung from the poor. They come from a race of\r\n\r\nsuccessful and predatory bipeds who stand between the worker and his\r\n\r\nwages, and they try to tell the worker what he shall do with the pitiful\r\n\r\nbalance left to him. Of what use, in the name of God, is it to\r\n\r\nestablish nurseries for women workers, in which, for instance, a child\r\n\r\nis taken while the mother makes violets in Islington at three farthings\r\n\r\na gross, when more children and violet-makers than they can cope with\r\n\r\nare being born right along? This violet-maker handles each flower\r\n\r\nfour times, 576 handlings for three farthings, and in the day she handles\r\n\r\nthe flowers 6912 times for a wage of ninepence. She is being robbed.\r\n\r\nSomebody is on her back, and a yearning for the Beautiful and True and\r\n\r\nGood will not lighten her burden. They do nothing for her, these\r\n\r\ndabblers; and what they do not do for the mother, undoes at night, when\r\n\r\nthe child comes home, all that they have done for the child in the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd one and all, they join in teaching a fundamental lie. They\r\n\r\ndo not know it is a lie, but their ignorance does not make it more of\r\n\r\na truth. And the lie they preach is \u201cthrift.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn instant will demonstrate it. In overcrowded London, the struggle\r\n\r\nfor a chance to work is keen, and because of this struggle wages sink\r\n\r\nto the lowest means of subsistence. To be thrifty means for a\r\n\r\nworker to spend less than his income\u2014in other words, to live on\r\n\r\nless. This is equivalent to a lowering of the standard of living.\r\n\r\nIn the competition for a chance to work, the man with a lower standard\r\n\r\nof living will underbid the man with a higher standard. And a\r\n\r\nsmall group of such thrifty workers in any overcrowded industry will\r\n\r\npermanently lower the wages of that industry. And the thrifty\r\n\r\nones will no longer be thrifty, for their income will have been reduced\r\n\r\ntill it balances their expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, thrift negates thrift. If every worker in England\r\n\r\nshould heed the preachers of thrift and cut expenditure in half, the\r\n\r\ncondition of there being more men to work than there is work to do would\r\n\r\nswiftly cut wages in half. And then none of the workers of England\r\n\r\nwould be thrifty, for they would be living up to their diminished incomes.\r\n\r\nThe short-sighted thrift-preachers would naturally be astounded at the\r\n\r\noutcome. The measure of their failure would be precisely the measure\r\n\r\nof the success of their propaganda. And, anyway, it is sheer bosh\r\n\r\nand nonsense to preach thrift to the 1,800,000 London workers who are\r\n\r\ndivided into families which have a total income of less than 21s. per\r\n\r\nweek, one quarter to one half of which must be paid for rent.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the futility of the people who try to help, I wish to\r\n\r\nmake one notable, noble exception, namely, the Dr. Barnardo Homes.\r\n\r\nDr. Barnardo is a child-catcher. First, he catches them when they\r\n\r\nare young, before they are set, hardened, in the vicious social mould;\r\n\r\nand then he sends them away to grow up and be formed in another and\r\n\r\nbetter social mould. Up to date he has sent out of the country\r\n\r\n13,340 boys, most of them to Canada, and not one in fifty has failed.\r\n\r\nA splendid record, when it is considered that these lads are waifs and\r\n\r\nstrays, homeless and parentless, jerked out from the very bottom of\r\n\r\nthe Abyss, and forty-nine out of fifty of them made into men.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery twenty-four hours in the year Dr. Barnardo snatches nine waifs\r\n\r\nfrom the streets; so the enormous field he has to work in may be comprehended.\r\n\r\nThe people who try to help have something to learn from him. He\r\n\r\ndoes not play with palliatives. He traces social viciousness and\r\n\r\nmisery to their sources. He removes the progeny of the gutter-folk\r\n\r\nfrom their pestilential environment, and gives them a healthy, wholesome\r\n\r\nenvironment in which to be pressed and prodded and moulded into men.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the people who try to help cease their playing and dabbling\r\n\r\nwith day nurseries and Japanese art exhibits and go back and learn their\r\n\r\nWest End and the sociology of Christ, they will be in better shape to\r\n\r\nbuckle down to the work they ought to be doing in the world. And\r\n\r\nif they do buckle down to the work, they will follow Dr. Barnardo\u2019s\r\n\r\nlead, only on a scale as large as the nation is large. They won\u2019t\r\n\r\ncram yearnings for the Beautiful, and True, and Good down the throat\r\n\r\nof the woman making violets for three farthings a gross, but they will\r\n\r\nmake somebody get off her back and quit cramming himself till, like\r\n\r\nthe Romans, he must go to a bath and sweat it out. And to their\r\n\r\nconsternation, they will find that they will have to get off that woman\u2019s\r\n\r\nback themselves, as well as the backs of a few other women and children\r\n\r\nthey did not dream they were riding upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this final chapter it were well to look at the Social Abyss in\r\n\r\nits widest aspect, and to put certain questions to Civilisation, by\r\n\r\nthe answers to which Civilisation must stand or fall. For instance,\r\n\r\nhas Civilisation bettered the lot of man? \u201cMan,\u201d I\r\n\r\nuse in its democratic sense, meaning the average man. So the question\r\n\r\nre-shapes itself: Has Civilisation bettered the lot of the average\r\n\r\nman?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us see. In Alaska, along the banks of the Yukon River, near its mouth, live\r\n\r\nthe Innuit folk. They are a very primitive people, manifesting but mere\r\n\r\nglimmering adumbrations of that tremendous artifice, Civilisation. Their\r\n\r\ncapital amounts possibly to \u00a32 per head. They hunt and fish for their\r\n\r\nfood with bone-headed spears and arrows. They never suffer from lack of\r\n\r\nshelter. Their clothes, largely made from the skins of animals, are warm. They\r\n\r\nalways have fuel for their fires, likewise timber for their houses, which they\r\n\r\nbuild partly underground, and in which they lie snugly during the periods of\r\n\r\nintense cold. In the summer they live in tents, open to every breeze and cool.\r\n\r\nThey are healthy, and strong, and happy. Their one problem is food. They have\r\n\r\ntheir times of plenty and times of famine. In good times they feast; in bad\r\n\r\ntimes they die of starvation. But starvation, as a chronic condition, present\r\n\r\nwith a large number of them all the time, is a thing unknown. Further, they\r\n\r\nhave no debts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, on the rim of the Western Ocean, live the\r\n\r\nEnglish folk. They are a consummately civilised people.\r\n\r\nTheir capital amounts to at least \u00a3300 per head. They gain\r\n\r\ntheir food, not by hunting and fishing, but by toil at colossal artifices.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, they suffer from lack of shelter. The greater\r\n\r\nnumber of them are vilely housed, do not have enough fuel to keep them\r\n\r\nwarm, and are insufficiently clothed. A constant number never\r\n\r\nhave any houses at all, and sleep shelterless under the stars.\r\n\r\nMany are to be found, winter and summer, shivering on the streets in\r\n\r\ntheir rags. They have good times and bad. In good times\r\n\r\nmost of them manage to get enough to eat, in bad times they die of starvation.\r\n\r\nThey are dying now, they were dying yesterday and last year, they will\r\n\r\ndie to-morrow and next year, of starvation; for they, unlike the Innuit,\r\n\r\nsuffer from a chronic condition of starvation. There are 40,000,000\r\n\r\nof the English folk, and 939 out of every 1000 of them die in poverty,\r\n\r\nwhile a constant army of 8,000,000 struggles on the ragged edge of starvation.\r\n\r\nFurther, each babe that is born, is born in debt to the sum of \u00a322.\r\n\r\nThis is because of an artifice called the National Debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a fair comparison of the average Innuit and the average Englishman,\r\n\r\nit will be seen that life is less rigorous for the Innuit; that while\r\n\r\nthe Innuit suffers only during bad times from starvation, the Englishman\r\n\r\nsuffers during good times as well; that no Innuit lacks fuel, clothing,\r\n\r\nor housing, while the Englishman is in perpetual lack of these three\r\n\r\nessentials. In this connection it is well to instance the judgment\r\n\r\nof a man such as Huxley. From the knowledge gained as a medical\r\n\r\nofficer in the East End of London, and as a scientist pursuing investigations\r\n\r\namong the most elemental savages, he concludes, \u201cWere the alternative\r\n\r\npresented to me, I would deliberately prefer the life of the savage\r\n\r\nto that of those people of Christian London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creature comforts man enjoys are the products of man\u2019s\r\n\r\nlabour. Since Civilisation has failed to give the average Englishman\r\n\r\nfood and shelter equal to that enjoyed by the Innuit, the question arises:\r\n\r\nHas Civilisation increased the producing power of the average man?\r\n\r\nIf it has not increased man\u2019s producing power, then Civilisation\r\n\r\ncannot stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, it will be instantly admitted, Civilisation has increased man\u2019s\r\n\r\nproducing power. Five men can produce bread for a thousand.\r\n\r\nOne man can produce cotton cloth for 250 people, woollens for 300, and\r\n\r\nboots and shoes for 1000. Yet it has been shown throughout the\r\n\r\npages of this book that English folk by the millions do not receive\r\n\r\nenough food, clothes, and boots. Then arises the third and inexorable\r\n\r\nquestion: If Civilisation has increased the producing power of the\r\n\r\naverage man, why has it not bettered the lot of the average man?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be one answer only\u2014MISMANAGEMENT. Civilisation\r\n\r\nhas made possible all manner of creature comforts and heart\u2019s\r\n\r\ndelights. In these the average Englishman does not participate.\r\n\r\nIf he shall be forever unable to participate, then Civilisation falls.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for the continued existence of an artifice so avowed\r\n\r\na failure. But it is impossible that men should have reared this\r\n\r\ntremendous artifice in vain. It stuns the intellect. To\r\n\r\nacknowledge so crushing a defeat is to give the death-blow to striving\r\n\r\nand progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other alternative, and one other only, presents itself. Civilisation\r\n\r\nmust be compelled to better the lot of the average man. This accepted, it\r\n\r\nbecomes at once a question of business management. Things profitable must be\r\n\r\ncontinued; things unprofitable must be eliminated. Either the Empire is a\r\n\r\nprofit to England, or it is a loss. If it is a loss, it must be done away with.\r\n\r\nIf it is a profit, it must be managed so that the average man comes in for a\r\n\r\nshare of the profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the struggle for commercial supremacy is profitable, continue\r\n\r\nit. If it is not, if it hurts the worker and makes his lot worse\r\n\r\nthan the lot of a savage, then fling foreign markets and industrial\r\n\r\nempire overboard. For it is a patent fact that if 40,000,000 people,\r\n\r\naided by Civilisation, possess a greater individual producing power\r\n\r\nthan the Innuit, then those 40,000,000 people should enjoy more creature\r\n\r\ncomforts and heart\u2019s delights than the Innuits enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the 400,000 English gentlemen, \u201cof no occupation,\u201d\r\n\r\naccording to their own statement in the Census of 1881, are unprofitable,\r\n\r\ndo away with them. Set them to work ploughing game preserves and\r\n\r\nplanting potatoes. If they are profitable, continue them by all\r\n\r\nmeans, but let it be seen to that the average Englishman shares somewhat\r\n\r\nin the profits they produce by working at no occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, society must be reorganised, and a capable management put\r\n\r\nat the head. That the present management is incapable, there can\r\n\r\nbe no discussion. It has drained the United Kingdom of its life-blood.\r\n\r\nIt has enfeebled the stay-at-home folk till they are unable longer to\r\n\r\nstruggle in the van of the competing nations. It has built up\r\n\r\na West End and an East End as large as the Kingdom is large, in which\r\n\r\none end is riotous and rotten, the other end sickly and underfed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA vast empire is foundering on the hands of this incapable management.\r\n\r\nAnd by empire is meant the political machinery which holds together\r\n\r\nthe English-speaking people of the world outside of the United States.\r\n\r\nNor is this charged in a pessimistic spirit. Blood empire is greater\r\n\r\nthan political empire, and the English of the New World and the Antipodes\r\n\r\nare strong and vigorous as ever. But the political empire under\r\n\r\nwhich they are nominally assembled is perishing. The political\r\n\r\nmachine known as the British Empire is running down. In the hands\r\n\r\nof its management it is losing momentum every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable that this management, which has grossly and criminally\r\n\r\nmismanaged, shall be swept away. Not only has it been wasteful\r\n\r\nand inefficient, but it has misappropriated the funds. Every worn-out,\r\n\r\npasty-faced pauper, every blind man, every prison babe, every man, woman,\r\n\r\nand child whose belly is gnawing with hunger pangs, is hungry because\r\n\r\nthe funds have been misappropriated by the management.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor can one member of this managing class plead not guilty before\r\n\r\nthe judgment bar of Man. \u201cThe living in their houses, and\r\n\r\nin their graves the dead,\u201d are challenged by every babe that dies\r\n\r\nof innutrition, by every girl that flees the sweater\u2019s den to\r\n\r\nthe nightly promenade of Piccadilly, by every worked-out toiler that\r\n\r\nplunges into the canal. The food this managing class eats, the\r\n\r\nwine it drinks, the shows it makes, and the fine clothes it wears, are\r\n\r\nchallenged by eight million mouths which have never had enough to fill\r\n\r\nthem, and by twice eight million bodies which have never been sufficiently\r\n\r\nclothed and housed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no mistake. Civilisation has increased man\u2019s\r\n\r\nproducing power an hundred-fold, and through mismanagement the men of\r\n\r\nCivilisation live worse than the beasts, and have less to eat and wear\r\n\r\nand protect them from the elements than the savage Innuit in a frigid\r\n\r\nclimate who lives to-day as he lived in the stone age ten thousand years\r\n\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a vague remembrance\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of a story that is told\r\n\r\nIn some ancient Spanish legend\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or chronicle of old.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was when brave King Sanchez\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was before Zamora slain,\r\n\r\nAnd his great besieging army\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lay encamped upon the plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Diego de Ordenez\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sallied forth in front of all,\r\n\r\nAnd shouted loud his challenge\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the warders on the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the people of Zamora,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both the born and the unborn,\r\n\r\nAs traitors did he challenge\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With taunting words of scorn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe living in their houses,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And in their graves the dead,\r\n\r\nAnd the waters in their rivers,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And their wine, and oil, and bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a greater army\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That besets us round with strife,\r\n\r\nA starving, numberless army\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At all the gates of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poverty-stricken millions\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who challenge our wine and bread,\r\n\r\nAnd impeach us all as traitors,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both the living and the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whenever I sit at the banquet,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the feast and song are high,\r\n\r\nAmid the mirth and music\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I can hear that fearful cry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd hollow and haggard faces\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Look into the lighted hall,\r\n\r\nAnd wasted hands are extended\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To catch the crumbs that fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd within there is light and plenty,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And odours fill the air;\r\n\r\nBut without there is cold and darkness,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And hunger and despair.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there in the camp of famine,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In wind, and cold, and rain,\r\n\r\nChrist, the great Lord of the Army,\r\n\r\nvLies dead upon the plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGFELLOW
