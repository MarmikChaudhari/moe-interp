In Which We Begin Not to Understand\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It is not without a certain emotion that I begin to recount here the\r\n\r\n      extraordinary adventures of Joseph Rouletabille. Down to the present time\r\n\r\n      he had so firmly opposed my doing it that I had come to despair of ever\r\n\r\n      publishing the most curious of police stories of the past fifteen years. I\r\n\r\n      had even imagined that the public would never know the whole truth of the\r\n\r\n      prodigious case known as that of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, out of which grew so\r\n\r\n      many mysterious, cruel, and sensational dramas, with which my friend was\r\n\r\n      so closely mixed up, if, propos of a recent nomination of the illustrious\r\n\r\n      Stangerson to the grade of grandcross of the Legion of Honour, an evening\r\n\r\n      journal\u2014in an article, miserable for its ignorance, or audacious for\r\n\r\n      its perfidy\u2014had not resuscitated a terrible adventure of which\r\n\r\n      Joseph Rouletabille had told me he wished to be for ever forgotten.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d! Who now remembers this affair which caused so much ink to\r\n\r\n      flow fifteen years ago? Events are so quickly forgotten in Paris. Has not\r\n\r\n      the very name of the Nayves trial and the tragic history of the death of\r\n\r\n      little Menaldo passed out of mind? And yet the public attention was so\r\n\r\n      deeply interested in the details of the trial that the occurrence of a\r\n\r\n      ministerial crisis was completely unnoticed at the time. Now The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room trial, which, preceded that of the Nayves by some years, made far\r\n\r\n      more noise. The entire world hung for months over this obscure problem\u2014the\r\n\r\n      most obscure, it seems to me, that has ever challenged the perspicacity of\r\n\r\n      our police or taxed the conscience of our judges. The solution of the\r\n\r\n      problem baffled everybody who tried to find it. It was like a dramatic\r\n\r\n      rebus with which old Europe and new America alike became fascinated. That\r\n\r\n      is, in truth\u2014I am permitted to say, because there cannot be any\r\n\r\n      author\u2019s vanity in all this, since I do nothing more than transcribe facts\r\n\r\n      on which an exceptional documentation enables me to throw a new light\u2014that\r\n\r\n      is because, in truth, I do not know that, in the domain of reality or\r\n\r\n      imagination, one can discover or recall to mind anything comparable, in\r\n\r\n      its mystery, with the natural mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      That which nobody could find out, Joseph Rouletabille, aged eighteen, then\r\n\r\n      a reporter engaged on a leading journal, succeeded in discovering. But\r\n\r\n      when, at the Assize Court, he brought in the key to the whole case, he did\r\n\r\n      not tell the whole truth. He only allowed so much of it to appear as\r\n\r\n      sufficed to ensure the acquittal of an innocent man. The reasons which he\r\n\r\n      had for his reticence no longer exist. Better still, the time has come for\r\n\r\n      my friend to speak out fully. You are going to know all; and, without\r\n\r\n      further preamble, I am going to place before your eyes the problem of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room as it was placed before the eyes of the entire world on the\r\n\r\n      day following the enactment of the drama at the Chateau du Glandier.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the 25th of October, 1892, the following note appeared in the latest\r\n\r\n      edition of the \u201cTemps\u201d:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA frightful crime has been committed at the Glandier, on the border of\r\n\r\n      the forest of Sainte-Genevieve, above Epinay-sur-Orge, at the house of\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson. On that night, while the master was working in his\r\n\r\n      laboratory, an attempt was made to assassinate Mademoiselle Stangerson,\r\n\r\n      who was sleeping in a chamber adjoining this laboratory. The doctors do\r\n\r\n      not answer for the life of Mdlle. Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The impression made on Paris by this news may be easily imagined. Already,\r\n\r\n      at that time, the learned world was deeply interested in the labours of\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson and his daughter. These labours\u2014the first that\r\n\r\n      were attempted in radiography\u2014served to open the way for Monsieur\r\n\r\n      and Madame Curie to the discovery of radium. It was expected the Professor\r\n\r\n      would shortly read to the Academy of Sciences a sensational paper on his\r\n\r\n      new theory,\u2014the Dissociation of Matter,\u2014a theory destined to\r\n\r\n      overthrow from its base the whole of official science, which based itself\r\n\r\n      on the principle of the Conservation of Energy. On the following day, the\r\n\r\n      newspapers were full of the tragedy. The \u201cMatin,\u201d among others, published\r\n\r\n      the following article, entitled: \u201cA Supernatural Crime\u201d:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThese are the only details,\u201d wrote the anonymous writer in the \u201cMatin\u201d\u2014\u201cwe\r\n\r\n      have been able to obtain concerning the crime of the Chateau du Glandier.\r\n\r\n      The state of despair in which Professor Stangerson is plunged, and the\r\n\r\n      impossibility of getting any information from the lips of the victim, have\r\n\r\n      rendered our investigations and those of justice so difficult that, at\r\n\r\n      present, we cannot form the least idea of what has passed in The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room in which Mdlle. Stangerson, in her night-dress, was found lying on\r\n\r\n      the floor in the agonies of death. We have, at least, been able to\r\n\r\n      interview Daddy Jacques\u2014as he is called in the country\u2014a old\r\n\r\n      servant in the Stangerson family. Daddy Jacques entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d at the\r\n\r\n      same time as the Professor. This chamber adjoins the laboratory.\r\n\r\n      Laboratory and Yellow Room are in a pavilion at the end of the park, about\r\n\r\n      three hundred metres (a thousand feet) from the chateau.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It was half-past twelve at night,\u2019 this honest old man told us, \u2018and I\r\n\r\n      was in the laboratory, where Monsieur Stangerson was still working, when\r\n\r\n      the thing happened. I had been cleaning and putting instruments in order\r\n\r\n      all the evening and was waiting for Monsieur Stangerson to go to bed.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had worked with her father up to midnight; when\r\n\r\n      the twelve strokes of midnight had sounded by the cuckoo-clock in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory, she rose, kissed Monsieur Stangerson and bade him good-night.\r\n\r\n      To me she said \u201cbon soir, Daddy Jacques\u201d as she passed into The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room. We heard her lock the door and shoot the bolt, so that I could not\r\n\r\n      help laughing, and said to Monsieur: \u201cThere\u2019s Mademoiselle double-locking\r\n\r\n      herself in,\u2014she must be afraid of the \u2018Bete du bon Dieu!\u2019\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n      did not even hear me, he was so deeply absorbed in what he was doing. Just\r\n\r\n      then we heard the distant miawing of a cat. \u201cIs that going to keep us\r\n\r\n      awake all night?\u201d I said to myself; for I must tell you, Monsieur, that,\r\n\r\n      to the end of October, I live in an attic of the pavilion over The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room, so that Mademoiselle should not be left alone through the night in\r\n\r\n      the lonely park. It was the fancy of Mademoiselle to spend the fine\r\n\r\n      weather in the pavilion; no doubt, she found it more cheerful than the\r\n\r\n      chateau and, for the four years it had been built, she had never failed to\r\n\r\n      take up her lodging there in the spring. With the return of winter,\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle returns to the chateau, for there is no fireplace in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018We were staying in the pavilion, then\u2014Monsieur Stangerson and me.\r\n\r\n      We made no noise. He was seated at his desk. As for me, I was sitting on a\r\n\r\n      chair, having finished my work and, looking at him, I said to myself:\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a man!\u2014what intelligence!\u2014what knowledge!\u201d I attach\r\n\r\n      importance to the fact that we made no noise; for, because of that, the\r\n\r\n      assassin certainly thought that we had left the place. And, suddenly,\r\n\r\n      while the cuckoo was sounding the half after midnight, a desperate clamour\r\n\r\n      broke out in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. It was the voice of Mademoiselle, crying\r\n\r\n      \u201cMurder!\u2014murder!\u2014help!\u201d Immediately afterwards revolver shots\r\n\r\n      rang out and there was a great noise of tables and furniture being thrown\r\n\r\n      to the ground, as if in the course of a struggle, and again the voice of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle calling, \u201cMurder!\u2014help!\u2014Papa!\u2014Papa!\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You may be sure that we quickly sprang up and that Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n      and I threw ourselves upon the door. But alas! it was locked, fast locked,\r\n\r\n      on the inside, by the care of Mademoiselle, as I have told you, with key\r\n\r\n      and bolt. We tried to force it open, but it remained firm. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was like a madman, and truly, it was enough to make him one,\r\n\r\n      for we heard Mademoiselle still calling \u201cHelp!\u2014help!\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson showered terrible blows on the door, and wept with rage and\r\n\r\n      sobbed with despair and helplessness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It was then that I had an inspiration. \u201cThe assassin must have entered\r\n\r\n      by the window!\u201d I cried;\u2014\u201cI will go to the window!\u201d and I rushed\r\n\r\n      from the pavilion and ran like one out of his mind.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The inspiration was that the window of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d looks out in such\r\n\r\n      a way that the park wall, which abuts on the pavilion, prevented my at\r\n\r\n      once reaching the window. To get up to it one has first to go out of the\r\n\r\n      park. I ran towards the gate and, on my way, met Bernier and his wife, the\r\n\r\n      gate-keepers, who had been attracted by the pistol reports and by our\r\n\r\n      cries. In a few words I told them what had happened, and directed the\r\n\r\n      concierge to join Monsieur Stangerson with all speed, while his wife came\r\n\r\n      with me to open the park gate. Five minutes later she and I were before\r\n\r\n      the window of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The moon was shining brightly and I saw clearly that no one had touched\r\n\r\n      the window. Not only were the bars that protect it intact, but the blinds\r\n\r\n      inside of them were drawn, as I had myself drawn them early in the\r\n\r\n      evening, as I did every day, though Mademoiselle, knowing that I was tired\r\n\r\n      from the heavy work I had been doing, had begged me not to trouble myself,\r\n\r\n      but leave her to do it; and they were just as I had left them, fastened\r\n\r\n      with an iron catch on the inside. The assassin, therefore, could not have\r\n\r\n      passed either in or out that way; but neither could I get in.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It was unfortunate,\u2014enough to turn one\u2019s brain! The door of the\r\n\r\n      room locked on the inside and the blinds on the only window also fastened\r\n\r\n      on the inside; and Mademoiselle still calling for help!\u2014No! she had\r\n\r\n      ceased to call. She was dead, perhaps. But I still heard her father, in\r\n\r\n      the pavilion, trying to break down the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018With the concierge I hurried back to the pavilion. The door, in spite of\r\n\r\n      the furious attempts of Monsieur Stangerson and Bernier to burst it open,\r\n\r\n      was still holding firm; but at length, it gave way before our united\r\n\r\n      efforts,\u2014and then what a sight met our eyes! I should tell you that,\r\n\r\n      behind us, the concierge held the laboratory lamp\u2014a powerful lamp,\r\n\r\n      that lit the whole chamber.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I must also tell you, monsieur, that \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d is a very small\r\n\r\n      room. Mademoiselle had furnished it with a fairly large iron bedstead, a\r\n\r\n      small table, a night-commode; a dressing-table, and two chairs. By the\r\n\r\n      light of the big lamp we saw all at a glance. Mademoiselle, in her\r\n\r\n      night-dress, was lying on the floor in the midst of the greatest disorder.\r\n\r\n      Tables and chairs had been overthrown, showing that there had been a\r\n\r\n      violent struggle. Mademoiselle had certainly been dragged from her bed.\r\n\r\n      She was covered with blood and had terrible marks of finger-nails on her\r\n\r\n      throat,\u2014the flesh of her neck having been almost torn by the nails.\r\n\r\n      From a wound on the right temple a stream of blood had run down and made a\r\n\r\n      little pool on the floor. When Monsieur Stangerson saw his daughter in\r\n\r\n      that state, he threw himself on his knees beside her, uttering a cry of\r\n\r\n      despair. He ascertained that she still breathed. As to us, we searched for\r\n\r\n      the wretch who had tried to kill our mistress, and I swear to you,\r\n\r\n      monsieur, that, if we had found him, it would have gone hard with him!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But how to explain that he was not there, that he had already escaped?\r\n\r\n      It passes all imagination!\u2014Nobody under the bed, nobody behind the\r\n\r\n      furniture!\u2014All that we discovered were traces, blood-stained marks\r\n\r\n      of a man\u2019s large hand on the walls and on the door; a big handkerchief red\r\n\r\n      with blood, without any initials, an old cap, and many fresh footmarks of\r\n\r\n      a man on the floor,\u2014footmarks of a man with large feet whose\r\n\r\n      boot-soles had left a sort of sooty impression. How had this man got away?\r\n\r\n      How had he vanished? Don\u2019t forget, monsieur, that there is no chimney in\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. He could not have escaped by the door, which is narrow,\r\n\r\n      and on the threshold of which the concierge stood with the lamp, while her\r\n\r\n      husband and I searched for him in every corner of the little room, where\r\n\r\n      it is impossible for anyone to hide himself. The door, which had been\r\n\r\n      forced open against the wall, could not conceal anything behind it, as we\r\n\r\n      assured ourselves. By the window, still in every way secured, no flight\r\n\r\n      had been possible. What then?\u2014I began to believe in the Devil.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But we discovered my revolver on the floor!\u2014Yes, my revolver! Oh!\r\n\r\n      that brought me back to the reality! The Devil would not have needed to\r\n\r\n      steal my revolver to kill Mademoiselle. The man who had been there had\r\n\r\n      first gone up to my attic and taken my revolver from the drawer where I\r\n\r\n      kept it. We then ascertained, by counting the cartridges, that the\r\n\r\n      assassin had fired two shots. Ah! it was fortunate for me that Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was in the laboratory when the affair took place and had seen\r\n\r\n      with his own eyes that I was there with him; for otherwise, with this\r\n\r\n      business of my revolver, I don\u2019t know where we should have been,\u2014I\r\n\r\n      should now be under lock and bar. Justice wants no more to send a man to\r\n\r\n      the scaffold!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The editor of the \u201cMatin\u201d added to this interview the following lines:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have, without interrupting him, allowed Daddy Jacques to recount to us\r\n\r\n      roughly all he knows about the crime of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. We have\r\n\r\n      reproduced it in his own words, only sparing the reader the continual\r\n\r\n      lamentations with which he garnished his narrative. It is quite\r\n\r\n      understood, Daddy Jacques, quite understood, that you are very fond of\r\n\r\n      your masters; and you want them to know it, and never cease repeating it\u2014especially\r\n\r\n      since the discovery of your revolver. It is your right, and we see no harm\r\n\r\n      in it. We should have liked to put some further questions to Daddy Jacques\u2014Jacques\u2014Louis\r\n\r\n      Moustier\u2014but the inquiry of the examining magistrate, which is being\r\n\r\n      carried on at the chateau, makes it impossible for us to gain admission at\r\n\r\n      the Glandier; and, as to the oak wood, it is guarded by a wide circle of\r\n\r\n      policemen, who are jealously watching all traces that can lead to the\r\n\r\n      pavilion, and that may perhaps lead to the discovery of the assassin. \u201cWe\r\n\r\n      have also wished to question the concierges, but they are invisible.\r\n\r\n      Finally, we have waited in a roadside inn, not far from the gate of the\r\n\r\n      chateau, for the departure of Monsieur de Marquet, the magistrate of\r\n\r\n      Corbeil. At half-past five we saw him and his clerk and, before he was\r\n\r\n      able to enter his carriage, had an opportunity to ask him the following\r\n\r\n      question:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Can you, Monsieur de Marquet, give us any information as to this affair,\r\n\r\n      without inconvenience to the course of your inquiry?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It is impossible for us to do it,\u2019 replied Monsieur de Marquet. \u2018I can\r\n\r\n      only say that it is the strangest affair I have ever known. The more we\r\n\r\n      think we know something, the further we are from knowing anything!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe asked Monsieur de Marquet to be good enough to explain his last words;\r\n\r\n      and this is what he said,\u2014the importance of which no one will fail\r\n\r\n      to recognise:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If nothing is added to the material facts so far established, I fear\r\n\r\n      that the mystery which surrounds the abominable crime of which\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson has been the victim will never be brought to\r\n\r\n      light; but it is to be hoped, for the sake of our human reason, that the\r\n\r\n      examination of the walls, and of the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\u2014an\r\n\r\n      examination which I shall to-morrow intrust to the builder who constructed\r\n\r\n      the pavilion four years ago\u2014will afford us the proof that may not\r\n\r\n      discourage us. For the problem is this: we know by what way the assassin\r\n\r\n      gained admission,\u2014he entered by the door and hid himself under the\r\n\r\n      bed, awaiting Mademoiselle Stangerson. But how did he leave? How did he\r\n\r\n      escape? If no trap, no secret door, no hiding place, no opening of any\r\n\r\n      sort is found; if the examination of the walls\u2014even to the\r\n\r\n      demolition of the pavilion\u2014does not reveal any passage practicable\u2014not\r\n\r\n      only for a human being, but for any being whatsoever\u2014if the ceiling\r\n\r\n      shows no crack, if the floor hides no underground passage, one must really\r\n\r\n      believe in the Devil, as Daddy Jacques says!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And the anonymous writer in the \u201cMatin\u201d added in this article\u2014which\r\n\r\n      I have selected as the most interesting of all those that were published\r\n\r\n      on the subject of this affair\u2014that the examining magistrate appeared\r\n\r\n      to place a peculiar significance to the last sentence: \u201cOne must really\r\n\r\n      believe in the Devil, as Jacques says.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The article concluded with these lines: \u201cWe wanted to know what Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques meant by the cry of the Bete Du Bon Dieu.\u201d The landlord of the\r\n\r\n      Donjon Inn explained to us that it is the particularly sinister cry which\r\n\r\n      is uttered sometimes at night by the cat of an old woman,\u2014Mother\r\n\r\n      Angenoux, as she is called in the country. Mother Angenoux is a sort of\r\n\r\n      saint, who lives in a hut in the heart of the forest, not far from the\r\n\r\n      grotto of Sainte-Genevieve.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, the Bete Du Bon Dieu, Mother Angenoux, the Devil,\r\n\r\n      Sainte-Genevieve, Daddy Jacques,\u2014here is a well entangled crime\r\n\r\n      which the stroke of a pickaxe in the wall may disentangle for us\r\n\r\n      to-morrow. Let us at least hope that, for the sake of our human reason, as\r\n\r\n      the examining magistrate says. Meanwhile, it is expected that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2014who has not ceased to be delirious and only pronounces\r\n\r\n      one word distinctly, \u2018Murderer! Murderer!\u2019\u2014will not live through the\r\n\r\n      night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      In conclusion, and at a late hour, the same journal announced that the\r\n\r\n      Chief of the Surete had telegraphed to the famous detective, Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan, who had been sent to London for an affair of stolen securities, to\r\n\r\n      return immediately to Paris.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER II. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears for the First Time\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I remember as well as if it had occurred yesterday, the entry of young\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille into my bedroom that morning. It was about eight o\u2019clock and\r\n\r\n      I was still in bed reading the article in the \u201cMatin\u201d relative to the\r\n\r\n      Glandier crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But, before going further, it is time that I present my friend to the\r\n\r\n      reader.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter. At that\r\n\r\n      time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of\r\n\r\n      examining magistrates, when I had gone to get a \u201cpermit to communicate\u201d\r\n\r\n       for the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare. He had, as they say, \u201ca good\r\n\r\n      nut.\u201d He seemed to have taken his head\u2014round as a bullet\u2014out\r\n\r\n      of a box of marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of\r\n\r\n      the press\u2014all determined billiard-players\u2014had given him that\r\n\r\n      nickname, which was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him. He was\r\n\r\n      always as red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How,\r\n\r\n      while still so young\u2014he was only sixteen and a half years old when I\r\n\r\n      saw him for the first time\u2014had he already won his way on the press?\r\n\r\n      That was what everybody who came into contact with him might have asked,\r\n\r\n      if they had not known his history. At the time of the affair of the woman\r\n\r\n      cut in pieces in the Rue Oberskampf\u2014another forgotten story\u2014he\r\n\r\n      had taken to one of the editors of the \u201cEpoque,\u201d\u2014a paper then\r\n\r\n      rivalling the \u201cMatin\u201d for information,\u2014the left foot, which was\r\n\r\n      missing from the basket in which the gruesome remains were discovered. For\r\n\r\n      this left foot the police had been vainly searching for a week, and young\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had found it in a drain where nobody had thought of looking\r\n\r\n      for it. To do that he had dressed himself as an extra sewer-man, one of a\r\n\r\n      number engaged by the administration of the city of Paris, owing to an\r\n\r\n      overflow of the Seine.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When the editor-in-chief was in possession of the precious foot and\r\n\r\n      informed as to the train of intelligent deductions the boy had been led to\r\n\r\n      make, he was divided between the admiration he felt for such detective\r\n\r\n      cunning in a brain of a lad of sixteen years, and delight at being able to\r\n\r\n      exhibit, in the \u201cmorgue window\u201d of his paper, the left foot of the Rue\r\n\r\n      Oberskampf.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis foot,\u201d he cried, \u201cwill make a great headline.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, when he had confided the gruesome packet to the medical lawyer\r\n\r\n      attached to the journal, he asked the lad, who was shortly to become\r\n\r\n      famous as Rouletabille, what he would expect to earn as a general reporter\r\n\r\n      on the \u201cEpoque\u201d?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwo hundred francs a month,\u201d the youngster replied modestly, hardly able\r\n\r\n      to breathe from surprise at the proposal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou shall have two hundred and fifty,\u201d said the editor-in-chief; \u201conly\r\n\r\n      you must tell everybody that you have been engaged on the paper for a\r\n\r\n      month. Let it be quite understood that it was not you but the \u2018Epoque\u2019\r\n\r\n      that discovered the left foot of the Rue Oberskampf. Here, my young\r\n\r\n      friend, the man is nothing, the paper everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having said this, he begged the new reporter to retire, but before the\r\n\r\n      youth had reached the door he called him back to ask his name. The other\r\n\r\n      replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJoseph Josephine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s not a name,\u201d said the editor-in-chief, \u201cbut since you will not be\r\n\r\n      required to sign what you write it is of no consequence.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The boy-faced reporter speedily made himself many friends, for he was\r\n\r\n      serviceable and gifted with a good humour that enchanted the most\r\n\r\n      severe-tempered and disarmed the most zealous of his companions. At the\r\n\r\n      Bar cafe, where the reporters assembled before going to any of the courts,\r\n\r\n      or to the Prefecture, in search of their news of crime, he began to win a\r\n\r\n      reputation as an unraveller of intricate and obscure affairs which found\r\n\r\n      its way to the office of the Chief of the Surete. When a case was worth\r\n\r\n      the trouble and Rouletabille\u2014he had already been given his nickname\u2014had\r\n\r\n      been started on the scent by his editor-in-chief, he often got the better\r\n\r\n      of the most famous detective.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was at the Bar cafe that I became intimately acquainted with him.\r\n\r\n      Criminal lawyers and journalists are not enemies, the former need\r\n\r\n      advertisement, the latter information. We chatted together, and I soon\r\n\r\n      warmed towards him. His intelligence was so keen, and so original!\u2014and\r\n\r\n      he had a quality of thought such as I have never found in any other\r\n\r\n      person.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Some time after this I was put in charge of the law news of the \u201cCri du\r\n\r\n      Boulevard.\u201d My entry into journalism could not but strengthen the ties\r\n\r\n      which united me to Rouletabille. After a while, my new friend being\r\n\r\n      allowed to carry out an idea of a judicial correspondence column, which he\r\n\r\n      was allowed to sign \u201cBusiness,\u201d in the \u201cEpoque,\u201d I was often able to\r\n\r\n      furnish him with the legal information of which he stood in need.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Nearly two years passed in this way, and the better I knew him, the more I\r\n\r\n      learned to love him; for, in spite of his careless extravagance, I had\r\n\r\n      discovered in him what was, considering his age, an extraordinary\r\n\r\n      seriousness of mind. Accustomed as I was to seeing him gay and, indeed,\r\n\r\n      often too gay, I would many times find him plunged in the deepest\r\n\r\n      melancholy. I tried then to question him as to the cause of this change of\r\n\r\n      humour, but each time he laughed and made me no answer. One day, having\r\n\r\n      questioned him about his parents, of whom he never spoke, he left me,\r\n\r\n      pretending not to have heard what I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      While things were in this state between us, the famous case of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room took place. It was this case which was to rank him as the leading\r\n\r\n      newspaper reporter, and to obtain for him the reputation of being the\r\n\r\n      greatest detective in the world. It should not surprise us to find in the\r\n\r\n      one man the perfection of two such lines of activity if we remember that\r\n\r\n      the daily press was already beginning to transform itself and to become\r\n\r\n      what it is to-day\u2014the gazette of crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Morose-minded people may complain of this; for myself I regard it a matter\r\n\r\n      for congratulation. We can never have too many arms, public or private,\r\n\r\n      against the criminal. To this some people may answer that, by continually\r\n\r\n      publishing the details of crimes, the press ends by encouraging their\r\n\r\n      commission. But then, with some people we can never do right.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, as I have said, entered my room that morning of the 26th of\r\n\r\n      October, 1892. He was looking redder than usual, and his eyes were bulging\r\n\r\n      out of his head, as the phrase is, and altogether he appeared to be in a\r\n\r\n      state of extreme excitement. He waved the \u201cMatin\u201d with a trembling hand,\r\n\r\n      and cried:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, my dear Sainclair,\u2014have you read it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Glandier crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d!\u2014What do you think of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think that it must have been the Devil or the Bete du Bon Dieu that\r\n\r\n      committed the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe serious!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I don\u2019t much believe in murderers* who make their escape through\r\n\r\n      walls of solid brick. I think Daddy Jacques did wrong to leave behind him\r\n\r\n      the weapon with which the crime was committed and, as he occupied the\r\n\r\n      attic immediately above Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room, the builder\u2019s job\r\n\r\n      ordered by the examining magistrate will give us the key of the enigma and\r\n\r\n      it will not be long before we learn by what natural trap, or by what\r\n\r\n      secret door, the old fellow was able to slip in and out, and return\r\n\r\n      immediately to the laboratory to Monsieur Stangerson, without his absence\r\n\r\n      being noticed. That, of course, is only an hypothesis.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille sat down in an armchair, lit his pipe, which he was never\r\n\r\n      without, smoked for a few minutes in silence\u2014no doubt to calm the\r\n\r\n      excitement which, visibly, dominated him\u2014and then replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYoung man,\u201d he said, in a tone the sad irony of which I will not attempt\r\n\r\n      to render, \u201cyoung man, you are a lawyer and I doubt not your ability to\r\n\r\n      save the guilty from conviction; but if you were a magistrate on the\r\n\r\n      bench, how easy it would be for you to condemn innocent persons!\u2014You\r\n\r\n      are really gifted, young man!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He continued to smoke energetically, and then went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo trap will be found, and the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d will become\r\n\r\n      more and more mysterious. That\u2019s why it interests me. The examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate is right; nothing stranger than this crime has ever been\r\n\r\n      known.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you any idea of the way by which the murderer escaped?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone,\u201d replied Rouletabille\u2014\u201cnone, for the present. But I have an\r\n\r\n      idea as to the revolver; the murderer did not use it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood Heavens! By whom, then, was it used?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy\u2014by Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u2014or rather, I have never understood,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs there nothing in this article in the \u2018Matin\u2019 by which you were\r\n\r\n      particularly struck?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing,\u2014I have found the whole of the story it tells equally\r\n\r\n      strange.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, but\u2014the locked door\u2014with the key on the inside?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s the only perfectly natural thing in the whole article.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cReally!\u2014And the bolt?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe bolt?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, the bolt\u2014also inside the room\u2014a still further protection\r\n\r\n      against entry? Mademoiselle Stangerson took quite extraordinary\r\n\r\n      precautions! It is clear to me that she feared someone. That was why she\r\n\r\n      took such precautions\u2014even Daddy Jacques\u2019s revolver\u2014without\r\n\r\n      telling him of it. No doubt she didn\u2019t wish to alarm anybody, and least of\r\n\r\n      all, her father. What she dreaded took place, and she defended herself.\r\n\r\n      There was a struggle, and she used the revolver skilfully enough to wound\r\n\r\n      the assassin in the hand\u2014which explains the impression on the wall\r\n\r\n      and on the door of the large, blood-stained hand of the man who was\r\n\r\n      searching for a means of exit from the chamber. But she didn\u2019t fire soon\r\n\r\n      enough to avoid the terrible blow on the right temple.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen the wound on the temple was not done with the revolver?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe paper doesn\u2019t say it was, and I don\u2019t think it was; because logically\r\n\r\n      it appears to me that the revolver was used by Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      against the assassin. Now, what weapon did the murderer use? The blow on\r\n\r\n      the temple seems to show that the murderer wished to stun Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson,\u2014after he had unsuccessfully tried to strangle her. He\r\n\r\n      must have known that the attic was inhabited by Daddy Jacques, and that\r\n\r\n      was one of the reasons, I think, why he must have used a quiet weapon,\u2014a\r\n\r\n      life-preserver, or a hammer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll that doesn\u2019t explain how the murderer got out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d I\r\n\r\n      observed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently,\u201d replied Rouletabille, rising, \u201cand that is what has to be\r\n\r\n      explained. I am going to the Chateau du Glandier, and have come to see\r\n\r\n      whether you will go with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI?\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, my boy. I want you. The \u2018Epoque\u2019 has definitely entrusted this case\r\n\r\n      to me, and I must clear it up as quickly as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut in what way can I be of any use to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Robert Darzac is at the Chateau du Glandier.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s true. His despair must be boundless.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI must have a talk with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille said it in a tone that surprised me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it because\u2014you think there is something to be got out of him?\u201d I\r\n\r\n      asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That was all he would say. He retired to my sitting-room, begging me to\r\n\r\n      dress quickly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I knew Monsieur Robert Darzac from having been of great service to him in\r\n\r\n      a civil action, while I was acting as secretary to Maitre Barbet Delatour.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was at that time about forty years of age, was\r\n\r\n      a professor of physics at the Sorbonne. He was intimately acquainted with\r\n\r\n      the Stangersons, and, after an assiduous seven years\u2019 courtship of the\r\n\r\n      daughter, had been on the point of marrying her. In spite of the fact that\r\n\r\n      she has become, as the phrase goes, \u201ca person of a certain age,\u201d she was\r\n\r\n      still remarkably good-looking. While I was dressing I called out to\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, who was impatiently moving about my sitting-room:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you any idea as to the murderer\u2019s station in life?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he replied; \u201cI think if he isn\u2019t a man in society, he is, at least,\r\n\r\n      a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again, is only an\r\n\r\n      impression.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat has led you to form it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u2014the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks of the\r\n\r\n      rough boots on the floor,\u201d he replied.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI understand,\u201d I said; \u201cmurderers don\u2019t leave traces behind them which\r\n\r\n      tell the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sainclair,\u201d concluded\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER III. \u201cA Man Has Passed Like a Shadow Through the Blinds\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Half an hour later Rouletabille and I were on the platform of the Orleans\r\n\r\n      station, awaiting the departure of the train which was to take us to\r\n\r\n      Epinay-sur-Orge.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the platform we found Monsieur de Marquet and his Registrar, who\r\n\r\n      represented the Judicial Court of Corbeil. Monsieur Marquet had spent the\r\n\r\n      night in Paris, attending the final rehearsal, at the Scala, of a little\r\n\r\n      play of which he was the unknown author, signing himself simply \u201cCastigat\r\n\r\n      Ridendo.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet was beginning to be a \u201cnoble old gentleman.\u201d Generally\r\n\r\n      he was extremely polite and full of gay humour, and in all his life had\r\n\r\n      had but one passion,\u2014that of dramatic art. Throughout his\r\n\r\n      magisterial career he was interested solely in cases capable of furnishing\r\n\r\n      him with something in the nature of a drama. Though he might very well\r\n\r\n      have aspired to the highest judicial positions, he had never really worked\r\n\r\n      for anything but to win a success at the romantic Porte-Saint-Martin, or\r\n\r\n      at the sombre Odeon.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Because of the mystery which shrouded it, the case of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n      certain to fascinate so theatrical a mind. It interested him enormously,\r\n\r\n      and he threw himself into it, less as a magistrate eager to know the\r\n\r\n      truth, than as an amateur of dramatic embroglios, tending wholly to\r\n\r\n      mystery and intrigue, who dreads nothing so much as the explanatory final\r\n\r\n      act.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      So that, at the moment of meeting him, I heard Monsieur de Marquet say to\r\n\r\n      the Registrar with a sigh:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope, my dear Monsieur Maleine, this builder with his pickaxe will not\r\n\r\n      destroy so fine a mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave no fear,\u201d replied Monsieur Maleine, \u201chis pickaxe may demolish the\r\n\r\n      pavilion, perhaps, but it will leave our case intact. I have sounded the\r\n\r\n      walls and examined the ceiling and floor and I know all about it. I am not\r\n\r\n      to be deceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having thus reassured his chief, Monsieur Maleine, with a discreet\r\n\r\n      movement of the head, drew Monsieur de Marquet\u2019s attention to us. The face\r\n\r\n      of that gentleman clouded, and, as he saw Rouletabille approaching, hat in\r\n\r\n      hand, he sprang into one of the empty carriages saying, half aloud to his\r\n\r\n      Registrar, as he did so, \u201cAbove all, no journalists!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Maleine replied in the same tone, \u201cI understand!\u201d and then tried\r\n\r\n      to prevent Rouletabille from entering the same compartment with the\r\n\r\n      examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcuse me, gentlemen,\u2014this compartment is reserved.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am a journalist, Monsieur, engaged on the \u2018Epoque,\u2019\u201d said my young\r\n\r\n      friend with a great show of gesture and politeness, \u201cand I have a word or\r\n\r\n      two to say to Monsieur de Marquet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur is very much engaged with the inquiry he has in hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! his inquiry, pray believe me, is absolutely a matter of indifference\r\n\r\n      to me. I am no scavenger of odds and ends,\u201d he went on, with infinite\r\n\r\n      contempt in his lower lip, \u201cI am a theatrical reporter; and this evening I\r\n\r\n      shall have to give a little account of the play at the Scala.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGet in, sir, please,\u201d said the Registrar.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was already in the compartment. I went in after him and\r\n\r\n      seated myself by his side. The Registrar followed and closed the carriage\r\n\r\n      door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet looked at him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, sir,\u201d Rouletabille began, \u201cYou must not be angry with Monsieur de\r\n\r\n      Maleine. It is not with Monsieur de Marquet that I desire to have the\r\n\r\n      honour of speaking, but with Monsieur \u2018Castigat Ridendo.\u2019 Permit me to\r\n\r\n      congratulate you\u2014personally, as well as the writer for the\r\n\r\n      \u2018Epoque.\u2019\u201d And Rouletabille, having first introduced me, introduced\r\n\r\n      himself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet, with a nervous gesture, caressed his beard into a\r\n\r\n      point, and explained to Rouletabille, in a few words, that he was too\r\n\r\n      modest an author to desire that the veil of his pseudonym should be\r\n\r\n      publicly raised, and that he hoped the enthusiasm of the journalist for\r\n\r\n      the dramatist\u2019s work would not lead him to tell the public that Monsieur\r\n\r\n      \u201cCastigat Ridendo\u201d and the examining magistrate of Corbeil were one and\r\n\r\n      the same person.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe work of the dramatic author may interfere,\u201d he said, after a slight\r\n\r\n      hesitation, \u201cwith that of the magistrate, especially in a province where\r\n\r\n      one\u2019s labours are little more than routine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, you may rely on my discretion!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The train was in motion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have started!\u201d said the examining magistrate, surprised at seeing us\r\n\r\n      still in the carriage.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u2014truth has started,\u201d said Rouletabile, smiling\r\n\r\n      amiably,\u2014\u201con its way to the Chateau du Glandier. A fine case,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet,\u2014a fine case!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn obscure\u2014incredible, unfathomable, inexplicable affair\u2014and\r\n\r\n      there is only one thing I fear, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u2014that the\r\n\r\n      journalists will be trying to explain it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend felt this a rap on his knuckles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he said simply, \u201cthat is to be feared. They meddle in everything.\r\n\r\n      As for my interest, monsieur, I only referred to it by mere chance,\u2014the\r\n\r\n      mere chance of finding myself in the same train with you, and in the same\r\n\r\n      compartment of the same carriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere are you going, then?\u201d asked Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo the Chateau du Glandier,\u201d replied Rouletabille, without turning.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll not get in, Monsieur Rouletabille!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWill you prevent me?\u201d said my friend, already prepared to fight.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot I!\u2014I like the press and journalists too well to be in any way\r\n\r\n      disagreeable to them; but Monsieur Stangerson has given orders for his\r\n\r\n      door to be closed against everybody, and it is well guarded. Not a\r\n\r\n      journalist was able to pass through the gate of the Glandier yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet compressed his lips and seemed ready to relapse into\r\n\r\n      obstinate silence. He only relaxed a little when Rouletabille no longer\r\n\r\n      left him in ignorance of the fact that we were going to the Glandier for\r\n\r\n      the purpose of shaking hands with an \u201cold and intimate friend,\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac\u2014a man whom Rouletabille had perhaps seen once in his\r\n\r\n      life.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPoor Robert!\u201d continued the young reporter, \u201cthis dreadful affair may be\r\n\r\n      his death,\u2014he is so deeply in love with Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis sufferings are truly painful to witness,\u201d escaped like a regret from\r\n\r\n      the lips of Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s life will be saved.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet us hope so. Her father told me yesterday that, if she does not\r\n\r\n      recover, it will not be long before he joins her in the grave. What an\r\n\r\n      incalculable loss to science his death would be!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe wound on her temple is serious, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently; but, by a wonderful chance, it has not proved mortal. The blow\r\n\r\n      was given with great force.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen it was not with the revolver she was wounded,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      glancing at me in triumph.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet appeared greatly embarrassed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything\u2014I don\u2019t want to say anything\u2014I will not\r\n\r\n      say anything,\u201d he said. And he turned towards his Registrar as if he no\r\n\r\n      longer knew us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But Rouletabille was not to be so easily shaken off. He moved nearer to\r\n\r\n      the examining magistrate and, drawing a copy of the \u201cMatin\u201d from his\r\n\r\n      pocket, he showed it to him and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is one thing, Monsieur, which I may enquire of you without\r\n\r\n      committing an indiscretion. You have, of course, seen the account given in\r\n\r\n      the \u2018Matin\u2019? It is absurd, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot in the slightest, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d has but one barred window\u2014the bars of which\r\n\r\n      have not been moved\u2014and only one door, which had to be broken open\u2014and\r\n\r\n      the assassin was not found!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s so, monsieur,\u2014that\u2019s so. That\u2019s how the matter stands.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille said no more but plunged into thought. A quarter of an hour\r\n\r\n      thus passed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Coming back to himself again he said, addressing the magistrate:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow did Mademoiselle Stangerson wear her hair on that evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a very important point,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cHer hair was done up\r\n\r\n      in bands, wasn\u2019t it? I feel sure that on that evening, the evening of the\r\n\r\n      crime, she had her hair arranged in bands.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you are mistaken, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d replied the magistrate;\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson that evening had her hair drawn up in a knot on\r\n\r\n      the top of her head,\u2014her usual way of arranging it\u2014her\r\n\r\n      forehead completely uncovered. I can assure you, for we have carefully\r\n\r\n      examined the wound. There was no blood on the hair, and the arrangement of\r\n\r\n      it has not been disturbed since the crime was committed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are sure! You are sure that, on the night of the crime, she had not\r\n\r\n      her hair in bands?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite sure,\u201d the magistrate continued, smiling, \u201cbecause I remember the\r\n\r\n      Doctor saying to me, while he was examining the wound, \u2018It is a great pity\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson was in the habit of drawing her hair back from her\r\n\r\n      forehead. If she had worn it in bands, the blow she received on the temple\r\n\r\n      would have been weakened.\u2019 It seems strange to me that you should attach\r\n\r\n      so much importance to this point.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! if she had not her hair in bands, I give it up,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      with a despairing gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd was the wound on her temple a bad one?\u201d he asked presently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTerrible.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith what weapon was it made?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is a secret of the investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you found the weapon\u2014whatever it was?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The magistrate did not answer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the wound in the throat?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the examining magistrate readily confirmed the decision of the doctor\r\n\r\n      that, if the murderer had pressed her throat a few seconds longer,\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson would have died of strangulation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe affair as reported in the \u2018Matin,\u2019\u201d said Rouletabille eagerly, \u201cseems\r\n\r\n      to me more and more inexplicable. Can you tell me, Monsieur, how many\r\n\r\n      openings there are in the pavilion? I mean doors and windows.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are five,\u201d replied Monsieur de Marquet, after having coughed once\r\n\r\n      or twice, but no longer resisting the desire he felt to talk of the whole\r\n\r\n      of the incredible mystery of the affair he was investigating. \u201cThere are\r\n\r\n      five, of which the door of the vestibule is the only entrance to the\r\n\r\n      pavilion,\u2014a door always automatically closed, which cannot be\r\n\r\n      opened, either from the outer or inside, except with the two special keys\r\n\r\n      which are never out of the possession of either Daddy Jacques or Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. Mademoiselle Stangerson had no need for one, since Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques lodged in the pavilion and because, during the daytime, she never\r\n\r\n      left her father. When they, all four, rushed into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, after\r\n\r\n      breaking open the door of the laboratory, the door in the vestibule\r\n\r\n      remained closed as usual and, of the two keys for opening it, Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques had one in his pocket, and Monsieur Stangerson the other. As to\r\n\r\n      the windows of the pavilion, there are four; the one window of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room and those of the laboratory looking out on to the country; the window\r\n\r\n      in the vestibule looking into the park.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is by that window that he escaped from the pavilion!\u201d cried\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d demanded Monsieur de Marquet, fixing a strange\r\n\r\n      look on my young friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe\u2019ll see later how he got away from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d replied\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, \u201cbut he must have left the pavilion by the vestibule\r\n\r\n      window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOnce more,\u2014how do you know that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow? Oh, the thing is simple enough! As soon as he found he could not\r\n\r\n      escape by the door of the pavilion his only way out was by the window in\r\n\r\n      the vestibule, unless he could pass through a grated window. The window of\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d is secured by iron bars, because it looks out upon the\r\n\r\n      open country; the two windows of the laboratory have to be protected in\r\n\r\n      like manner for the same reason. As the murderer got away, I conceive that\r\n\r\n      he found a window that was not barred,\u2014that of the vestibule, which\r\n\r\n      opens on to the park,\u2014that is to say, into the interior of the\r\n\r\n      estate. There\u2019s not much magic in all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet, \u201cbut what you have not guessed is that\r\n\r\n      this single window in the vestibule, though it has no iron bars, has solid\r\n\r\n      iron blinds. Now these iron blinds have remained fastened by their iron\r\n\r\n      latch; and yet we have proof that the murderer made his escape from the\r\n\r\n      pavilion by that window! Traces of blood on the inside wall and on the\r\n\r\n      blinds as well as on the floor, and footmarks, of which I have taken the\r\n\r\n      measurements, attest the fact that the murderer made his escape that way.\r\n\r\n      But then, how did he do it, seeing that the blinds remained fastened on\r\n\r\n      the inside? He passed through them like a shadow. But what is more\r\n\r\n      bewildering than all is that it is impossible to form any idea as to how\r\n\r\n      the murderer got out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, or how he got across the\r\n\r\n      laboratory to reach the vestibule! Ah, yes, Monsieur Rouletabille, it is\r\n\r\n      altogether as you said, a fine case, the key to which will not be\r\n\r\n      discovered for a long time, I hope.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou hope, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet corrected himself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not hope so,\u2014I think so.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCould that window have been closed and refastened after the flight of the\r\n\r\n      assassin?\u201d asked Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is what occurred to me for a moment; but it would imply an\r\n\r\n      accomplice or accomplices,\u2014and I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      After a short silence he added:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh\u2014if Mademoiselle Stangerson were only well enough to-day to be\r\n\r\n      questioned!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille following up his thought, asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the attic?\u2014There must be some opening to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; there is a window, or rather skylight, in it, which, as it looks out\r\n\r\n      towards the country, Monsieur Stangerson has had barred, like the rest of\r\n\r\n      the windows. These bars, as in the other windows, have remained intact,\r\n\r\n      and the blinds, which naturally open inwards, have not been unfastened.\r\n\r\n      For the rest, we have not discovered anything to lead us to suspect that\r\n\r\n      the murderer had passed through the attic.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems clear to you, then, Monsieur, that the murderer escaped\u2014nobody\r\n\r\n      knows how\u2014by the window in the vestibule?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything goes to prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think so, too,\u201d confessed Rouletabille gravely.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      After a brief silence, he continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you have not found any traces of the murderer in the attic, such as\r\n\r\n      the dirty footmarks similar to those on the floor of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, you\r\n\r\n      must come to the conclusion that it was not he who stole Daddy Jacques\u2019s\r\n\r\n      revolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are no footmarks in the attic other than those of Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      himself,\u201d said the magistrate with a significant turn of his head. Then,\r\n\r\n      after an apparent decision, he added: \u201cDaddy Jacques was with Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson in the laboratory\u2014and it was lucky for him he was.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen what part did his revolver play in the tragedy?\u2014It seems very\r\n\r\n      clear that this weapon did less harm to Mademoiselle Stangerson than it\r\n\r\n      did to the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The magistrate made no reply to this question, which doubtless embarrassed\r\n\r\n      him. \u201cMonsieur Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201ctells us that the two bullets have\r\n\r\n      been found in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, one embedded in the wall stained with the\r\n\r\n      impression of a red hand\u2014a man\u2019s large hand\u2014and the other in\r\n\r\n      the ceiling.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! oh! in the ceiling!\u201d muttered Rouletabille. \u201cIn the ceiling! That\u2019s\r\n\r\n      very curious!\u2014In the ceiling!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He puffed awhile in silence at his pipe, enveloping himself in the smoke.\r\n\r\n      When we reached Savigny-sur-Orge, I had to tap him on the shoulder to\r\n\r\n      arouse him from his dream and come out on to the platform of the station.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      There, the magistrate and his Registrar bowed to us, and by rapidly\r\n\r\n      getting into a cab that was awaiting them, made us understand that they\r\n\r\n      had seen enough of us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow long will it take to walk to the Chateau du Glandier?\u201d Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      asked one of the railway porters.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn hour and a half or an hour and three quarters\u2014easy walking,\u201d the\r\n\r\n      man replied.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked up at the sky and, no doubt, finding its appearance\r\n\r\n      satisfactory, took my arm and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome on!\u2014I need a walk.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre things getting less entangled?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot a bit of it!\u201d he said, \u201cmore entangled than ever! It\u2019s true, I have\r\n\r\n      an idea\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it is just at present\u2014it\u2019s an idea involving\r\n\r\n      the life or death of two persons at least.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think there were accomplices?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We fell into silence. Presently he went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was a bit of luck, our falling in with that examining magistrate and\r\n\r\n      his Registrar, eh? What did I tell you about that revolver?\u201d His head was\r\n\r\n      bent down, he had his hands in his pockets, and he was whistling. After a\r\n\r\n      while I heard him murmur:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPoor woman!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs it Mademoiselle Stangerson you are pitying?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; she\u2019s a noble woman and worthy of being pitied!\u2014a woman of a\r\n\r\n      great, a very great character\u2014I imagine\u2014I imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know her then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot at all. I have never seen her.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, then, do you say that she is a woman of great character?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause she bravely faced the murderer; because she courageously defended\r\n\r\n      herself\u2014and, above all, because of the bullet in the ceiling.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I looked at Rouletabille and inwardly wondered whether he was not mocking\r\n\r\n      me, or whether he had not suddenly gone out of his senses. But I saw that\r\n\r\n      he had never been less inclined to laugh, and the brightness of his keenly\r\n\r\n      intelligent eyes assured me that he retained all his reason. Then, too, I\r\n\r\n      was used to his broken way of talking, which only left me puzzled as to\r\n\r\n      his meaning, till, with a very few clear, rapidly uttered words, he would\r\n\r\n      make the drift of his ideas clear to me, and I saw that what he had\r\n\r\n      previously said, and which had appeared to me void of meaning, was so\r\n\r\n      thoroughly logical that I could not understand how it was I had not\r\n\r\n      understood him sooner.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER IV. \u201cIn the Bosom of Wild Nature\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Chateau du Glandier is one of the oldest chateaux in the Ile de\r\n\r\n      France, where so many building remains of the feudal period are still\r\n\r\n      standing. Built originally in the heart of the forest, in the reign of\r\n\r\n      Philip le Bel, it now could be seen a few hundred yards from the road\r\n\r\n      leading from the village of Sainte-Genevieve to Monthery. A mass of\r\n\r\n      inharmonious structures, it is dominated by a donjon. When the visitor has\r\n\r\n      mounted the crumbling steps of this ancient donjon, he reaches a little\r\n\r\n      plateau where, in the seventeenth century, Georges Philibert de Sequigny,\r\n\r\n      Lord of the Glandier, Maisons-Neuves and other places, built the existing\r\n\r\n      town in an abominably rococo style of architecture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was in this place, seemingly belonging entirely to the past, that\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson and his daughter installed themselves to lay the\r\n\r\n      foundations for the science of the future. Its solitude, in the depths of\r\n\r\n      woods, was what, more than all, had pleased them. They would have none to\r\n\r\n      witness their labours and intrude on their hopes, but the aged stones and\r\n\r\n      grand old oaks. The Glandier\u2014ancient Glandierum\u2014was so called\r\n\r\n      from the quantity of glands (acorns) which, in all times, had been\r\n\r\n      gathered in that neighbourhood. This land, of present mournful interest,\r\n\r\n      had fallen back, owing to the negligence or abandonment of its owners,\r\n\r\n      into the wild character of primitive nature. The buildings alone, which\r\n\r\n      were hidden there, had preserved traces of their strange metamorphoses.\r\n\r\n      Every age had left on them its imprint; a bit of architecture with which\r\n\r\n      was bound up the remembrance of some terrible event, some bloody\r\n\r\n      adventure. Such was the chateau in which science had taken refuge\u2014a\r\n\r\n      place seemingly designed to be the theatre of mysteries, terror, and\r\n\r\n      death.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having explained so far, I cannot refrain from making one further\r\n\r\n      reflection. If I have lingered a little over this description of the\r\n\r\n      Glandier, it is not because I have reached the right moment for creating\r\n\r\n      the necessary atmosphere for the unfolding of the tragedy before the eyes\r\n\r\n      of the reader. Indeed, in all this matter, my first care will be to be as\r\n\r\n      simple as is possible. I have no ambition to be an author. An author is\r\n\r\n      always something of a romancer, and God knows, the mystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room is quite full enough of real tragic horror to require no aid from\r\n\r\n      literary effects. I am, and only desire to be, a faithful \u201creporter.\u201d My\r\n\r\n      duty is to report the event; and I place the event in its frame\u2014that\r\n\r\n      is all. It is only natural that you should know where the things happened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I return to Monsieur Stangerson. When he bought the estate, fifteen years\r\n\r\n      before the tragedy with which we are engaged occurred, the Chateau du\r\n\r\n      Glandier had for a long time been unoccupied. Another old chateau in the\r\n\r\n      neighbourhood, built in the fourteenth century by Jean de Belmont, was\r\n\r\n      also abandoned, so that that part of the country was very little\r\n\r\n      inhabited. Some small houses on the side of the road leading to Corbeil,\r\n\r\n      an inn, called the \u201cAuberge du Donjon,\u201d which offered passing hospitality\r\n\r\n      to waggoners; these were about all to represent civilisation in this\r\n\r\n      out-of-the-way part of the country, but a few leagues from the capital.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But this deserted condition of the place had been the determining reason\r\n\r\n      for the choice made by Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was already celebrated. He had returned from America, where his\r\n\r\n      works had made a great stir. The book which he had published at\r\n\r\n      Philadelphia, on the \u201cDissociation of Matter by Electric Action,\u201d had\r\n\r\n      aroused opposition throughout the whole scientific world. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was a Frenchman, but of American origin. Important matters\r\n\r\n      relating to a legacy had kept him for several years in the United States,\r\n\r\n      where he had continued the work begun by him in France, whither he had\r\n\r\n      returned in possession of a large fortune. This fortune was a great boon\r\n\r\n      to him; for, though he might have made millions of dollars by exploiting\r\n\r\n      two or three of his chemical discoveries relative to new processes of\r\n\r\n      dyeing, it was always repugnant to him to use for his own private gain the\r\n\r\n      wonderful gift of invention he had received from nature. He considered he\r\n\r\n      owed it to mankind, and all that his genius brought into the world went,\r\n\r\n      by this philosophical view of his duty, into the public lap.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      If he did not try to conceal his satisfaction at coming into possession of\r\n\r\n      this fortune, which enabled him to give himself up to his passion for pure\r\n\r\n      science, he had equally to rejoice, it seemed to him, for another cause.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson was, at the time when her father returned from\r\n\r\n      America and bought the Glandier estate, twenty years of age. She was\r\n\r\n      exceedingly pretty, having at once the Parisian grace of her mother, who\r\n\r\n      had died in giving her birth, and all the splendour, all the riches of the\r\n\r\n      young American blood of her parental grandfather, William Stangerson. A\r\n\r\n      citizen of Philadelphia, William Stangerson had been obliged to become\r\n\r\n      naturalised in obedience to family exigencies at the time of his marriage\r\n\r\n      with a French lady, she who was to be the mother of the illustrious\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. In that way the professor\u2019s French nationality is accounted\r\n\r\n      for.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Twenty years of age, a charming blonde, with blue eyes, milk-white\r\n\r\n      complexion, and radiant with divine health, Mathilde Stangerson was one of\r\n\r\n      the most beautiful marriageable girls in either the old or the new world.\r\n\r\n      It was her father\u2019s duty, in spite of the inevitable pain which a\r\n\r\n      separation from her would cause him, to think of her marriage; and he was\r\n\r\n      fully prepared for it. Nevertheless, he buried himself and his child at\r\n\r\n      the Glandier at the moment when his friends were expecting him to bring\r\n\r\n      her out into society. Some of them expressed their astonishment, and to\r\n\r\n      their questions he answered: \u201cIt is my daughter\u2019s wish. I can refuse her\r\n\r\n      nothing. She has chosen the Glandier.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Interrogated in her turn, the young girl replied calmly: \u201cWhere could we\r\n\r\n      work better than in this solitude?\u201d For Mademoiselle Stangerson had\r\n\r\n      already begun to collaborate with her father in his work. It could not at\r\n\r\n      the time be imagined that her passion for science would lead her so far as\r\n\r\n      to refuse all the suitors who presented themselves to her for over fifteen\r\n\r\n      years. So secluded was the life led by the two, father and daughter, that\r\n\r\n      they showed themselves only at a few official receptions and, at certain\r\n\r\n      times in the year, in two or three friendly drawing-rooms, where the fame\r\n\r\n      of the professor and the beauty of Mathilde made a sensation. The young\r\n\r\n      girl\u2019s extreme reserve did not at first discourage suitors; but at the end\r\n\r\n      of a few years, they tired of their quest.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      One alone persisted with tender tenacity and deserved the name of \u201ceternal\r\n\r\n      fiance,\u201d a name he accepted with melancholy resignation; that was Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac. Mademoiselle Stangerson was now no longer young, and it\r\n\r\n      seemed that, having found no reason for marrying at five-and-thirty, she\r\n\r\n      would never find one. But such an argument evidently found no acceptance\r\n\r\n      with Monsieur Robert Darzac. He continued to pay his court\u2014if the\r\n\r\n      delicate and tender attention with which he ceaselessly surrounded this\r\n\r\n      woman of five-and-thirty could be called courtship\u2014in face of her\r\n\r\n      declared intention never to marry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly, some weeks before the events with which we are occupied, a\r\n\r\n      report\u2014to which nobody attached any importance, so incredible did it\r\n\r\n      sound\u2014was spread about Paris, that Mademoiselle Stangerson had at\r\n\r\n      last consented to \u201ccrown\u201d the inextinguishable flame of Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac! It needed that Monsieur Robert Darzac himself should not deny this\r\n\r\n      matrimonial rumour to give it an appearance of truth, so unlikely did it\r\n\r\n      seem to be well founded. One day, however, Monsieur Stangerson, as he was\r\n\r\n      leaving the Academy of Science, announced that the marriage of his\r\n\r\n      daughter and Monsieur Robert Darzac would be celebrated in the privacy of\r\n\r\n      the Chateau du Glandier, as soon as he and his daughter had put the\r\n\r\n      finishing touches to their report summing up their labours on the\r\n\r\n      \u201cDissociation of Matter.\u201d The new household would install itself in the\r\n\r\n      Glandier, and the son-in-law would lend his assistance in the work to\r\n\r\n      which the father and daughter had dedicated their lives.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The scientific world had barely had time to recover from the effect of\r\n\r\n      this news, when it learned of the attempted assassination of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      under the extraordinary conditions which we have detailed and which our\r\n\r\n      visit to the chateau was to enable us to ascertain with yet greater\r\n\r\n      precision. I have not hesitated to furnish the reader with all these\r\n\r\n      retrospective details, known to me through my business relations with\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac. On crossing the threshold of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d he\r\n\r\n      was as well posted as I was.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER V. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Makes a Remark to Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac Which Produces Its Little Effect\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and I had been walking for several minutes, by the side of a\r\n\r\n      long wall bounding the vast property of Monsieur Stangerson and had\r\n\r\n      already come within sight of the entrance gate, when our attention was\r\n\r\n      drawn to an individual who, half bent to the ground, seemed to be so\r\n\r\n      completely absorbed in what he was doing as not to have seen us coming\r\n\r\n      towards him. At one time he stooped so low as almost to touch the ground;\r\n\r\n      at another he drew himself up and attentively examined the wall; then he\r\n\r\n      looked into the palm of one of his hands, and walked away with rapid\r\n\r\n      strides. Finally he set off running, still looking into the palm of his\r\n\r\n      hand. Rouletabille had brought me to a standstill by a gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHush! Frederic Larsan is at work! Don\u2019t let us disturb him!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had a great admiration for the celebrated detective. I had\r\n\r\n      never before seen him, but I knew him well by reputation. At that time,\r\n\r\n      before Rouletabille had given proof of his unique talent, Larsan was\r\n\r\n      reputed as the most skilful unraveller of the most mysterious and\r\n\r\n      complicated crimes. His reputation was world-wide, and the police of\r\n\r\n      London, and even of America, often called him in to their aid when their\r\n\r\n      own national inspectors and detectives found themselves at the end of\r\n\r\n      their wits and resources.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      No one was astonished, then, that the head of the Surete had, at the\r\n\r\n      outset of the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, telegraphed his precious\r\n\r\n      subordinate to London, where he had been sent on a big case of stolen\r\n\r\n      securities, to return with all haste. Frederic who, at the Surete, was\r\n\r\n      called the \u201cgreat Frederic,\u201d had made all speed, doubtless knowing by\r\n\r\n      experience that, if he was interrupted in what he was doing, it was\r\n\r\n      because his services were urgently needed in another direction; so, as\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille said, he was that morning already \u201cat work.\u201d We soon found\r\n\r\n      out in what it consisted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      What he was continually looking at in the palm of his right hand was\r\n\r\n      nothing but his watch, the minute hand of which he appeared to be noting\r\n\r\n      intently. Then he turned back still running, stopping only when he reached\r\n\r\n      the park gate, where he again consulted his watch and then put it away in\r\n\r\n      his pocket, shrugging his shoulders with a gesture of discouragement. He\r\n\r\n      pushed open the park gate, reclosed and locked it, raised his head and,\r\n\r\n      through the bars, perceived us. Rouletabille rushed after him, and I\r\n\r\n      followed. Frederic Larsan waited for us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Fred,\u201d said Rouletabille, raising his hat and showing the\r\n\r\n      profound respect, based on admiration, which the young reporter felt for\r\n\r\n      the celebrated detective, \u201ccan you tell me whether Monsieur Robert Darzac\r\n\r\n      is at the chateau at this moment? Here is one of his friends, of the Paris\r\n\r\n      Bar, who desires to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI really don\u2019t know, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d replied Fred, shaking hands\r\n\r\n      with my friend, whom he had several times met in the course of his\r\n\r\n      difficult investigations. \u201cI have not seen him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe concierges will be able to inform us no doubt?\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      pointing to the lodge the door and windows of which were close shut.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe concierges will not be able to give you any information, Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause they were arrested half an hour ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cArrested!\u201d cried Rouletabille; \u201cthen they are the murderers!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen you can\u2019t arrest the real murderer,\u201d he said with an air of supreme\r\n\r\n      irony, \u201cyou can always indulge in the luxury of discovering accomplices.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you have them arrested, Monsieur Fred?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot I!\u2014I haven\u2019t had them arrested. In the first place, I am pretty\r\n\r\n      sure that they have not had anything to do with the affair, and then\r\n\r\n      because\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause of what?\u201d asked Rouletabille eagerly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause of nothing,\u201d said Larsan, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause there were no accomplices!\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAha!\u2014you have an idea, then, about this matter?\u201d said Larsan,\r\n\r\n      looking at Rouletabille intently, \u201cyet you have seen nothing, young man\u2014you\r\n\r\n      have not yet gained admission here!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall get admission.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI doubt it. The orders are strict.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall gain admission, if you let me see Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do that\r\n\r\n      for me. You know we are old friends. I beg of you, Monsieur Fred. Do you\r\n\r\n      remember the article I wrote about you on the gold bar case?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The face of Rouletabille at the moment was really funny to look at. It\r\n\r\n      showed such an irresistible desire to cross the threshold beyond which\r\n\r\n      some prodigious mystery had occurred; it appealed with so much eloquence,\r\n\r\n      not only of the mouth and eyes, but with all its features, that I could\r\n\r\n      not refrain from bursting into laughter. Frederic Larsan, no more than\r\n\r\n      myself, could retain his gravity. Meanwhile, standing on the other side of\r\n\r\n      the gate, he calmly put the key in his pocket. I closely scrutinised him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He might be about fifty years of age. He had a fine head, his hair turning\r\n\r\n      grey; a colourless complexion, and a firm profile. His forehead was\r\n\r\n      prominent, his chin and cheeks clean shaven. His upper lip, without\r\n\r\n      moustache, was finely chiselled. His eyes were rather small and round,\r\n\r\n      with a look in them that was at once searching and disquieting. He was of\r\n\r\n      middle height and well built, with a general bearing elegant and\r\n\r\n      gentlemanly. There was nothing about him of the vulgar policeman. In his\r\n\r\n      way, he was an artist, and one felt that he had a high opinion of himself.\r\n\r\n      The sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who had been\r\n\r\n      taught by experience. His strange profession had brought him into contact\r\n\r\n      with so many crimes and villanies that it would have been remarkable if\r\n\r\n      his nature had not been a little hardened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Larsan turned his head at the sound of a vehicle which had come from the\r\n\r\n      chateau and reached the gate behind him. We recognised the cab which had\r\n\r\n      conveyed the examining magistrate and his Registrar from the station at\r\n\r\n      Epinay.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d said Frederic Larsan, \u201cif you want to speak with Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac, he is here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The cab was already at the park gate and Robert Darzac was begging\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan to open it for him, explaining that he was pressed for\r\n\r\n      time to catch the next train leaving Epinay for Paris. Then he recognised\r\n\r\n      me. While Larsan was unlocking the gate, Monsieur Darzac inquired what had\r\n\r\n      brought me to the Glandier at such a tragic moment. I noticed that he was\r\n\r\n      frightfully pale, and that his face was lined as if from the effects of\r\n\r\n      some terrible suffering.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs Mademoiselle getting better?\u201d I immediately asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will be saved perhaps. She must be saved!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He did not add \u201cor it will be my death\u201d; but I felt that the phrase\r\n\r\n      trembled on his pale lips.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille intervened:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are in a hurry, Monsieur; but I must speak with you. I have something\r\n\r\n      of the greatest importance to tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan interrupted:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMay I leave you?\u201d he asked of Robert Darzac. \u201cHave you a key, or do you\r\n\r\n      wish me to give you this one.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThank you. I have a key and will lock the gate.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Larsan hurried off in the direction of the chateau, the imposing pile of\r\n\r\n      which could be perceived a few hundred yards away.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac, with knit brow, was beginning to show impatience. I\r\n\r\n      presented Rouletabille as a good friend of mine, but, as soon as he learnt\r\n\r\n      that the young man was a journalist, he looked at me very reproachfully,\r\n\r\n      excused himself, under the necessity of having to reach Epinay in twenty\r\n\r\n      minutes, bowed, and whipped up his horse. But Rouletabille had seized the\r\n\r\n      bridle and, to my utter astonishment, stopped the carriage with a vigorous\r\n\r\n      hand. Then he gave utterance to a sentence which was utterly meaningless\r\n\r\n      to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its\r\n\r\n      brightness.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The words had no sooner left the lips of Rouletabille than I saw Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac quail. Pale as he was, he became paler. His eyes were fixed on the\r\n\r\n      young man in terror, and he immediately descended from the vehicle in an\r\n\r\n      inexpressible state of agitation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome!\u2014come in!\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, suddenly, and with a sort of fury, he repeated:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet us go, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He turned up by the road he had come from the chateau, Rouletabille still\r\n\r\n      retaining his hold on the horse\u2019s bridle. I addressed a few words to\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac, but he made no answer. My looks questioned Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      but his gaze was elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER VI. In the Heart of the Oak Grove\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We reached the chateau, and, as we approached it, saw four gendarmes\r\n\r\n      pacing in front of a little door in the ground floor of the donjon. We\r\n\r\n      soon learned that in this ground floor, which had formerly served as a\r\n\r\n      prison, Monsieur and Madame Bernier, the concierges, were confined.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac led us into the modern part of the chateau by a\r\n\r\n      large door, protected by a projecting awning\u2014a \u201cmarquise\u201d as it is\r\n\r\n      called. Rouletabille, who had resigned the horse and the cab to the care\r\n\r\n      of a servant, never took his eyes off Monsieur Darzac. I followed his look\r\n\r\n      and perceived that it was directed solely towards the gloved hands of the\r\n\r\n      Sorbonne professor. When we were in a tiny sitting-room fitted with old\r\n\r\n      furniture, Monsieur Darzac turned to Rouletabille and said sharply:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter answered in an equally sharp tone:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo shake you by the hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Darzac shrank back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Evidently he understood, what I also understood, that my friend suspected\r\n\r\n      him of the abominable attempt on the life of Mademoiselle Stangerson. The\r\n\r\n      impression of the blood-stained hand on the walls of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n      in his mind. I looked at the man closely. His haughty face with its\r\n\r\n      expression ordinarily so straightforward was at this moment strangely\r\n\r\n      troubled. He held out his right hand and, referring to me, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs you are a friend of Monsieur Sainclair who has rendered me invaluable\r\n\r\n      services in a just cause, monsieur, I see no reason for refusing you my\r\n\r\n      hand\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille did not take the extended hand. Lying with the utmost\r\n\r\n      audacity, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur, I have lived several years in Russia, where I have acquired the\r\n\r\n      habit of never taking any but an ungloved hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I thought that the Sorbonne professor would express his anger openly, but,\r\n\r\n      on the contrary, by a visibly violent effort, he calmed himself, took off\r\n\r\n      his gloves, and showed his hands; they were unmarked by any cicatrix.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo!\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cMy dear friend,\u201d he said, turning to me, \u201cI\r\n\r\n      am obliged to ask you to leave us alone for a moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I bowed and retired; stupefied by what I had seen and heard. I could not\r\n\r\n      understand why Monsieur Robert Darzac had not already shown the door to my\r\n\r\n      impertinent, insulting, and stupid friend. I was angry myself with\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille at that moment, for his suspicions, which had led to this\r\n\r\n      scene of the gloves.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      For some twenty minutes I walked about in front of the chateau, trying\r\n\r\n      vainly to link together the different events of the day. What was in\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s mind? Was it possible that he thought Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac to be the murderer? How could it be thought that this man, who was\r\n\r\n      to have married Mademoiselle Stangerson in the course of a few days, had\r\n\r\n      introduced himself into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d to assassinate his fiancee? I\r\n\r\n      could find no explanation as to how the murderer had been able to leave\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d; and so long as that mystery, which appeared to me so\r\n\r\n      inexplicable, remained unexplained, I thought it was the duty of all of us\r\n\r\n      to refrain from suspecting anybody. But, then, that seemingly senseless\r\n\r\n      phrase\u2014\u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden\r\n\r\n      its brightness\u201d\u2014still rang in my ears. What did it mean? I was eager\r\n\r\n      to rejoin Rouletabille and question him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment the young man came out of the chateau in the company of\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac, and, extraordinary to relate, I saw, at a glance,\r\n\r\n      that they were the best of friends. \u201cWe are going to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. Come\r\n\r\n      with us,\u201d Rouletabille said to me. \u201cYou know, my dear boy, I am going to\r\n\r\n      keep you with me all day. We\u2019ll breakfast together somewhere about here\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll breakfast with me, here, gentlemen\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d replied the young man. \u201cWe shall breakfast at the Donjon\r\n\r\n      Inn.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll fare very badly there; you\u2019ll not find anything\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think so? Well, I hope to find something there,\u201d replied\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille. \u201cAfter breakfast, we\u2019ll set to work again. I\u2019ll write my\r\n\r\n      article and if you\u2019ll be so good as to take it to the office for me\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWon\u2019t you come back with me to Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo; I shall remain here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I turned towards Rouletabille. He spoke quite seriously, and Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac did not appear to be in the least degree surprised.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were passing by the donjon and heard wailing voices. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy have these people been arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a little my fault,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac. \u201cI happened to remark to\r\n\r\n      the examining magistrate yesterday that it was inexplicable that the\r\n\r\n      concierges had had time to hear the revolver shots, to dress themselves,\r\n\r\n      and to cover so great a distance as that which lies between their lodge\r\n\r\n      and the pavilion, in the space of two minutes; for not more than that\r\n\r\n      interval of time had elapsed after the firing of the shots when they were\r\n\r\n      met by Daddy Jacques.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat was suspicious evidently,\u201d acquiesced Rouletabille. \u201cAnd were they\r\n\r\n      dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is what is so incredible\u2014they were dressed\u2014completely\u2014not\r\n\r\n      one part of their costume wanting. The woman wore sabots, but the man had\r\n\r\n      on laced boots. Now they assert that they went to bed at half-past nine.\r\n\r\n      On arriving this morning, the examining magistrate brought with him from\r\n\r\n      Paris a revolver of the same calibre as that found in the room (for he\r\n\r\n      couldn\u2019t use the one held for evidence), and made his Registrar fire two\r\n\r\n      shots in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d while the doors and windows were closed. We were\r\n\r\n      with him in the lodge of the concierges, and yet we heard nothing, not a\r\n\r\n      sound. The concierges have lied, of that there can be no doubt. They must\r\n\r\n      have been already waiting, not far from the pavilion, waiting for\r\n\r\n      something! Certainly they are not to be accused of being the authors of\r\n\r\n      the crime, but their complicity is not improbable. That was why Monsieur\r\n\r\n      de Marquet had them arrested at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf they had been accomplices,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cthey would not have\r\n\r\n      been there at all. When people throw themselves into the arms of justice\r\n\r\n      with the proofs of complicity on them, you can be sure they are not\r\n\r\n      accomplices. I don\u2019t believe there are any accomplices in this affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, why were they abroad at midnight? Why don\u2019t they say?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have certainly some reason for their silence. What that reason is,\r\n\r\n      has to be found out; for, even if they are not accomplices, it may be of\r\n\r\n      importance. Everything that took place on such a night is important.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We had crossed an old bridge thrown over the Douve and were entering the\r\n\r\n      part of the park called the Oak Grove, The oaks here were centuries old.\r\n\r\n      Autumn had already shrivelled their tawny leaves, and their high branches,\r\n\r\n      black and contorted, looked like horrid heads of hair, mingled with quaint\r\n\r\n      reptiles such as the ancient sculptors have made on the head of Medusa.\r\n\r\n      This place, which Mademoiselle found cheerful and in which she lived in\r\n\r\n      the summer season, appeared to us as sad and funereal now. The soil was\r\n\r\n      black and muddy from the recent rains and the rotting of the fallen\r\n\r\n      leaves; the trunks of the trees were black and the sky above us was now,\r\n\r\n      as if in mourning, charged with great, heavy clouds.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And it was in this sombre and desolate retreat that we saw the white walls\r\n\r\n      of the pavilion as we approached. A queer-looking building without a\r\n\r\n      window visible on the side by which we neared it. A little door alone\r\n\r\n      marked the entrance to it. It might have passed for a tomb, a vast\r\n\r\n      mausoleum in the midst of a thick forest. As we came nearer, we were able\r\n\r\n      to make out its disposition. The building obtained all the light it needed\r\n\r\n      from the south, that is to say, from the open country. The little door\r\n\r\n      closed on the park. Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson must have found\r\n\r\n      it an ideal seclusion for their work and their dreams.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here is the ground plan of the pavilion. It had a ground-floor which was\r\n\r\n      reached by a few steps, and above it was an attic, with which we need not\r\n\r\n      concern ourselves. The plan of the ground-floor only, sketched roughly, is\r\n\r\n      what I here submit to the reader.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The plan was drawn by Rouletabille, and I assured myself that there was\r\n\r\n      not a line in it that was wanting to help to the solution of the problem\r\n\r\n      then set before the police. With the lines of this plan and the\r\n\r\n      description of its parts before them, my readers will know as much as\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille knew when he entered the pavilion for the first time. With\r\n\r\n      him they may now ask: How did the murderer escape from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\r\n\r\n      Before mounting the three steps leading up to the door of the pavilion,\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille stopped and asked Monsieur Darzac point blank:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat was the motive for the crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeaking for myself, Monsieur, there can be no doubt on the matter,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance, greatly distressed. \u201cThe nails of the\r\n\r\n      fingers, the deep scratches on the chest and throat of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson show that the wretch who attacked her attempted to commit a\r\n\r\n      frightful crime. The medical experts who examined these traces yesterday\r\n\r\n      affirm that they were made by the same hand as that which left its red\r\n\r\n      imprint on the wall; an enormous hand, Monsieur, much too large to go into\r\n\r\n      my gloves,\u201d he added with an indefinable smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCould not that blood-stained hand,\u201d I interrupted, \u201chave been the hand of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson who, in the moment of falling, had pressed it\r\n\r\n      against the wall, and, in slipping, enlarged the impression?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was not a drop of blood on either of her hands when she was lifted\r\n\r\n      up,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe are now sure,\u201d said I, \u201cthat it was Mademoiselle Stangerson who was\r\n\r\n      armed with Daddy Jacques\u2019s revolver, since she wounded the hand of the\r\n\r\n      murderer. She was in fear, then, of somebody or something.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cProbably.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you suspect anybody?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac, looking at Rouletabille. Rouletabille then\r\n\r\n      said to me:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou must know, my friend, that the inquiry is a little more advanced than\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet has chosen to tell us. He not only knows that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson defended herself with the revolver, but he knows\r\n\r\n      what the weapon was that was used to attack her. Monsieur Darzac tells me\r\n\r\n      it was a mutton-bone. Why is Monsieur de Marquet surrounding this\r\n\r\n      mutton-bone with so much mystery? No doubt for the purpose of facilitating\r\n\r\n      the inquiries of the agents of the Surete? He imagines, perhaps, that the\r\n\r\n      owner of this instrument of crime, the most terrible invented, is going to\r\n\r\n      be found amongst those who are well-known in the slums of Paris who use\r\n\r\n      it. But who can ever say what passes through the brain of an examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate?\u201d Rouletabille added with contemptuous irony.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHas a mutton-bone been found in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\u201d I asked him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u201d said Robert Darzac, \u201cat the foot of the bed; but I beg of\r\n\r\n      you not to say anything about it.\u201d (I made a gesture of assent.) \u201cIt was\r\n\r\n      an enormous mutton-bone, the top of which, or rather the joint, was still\r\n\r\n      red with the blood of the frightful wound. It was an old bone, which may,\r\n\r\n      according to appearances, have served in other crimes. That\u2019s what\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet thinks. He has had it sent to the municipal laboratory\r\n\r\n      at Paris to be analysed. In fact, he thinks he has detected on it, not\r\n\r\n      only the blood of the last victim, but other stains of dried blood,\r\n\r\n      evidences of previous crimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA mutton-bone in the hand of a skilled assassin is a frightful weapon,\u201d\r\n\r\n       said Rouletabille, \u201ca more certain weapon than a heavy hammer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe scoundrel has proved it to be so,\u201d said Monsieur Robert Darzac,\r\n\r\n      sadly. \u201cThe joint of the bone found exactly fits the wound inflicted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy belief is that the wound would have been mortal, if the murderer\u2019s\r\n\r\n      blow had not been arrested in the act by Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s\r\n\r\n      revolver. Wounded in the hand, he dropped the mutton-bone and fled.\r\n\r\n      Unfortunately, the blow had been already given, and Mademoiselle was\r\n\r\n      stunned after having been nearly strangled. If she had succeeded in\r\n\r\n      wounding the man with the first shot of the revolver, she would,\r\n\r\n      doubtless, have escaped the blow with the bone. But she had certainly\r\n\r\n      employeed her revolver too late; the first shot deviated and lodged in the\r\n\r\n      ceiling; it was the second only that took effect.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having said this, Monsieur Darzac knocked at the door of the pavilion. I\r\n\r\n      must confess to feeling a strong impatience to reach the spot where the\r\n\r\n      crime had been committed. It was some time before the door was opened by a\r\n\r\n      man whom I at once recognised as Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He appeared to be well over sixty years of age. He had a long white beard\r\n\r\n      and white hair, on which he wore a flat Basque cap. He was dressed in a\r\n\r\n      complete suit of chestnut-coloured velveteen, worn at the sides; sabots\r\n\r\n      were on his feet. He had rather a waspish-looking face, the expression of\r\n\r\n      which lightened, however, as soon as he saw Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFriends,\u201d said our guide. \u201cNobody in the pavilion, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI ought not to allow anybody to enter, Monsieur Robert, but of course the\r\n\r\n      order does not apply to you. These gentlemen of justice have seen\r\n\r\n      everything there is to be seen, and made enough drawings, and drawn up\r\n\r\n      enough reports\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur Jacques, one question before anything else,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it, young man? If I can answer it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid your mistress wear her hair in bands, that evening? You know what I\r\n\r\n      mean\u2014over her forehead?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, young man. My mistress never wore her hair in the way you suggest,\r\n\r\n      neither on that day nor on any other. She had her hair drawn up, as usual,\r\n\r\n      so that her beautiful forehead could be seen, pure as that of an unborn\r\n\r\n      child!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille grunted and set to work examining the door, finding that it\r\n\r\n      fastened itself automatically. He satisfied himself that it could never\r\n\r\n      remain open and needed a key to open it. Then we entered the vestibule, a\r\n\r\n      small, well-lit room paved with square red tiles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! This is the window by which the murderer escaped!\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo they keep on saying, monsieur, so they keep on saying! But if he had\r\n\r\n      gone off that way, we should have been sure to have seen him. We are not\r\n\r\n      blind, neither Monsieur Stangerson nor me, nor the concierges who are in\r\n\r\n      prison. Why have they not put me in prison, too, on account of my\r\n\r\n      revolver?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had already opened the window and was examining the shutters.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWere these closed at the time of the crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd fastened with the iron catch inside,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, \u201cand I am\r\n\r\n      quite sure that the murderer did not get out that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre there any blood stains?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, on the stones outside; but blood of what?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cthere are footmarks visible on the path\u2014the\r\n\r\n      ground was very moist. I will look into that presently.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNonsense!\u201d interrupted Daddy Jacques; \u201cthe murderer did not go that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhich way did he go, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do I know?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at everything, smelled everything. He went down on his\r\n\r\n      knees and rapidly examined every one of the paving tiles. Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u2014you can\u2019t find anything, monsieur. Nothing has been found. And\r\n\r\n      now it is all dirty; too many persons have tramped over it. They wouldn\u2019t\r\n\r\n      let me wash it, but on the day of the crime I had washed the floor\r\n\r\n      thoroughly, and if the murderer had crossed it with his hobnailed boots, I\r\n\r\n      should not have failed to see where he had been; he has left marks enough\r\n\r\n      in Mademoiselle\u2019s chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille rose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen was the last time you washed these tiles?\u201d he asked, and he fixed on\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques a most searching look.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy\u2014as I told you\u2014on the day of the crime, towards half-past\r\n\r\n      five\u2014while Mademoiselle and her father were taking a little walk\r\n\r\n      before dinner, here in this room: they had dined in the laboratory. The\r\n\r\n      next day, the examining magistrate came and saw all the marks there were\r\n\r\n      on the floor as plainly as if they had been made with ink on white paper.\r\n\r\n      Well, neither in the laboratory nor in the vestibule, which were both as\r\n\r\n      clean as a new pin, were there any traces of a man\u2019s footmarks. Since they\r\n\r\n      have been found near this window outside, he must have made his way\r\n\r\n      through the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d into the attic, then cut his way\r\n\r\n      through the roof and dropped to the ground outside the vestibule window.\r\n\r\n      But\u2014there\u2019s no hole, neither in the ceiling of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d nor\r\n\r\n      in the roof of my attic\u2014that\u2019s absolutely certain! So you see we\r\n\r\n      know nothing\u2014nothing! And nothing will ever be known! It\u2019s a mystery\r\n\r\n      of the Devil\u2019s own making.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille went down upon his knees again almost in front of a small\r\n\r\n      lavatory at the back of the vestibule. In that position he remained for\r\n\r\n      about a minute.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell?\u201d I asked him when he got up.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! nothing very important,\u2014a drop of blood,\u201d he replied, turning\r\n\r\n      towards Daddy Jacques as he spoke. \u201cWhile you were washing the laboratory\r\n\r\n      and this vestibule, was the vestibule window open?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur, it was closed; but after I had done washing the floor, I\r\n\r\n      lit some charcoal for Monsieur in the laboratory furnace, and, as I lit it\r\n\r\n      with old newspapers, it smoked, so I opened both the windows in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory and this one, to make a current of air; then I shut those in\r\n\r\n      the laboratory and left this one open when I went out. When I returned to\r\n\r\n      the pavilion, this window had been closed and Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      were already at work in the laboratory.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson had, no doubt, shut it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou did not ask them?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      After a close scrutiny of the little lavatory and of the staircase leading\r\n\r\n      up to the attic, Rouletabille\u2014to whom we seemed no longer to exist\u2014entered\r\n\r\n      the laboratory. I followed him. It was, I confess, in a state of great\r\n\r\n      excitement. Robert Darzac lost none of my friend\u2019s movements. As for me,\r\n\r\n      my eyes were drawn at once to the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. It was closed\r\n\r\n      and, as I immediately saw, partially shattered and out of commission.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend, who went about his work methodically, silently studied the room\r\n\r\n      in which we were. It was large and well-lighted. Two big windows\u2014almost\r\n\r\n      bays\u2014were protected by strong iron bars and looked out upon a wide\r\n\r\n      extent of country. Through an opening in the forest, they commanded a\r\n\r\n      wonderful view through the length of the valley and across the plain to\r\n\r\n      the large town which could be clearly seen in fair weather. To-day,\r\n\r\n      however, a mist hung over the ground\u2014and blood in that room!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The whole of one side of the laboratory was taken up with a large chimney,\r\n\r\n      crucibles, ovens, and such implements as are needed for chemical\r\n\r\n      experiments; tables, loaded with phials, papers, reports, an electrical\r\n\r\n      machine,\u2014an apparatus, as Monsieur Darzac informed me, employeed by\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson to demonstrate the Dissociation of Matter under the\r\n\r\n      action of solar light\u2014and other scientific implements.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Along the walls were cabinets, plain or glass-fronted, through which were\r\n\r\n      visible microscopes, special photographic apparatus, and a large quantity\r\n\r\n      of crystals.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, who was ferreting in the chimney, put his fingers into one\r\n\r\n      of the crucibles. Suddenly he drew himself up, and held up a piece of\r\n\r\n      half-consumed paper in his hand. He stepped up to where we were talking by\r\n\r\n      one of the windows.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cKeep that for us, Monsieur Darzac,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I bent over the piece of scorched paper which Monsieur Darzac took from\r\n\r\n      the hand of Rouletabille, and read distinctly the only words that remained\r\n\r\n      legible:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPresbytery\u2014lost nothing\u2014charm, nor the gar\u2014its\r\n\r\n      brightness.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Twice since the morning these same meaningless words had struck me, and,\r\n\r\n      for the second time, I saw that they produced on the Sorbonne professor\r\n\r\n      the same paralysing effect. Monsieur Darzac\u2019s first anxiety showed itself\r\n\r\n      when he turned his eyes in the direction of Daddy Jacques. But, occupied\r\n\r\n      as he was at another window, he had seen nothing. Then tremblingly opening\r\n\r\n      his pocket-book he put the piece of paper into it, sighing: \u201cMy God!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      During this time, Rouletabille had mounted into the opening of the\r\n\r\n      fire-grate\u2014that is to say, he had got upon the bricks of a furnace\u2014and\r\n\r\n      was attentively examining the chimney, which grew narrower towards the\r\n\r\n      top, the outlet from it being closed with sheets of iron, fastened into\r\n\r\n      the brickwork, through which passed three small chimneys.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cImpossible to get out that way,\u201d he said, jumping back into the\r\n\r\n      laboratory. \u201cBesides, even if he had tried to do it, he would have brought\r\n\r\n      all that ironwork down to the ground. No, no; it is not on that side we\r\n\r\n      have to search.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille next examined the furniture and opened the doors of the\r\n\r\n      cabinet. Then he came to the windows, through which he declared no one\r\n\r\n      could possibly have passed. At the second window he found Daddy Jacques in\r\n\r\n      contemplation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, Daddy Jacques,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat are you looking at?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat policeman who is always going round and round the lake. Another of\r\n\r\n      those fellows who think they can see better than anybody else!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t know Frederic Larsan, Daddy Jacques, or you wouldn\u2019t speak of\r\n\r\n      him in that way,\u201d said Rouletabille in a melancholy tone. \u201cIf there is\r\n\r\n      anyone who will find the murderer, it will be he.\u201d And Rouletabille heaved\r\n\r\n      a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBefore they find him, they will have to learn how they lost him,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques, stolidly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At length we reached the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d itself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is the door behind which some terrible scene took place,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, with a solemnity which, under any other circumstances, would\r\n\r\n      have been comical.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER VII. In Which Rouletabille Sets Out on an Expedition Under the Bed\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille having pushed open the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d paused on the\r\n\r\n      threshold saying, with an emotion which I only later understood, \u201cAh, the\r\n\r\n      perfume of the lady in black!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The chamber was dark. Daddy Jacques was about to open the blinds when\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille stopped him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid not the tragedy take place in complete darkness?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, young man, I don\u2019t think so. Mademoiselle always had a nightlight on\r\n\r\n      her table, and I lit it every evening before she went to bed. I was a sort\r\n\r\n      of chambermaid, you must understand, when the evening came. The real\r\n\r\n      chambermaid did not come here much before the morning. Mademoiselle worked\r\n\r\n      late\u2014far into the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere did the table with the night-light stand,\u2014far from the bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSome way from the bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan you light the burner now?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled when the table\r\n\r\n      was upset. All the rest of the things in the room remain just as they\r\n\r\n      were. I have only to open the blinds for you to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWait.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the shutters of the two\r\n\r\n      windows and the door of the vestibule.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place where\r\n\r\n      the night-light was burning that night.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques who was in his stockings\u2014he usually left his sabots in\r\n\r\n      the vestibule\u2014entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d with his bit of a vesta. We\r\n\r\n      vaguely distinguished objects overthrown on the floor, a bed in one\r\n\r\n      corner, and, in front of us, to the left, the gleam of a looking-glass\r\n\r\n      hanging on the wall, near to the bed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat will do!\u2014you may now open the blinds,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t come any further,\u201d Daddy Jacques begged, \u201cyou may make marks with\r\n\r\n      your boots, and nothing must be deranged; it\u2019s an idea of the magistrate\u2019s\u2014though\r\n\r\n      he has nothing more to do here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he pushed open the shutter. The pale daylight entered from without,\r\n\r\n      throwing a sinister light on the saffron-coloured walls. The floor\u2014for\r\n\r\n      though the laboratory and the vestibule were tiled, \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d had a\r\n\r\n      flooring of wood\u2014was covered with a single yellow mat which was\r\n\r\n      large enough to cover nearly the whole room, under the bed and under the\r\n\r\n      dressing-table\u2014the only piece of furniture that remained upright.\r\n\r\n      The centre round table, the night-table and two chairs had been\r\n\r\n      overturned. These did not prevent a large stain of blood being visible on\r\n\r\n      the mat, made, as Daddy Jacques informed us, by the blood which had flowed\r\n\r\n      from the wound on Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s forehead. Besides these\r\n\r\n      stains, drops of blood had fallen in all directions, in line with the\r\n\r\n      visible traces of the footsteps\u2014large and black\u2014of the\r\n\r\n      murderer. Everything led to the presumption that these drops of blood had\r\n\r\n      fallen from the wound of the man who had, for a moment, placed his red\r\n\r\n      hand on the wall. There were other traces of the same hand on the wall,\r\n\r\n      but much less distinct.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSee!\u2014see this blood on the wall!\u201d I could not help exclaiming. \u201cThe\r\n\r\n      man who pressed his hand so heavily upon it in the darkness must certainly\r\n\r\n      have thought that he was pushing at a door! That\u2019s why he pressed on it so\r\n\r\n      hard, leaving on the yellow paper the terrible evidence. I don\u2019t think\r\n\r\n      there are many hands in the world of that sort. It is big and strong and\r\n\r\n      the fingers are nearly all one as long as the other! The thumb is wanting\r\n\r\n      and we have only the mark of the palm; but if we follow the trace of the\r\n\r\n      hand,\u201d I continued, \u201cwe see that, after leaving its imprint on the wall,\r\n\r\n      the touch sought the door, found it, and then felt for the lock\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt,\u201d interrupted Rouletabille, chuckling,\u2014\u201conly there is no\r\n\r\n      blood, either on the lock or on the bolt!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does that prove?\u201d I rejoined with a good sense of which I was proud;\r\n\r\n      \u201che might have opened the lock with his left hand, which would have been\r\n\r\n      quite natural, his right hand being wounded.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe didn\u2019t open it at all!\u201d Daddy Jacques again exclaimed. \u201cWe are not\r\n\r\n      fools; and there were four of us when we burst open the door!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a queer hand!\u2014Look what a queer hand it is!\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a very natural hand,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cof which the shape has\r\n\r\n      been deformed by its having slipped on the wall. The man dried his hand on\r\n\r\n      the wall. He must be a man about five feet eight in height.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you come at that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the height of the marks on the wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend next occupied himself with the mark of the bullet in the wall.\r\n\r\n      It was a round hole.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis ball was fired straight, not from above, and consequently, not from\r\n\r\n      below.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the lock and the\r\n\r\n      bolt, satisfying himself that the door had certainly been burst open from\r\n\r\n      the outside, and, further, that the key had been found in the lock on the\r\n\r\n      inside of the chamber. He finally satisfied himself that with the key in\r\n\r\n      the lock, the door could not possibly be opened from without with another\r\n\r\n      key. Having made sure of all these details, he let fall these words:\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d\u2014Then sitting down on the ground, he hastily took\r\n\r\n      off his boots and, in his socks, went into the room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The first thing he did was to examine minutely the overturned furniture.\r\n\r\n      We watched him in silence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYoung fellow, you are giving yourself a great deal of trouble,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques ironically.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille raised his head and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have spoken the simple truth, Daddy Jacques; your mistress did not\r\n\r\n      have her hair in bands that evening. I was a donkey to have believed she\r\n\r\n      did.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, with the suppleness of a serpent, he slipped under the bed.\r\n\r\n      Presently we heard him ask:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt what time, Monsieur Jacques, did Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      arrive at the laboratory?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt six o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The voice of Rouletabille continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u2014he\u2019s been under here,\u2014that\u2019s certain; in fact, there was\r\n\r\n      no where else where he could have hidden himself. Here, too, are the marks\r\n\r\n      of his hobnails. When you entered\u2014all four of you\u2014did you look\r\n\r\n      under the bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt once,\u2014we drew it right out of its place\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd between the mattresses?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was only one on the bed, and on that Mademoiselle was placed; and\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge immediately carried it into the\r\n\r\n      laboratory. Under the mattress there was nothing but the metal netting,\r\n\r\n      which could not conceal anything or anybody. Remember, monsieur, that\r\n\r\n      there were four of us and we couldn\u2019t fail to see everything\u2014the\r\n\r\n      chamber is so small and scantily furnished, and all was locked behind in\r\n\r\n      the pavilion.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I ventured on a hypothesis:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps he got away with the mattress\u2014in the mattress!\u2014Anything\r\n\r\n      is possible, in the face of such a mystery! In their distress of mind\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge may not have noticed they were\r\n\r\n      bearing a double weight; especially if the concierge were an accomplice! I\r\n\r\n      throw out this hypothesis for what it is worth, but it explains many\r\n\r\n      things,\u2014and particularly the fact that neither the laboratory nor\r\n\r\n      the vestibule bear any traces of the footmarks found in the room. If, in\r\n\r\n      carrying Mademoiselle on the mattress from the laboratory of the chateau,\r\n\r\n      they rested for a moment, there might have been an opportunity for the man\r\n\r\n      in it to escape.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then?\u201d asked Rouletabille, deliberately laughing under the bed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I felt rather vexed and replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u2014but anything appears possible\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe examining magistrate had the same idea, monsieur,\u201d said Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques, \u201cand he carefully examined the mattress. He was obliged to laugh\r\n\r\n      at the idea, monsieur, as your friend is doing now,\u2014for whoever\r\n\r\n      heard of a mattress having a double bottom?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was myself obliged to laugh, on seeing that what I had said was absurd;\r\n\r\n      but in an affair like this one hardly knows where an absurdity begins or\r\n\r\n      ends.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend alone seemed able to talk intelligently. He called out from\r\n\r\n      under the bed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe mat here has been moved out of place,\u2014who did it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe did, monsieur,\u201d explained Daddy Jacques. \u201cWhen we could not find the\r\n\r\n      assassin, we asked ourselves whether there was not some hole in the floor\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is not,\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cIs there a cellar?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, there\u2019s no cellar. But that has not stopped our searching, and has\r\n\r\n      not prevented the examining magistrate and his Registrar from studying the\r\n\r\n      floor plank by plank, as if there had been a cellar under it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter then reappeared. His eyes were sparkling and his nostrils\r\n\r\n      quivered. He remained on his hands and knees. He could not be better\r\n\r\n      likened than to an admirable sporting dog on the scent of some unusual\r\n\r\n      game. And, indeed, he was scenting the steps of a man,\u2014the man whom\r\n\r\n      he has sworn to report to his master, the manager of the \u201cEpoque.\u201d It must\r\n\r\n      not be forgotten that Rouletabille was first and last a journalist.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Thus, on his hands and knees, he made his way to the four corners of the\r\n\r\n      room, so to speak, sniffing and going round everything\u2014everything\r\n\r\n      that we could see, which was not much, and everything that we could not\r\n\r\n      see, which must have been infinite.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The toilette table was a simple table standing on four legs; there was\r\n\r\n      nothing about it by which it could possibly be changed into a temporary\r\n\r\n      hiding-place. There was not a closet or cupboard. Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      kept her wardrobe at the chateau.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille literally passed his nose and hands along the walls,\r\n\r\n      constructed of solid brickwork. When he had finished with the walls, and\r\n\r\n      passed his agile fingers over every portion of the yellow paper covering\r\n\r\n      them, he reached to the ceiling, which he was able to touch by mounting on\r\n\r\n      a chair placed on the toilette table, and by moving this ingeniously\r\n\r\n      constructed stage from place to place he examined every foot of it. When\r\n\r\n      he had finished his scrutiny of the ceiling, where he carefully examined\r\n\r\n      the hole made by the second bullet, he approached the window, and, once\r\n\r\n      more, examined the iron bars and blinds, all of which were solid and\r\n\r\n      intact. At last, he gave a grunt of satisfaction and declared \u201cNow I am at\r\n\r\n      ease!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u2014do you believe that the poor dear young lady was shut up when\r\n\r\n      she was being murdered\u2014when she cried out for help?\u201d wailed Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said the young reporter, drying his forehead, \u201c\u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was\r\n\r\n      as tightly shut as an iron safe.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cis why this mystery is the most surprising I know. Edgar\r\n\r\n      Allan Poe, in \u2018The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\u2019 invented nothing like it.\r\n\r\n      The place of that crime was sufficiently closed to prevent the escape of a\r\n\r\n      man; but there was that window through which the monkey, the perpetrator\r\n\r\n      of the murder, could slip away! But here, there can be no question of an\r\n\r\n      opening of any sort. The door was fastened, and through the window blinds,\r\n\r\n      secure as they were, not even a fly could enter or get out.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTrue, true,\u201d assented Rouletabille as he kept on drying his forehead,\r\n\r\n      which seemed to be perspiring less from his recent bodily exertion than\r\n\r\n      from his mental agitation. \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s a great, a beautiful, and a very\r\n\r\n      curious mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Bete du bon Dieu,\u201d muttered Daddy Jacques, \u201cthe Bete du bon Dieu\r\n\r\n      herself, if she had committed the crime, could not have escaped. Listen!\r\n\r\n      Do you hear it? Hush!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques made us a sign to keep quiet and, stretching his arm towards\r\n\r\n      the wall nearest the forest, listened to something which we could not\r\n\r\n      hear.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s answering,\u201d he said at length. \u201cI must kill it. It is too wicked,\r\n\r\n      but it\u2019s the Bete du bon Dieu, and, every night, it goes to pray on the\r\n\r\n      tomb of Sainte-Genevieve and nobody dares to touch her, for fear that\r\n\r\n      Mother Angenoux should cast an evil spell on them.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow big is the Bete du bon Dieu?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNearly as big as a small retriever,\u2014a monster, I tell you. Ah!\u2014I\r\n\r\n      have asked myself more than once whether it was not her that took our poor\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle by the throat with her claws. But the Bete du bon Dieu does\r\n\r\n      not wear hobnailed boots, nor fire revolvers, nor has she a hand like\r\n\r\n      that!\u201d exclaimed Daddy Jacques, again pointing out to us the red mark on\r\n\r\n      the wall. \u201cBesides, we should have seen her as well as we would have seen\r\n\r\n      a man\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently,\u201d I said. \u201cBefore we had seen this Yellow Room, I had also\r\n\r\n      asked myself whether the cat of Mother Angenoux\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou also!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot for a moment. After reading the article in the \u2018Matin,\u2019 I knew that a\r\n\r\n      cat had nothing to do with the matter. But I swear now that a frightful\r\n\r\n      tragedy has been enacted here. You say nothing about the Basque cap, or\r\n\r\n      the handkerchief, found here, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf course, the magistrate has taken them,\u201d the old man answered,\r\n\r\n      hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI haven\u2019t seen either the handkerchief or the cap, yet I can tell you how\r\n\r\n      they are made,\u201d the reporter said to him gravely.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, you are very clever,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, coughing and embarrassed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe handkerchief is a large one, blue with red stripes and the cap is an\r\n\r\n      old Basque cap, like the one you are wearing now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are a wizard!\u201d said Daddy Jacques, trying to laugh and not quite\r\n\r\n      succeeding. \u201cHow do you know that the handkerchief is blue with red\r\n\r\n      stripes?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause, if it had not been blue with red stripes, it would not have been\r\n\r\n      found at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Without giving any further attention to Daddy Jacques, my friend took a\r\n\r\n      piece of paper from his pocket, and taking out a pair of scissors, bent\r\n\r\n      over the footprints. Placing the paper over one of them he began to cut.\r\n\r\n      In a short time he had made a perfect pattern which he handed to me,\r\n\r\n      begging me not to lose it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He then returned to the window and, pointing to the figure of Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan, who had not quitted the side of the lake, asked Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      whether the detective had, like himself, been working in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied Robert Darzac, who, since Rouletabille had handed him the\r\n\r\n      piece of scorched paper, had not uttered a word, \u201cHe pretends that he does\r\n\r\n      not need to examine \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. He says that the murderer made his\r\n\r\n      escape from it in quite a natural way, and that he will, this evening,\r\n\r\n      explain how he did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As he listened to what Monsieur Darzac had to say, Rouletabille turned\r\n\r\n      pale.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHas Frederic Larsan found out the truth, which I can only guess at?\u201d he\r\n\r\n      murmured. \u201cHe is very clever\u2014very clever\u2014and I admire him. But\r\n\r\n      what we have to do to-day is something more than the work of a policeman,\r\n\r\n      something quite different from the teachings of experience. We have to\r\n\r\n      take hold of our reason by the right end.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter rushed into the open air, agitated by the thought that the\r\n\r\n      great and famous Fred might anticipate him in the solution of the problem\r\n\r\n      of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I managed to reach him on the threshold of the pavilion. \u201cCalm yourself,\r\n\r\n      my dear fellow,\u201d I said. \u201cAren\u2019t you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he confessed to me, with a deep sigh. \u201cI am quite satisfied. I have\r\n\r\n      discovered many things.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMoral or material?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSeveral moral,\u2014one material. This, for example.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And rapidly he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper in which he\r\n\r\n      had placed a light-coloured hair from a woman\u2019s head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER VIII. The Examining Magistrate Questions Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Two minutes later, as Rouletabille was bending over the footprints\r\n\r\n      discovered in the park, under the window of the vestibule, a man,\r\n\r\n      evidently a servant at the chateau, came towards us rapidly and called out\r\n\r\n      to Monsieur Darzac then coming out of the pavilion:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Robert, the magistrate, you know, is questioning Mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac uttered a muttered excuse to us and set off running\r\n\r\n      towards the chateau, the man running after him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf the corpse can speak,\u201d I said, \u201cit would be interesting to be there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must know,\u201d said my friend. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the chateau.\u201d And he drew me\r\n\r\n      with him. But, at the chateau, a gendarme placed in the vestibule denied\r\n\r\n      us admission up the staircase of the first floor. We were obliged to wait\r\n\r\n      down stairs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This is what passed in the chamber of the victim while we were waiting\r\n\r\n      below.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The family doctor, finding that Mademoiselle Stangerson was much better,\r\n\r\n      but fearing a relapse which would no longer permit of her being\r\n\r\n      questioned, had thought it his duty to inform the examining magistrate of\r\n\r\n      this, who decided to proceed immediately with a brief examination. At this\r\n\r\n      examination, the Registrar, Monsieur Stangerson, and the doctor were\r\n\r\n      present. Later, I obtained the text of the report of the examination, and\r\n\r\n      I give it here, in all its legal dryness:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuestion. Are you able, mademoiselle, without too much fatiguing\r\n\r\n      yourself, to give some necessary details of the frightful attack of which\r\n\r\n      you have been the victim?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnswer. I feel much better, monsieur, and I will tell you all I know.\r\n\r\n      When I entered my chamber I did not notice anything unusual there.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Excuse me, mademoiselle,\u2014if you will allow me, I will ask you\r\n\r\n      some questions and you will answer them. That will fatigue you less than\r\n\r\n      making a long recital.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. Do so, monsieur.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. What did you do on that day?\u2014I want you to be as minute and\r\n\r\n      precise as possible. I wish to know all you did that day, if it is not\r\n\r\n      asking too much of you.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. I rose late, at ten o\u2019clock, for my father and I had returned home\r\n\r\n      late on the night previously, having been to dinner at the reception given\r\n\r\n      by the President of the Republic, in honour of the Academy of Science of\r\n\r\n      Philadelphia. When I left my chamber, at half-past ten, my father was\r\n\r\n      already at work in the laboratory. We worked together till midday. We then\r\n\r\n      took half-an-hour\u2019s walk in the park, as we were accustomed to do, before\r\n\r\n      breakfasting at the chateau. After breakfast, we took another walk for\r\n\r\n      half an hour, and then returned to the laboratory. There we found my\r\n\r\n      chambermaid, who had come to set my room in order. I went into The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room to give her some slight orders and she directly afterwards left the\r\n\r\n      pavilion, and I resumed my work with my father. At five o\u2019clock, we again\r\n\r\n      went for a walk in the park and afterward had tea.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Before leaving the pavilion at five o\u2019clock, did you go into your\r\n\r\n      chamber?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. No, monsieur, my father went into it, at my request to bring me my\r\n\r\n      hat.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. And he found nothing suspicious there?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. Evidently no, monsieur.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. It is, then, almost certain that the murderer was not yet concealed\r\n\r\n      under the bed. When you went out, was the door of the room locked?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. No, there was no reason for locking it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. You were absent from the pavilion some length of time, Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and you?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. About an hour.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. It was during that hour, no doubt, that the murderer got into the\r\n\r\n      pavilion. But how? Nobody knows. Footmarks have been found in the park,\r\n\r\n      leading away from the window of the vestibule, but none has been found\r\n\r\n      going towards it. Did you notice whether the vestibule window was open\r\n\r\n      when you went out?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. I don\u2019t remember.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Stangerson. It was closed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. And when you returned?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson. I did not notice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. Stangerson. It was still closed. I remember remarking aloud: \u2018Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques must surely have opened it while we were away.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Strange!\u2014Do you recollect, Monsieur Stangerson, if during your\r\n\r\n      absence, and before going out, he had opened it? You returned to the\r\n\r\n      laboratory at six o\u2019clock and resumed work?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson. Yes, monsieur.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. And you did not leave the laboratory from that hour up to the moment\r\n\r\n      when you entered your chamber?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. Stangerson. Neither my daughter nor I, monsieur. We were engaged on\r\n\r\n      work that was pressing, and we lost not a moment,\u2014neglecting\r\n\r\n      everything else on that account.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Did you dine in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. For that reason.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Are you accustomed to dine in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. We rarely dine there.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Could the murderer have known that you would dine there that evening?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. Stangerson. Good Heavens!\u2014I think not. It was only when we\r\n\r\n      returned to the pavilion at six o\u2019clock, that we decided, my daughter and\r\n\r\n      I, to dine there. At that moment I was spoken to by my gamekeeper, who\r\n\r\n      detained me a moment, to ask me to accompany him on an urgent tour of\r\n\r\n      inspection in a part of the woods which I had decided to thin. I put this\r\n\r\n      off until the next day, and begged him, as he was going by the chateau, to\r\n\r\n      tell the steward that we should dine in the laboratory. He left me, to\r\n\r\n      execute the errand and I rejoined my daughter, who was already at work.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. At what hour, mademoiselle, did you go to your chamber while your\r\n\r\n      father continued to work there?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. At midnight.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. Did Daddy Jacques enter \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d in the course of the evening?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. To shut the blinds and light the night-light.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. He saw nothing suspicious?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. He would have told us if he had seen. Daddy Jacques is an honest man\r\n\r\n      and very attached to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. You affirm, Monsieur Stangerson, that Daddy Jacques remained with you\r\n\r\n      all the time you were in the laboratory?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cM. Stangerson. I am sure of it. I have no doubt of that.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. When you entered your chamber, mademoiselle, you immediately shut the\r\n\r\n      door and locked and bolted it? That was taking unusual precautions,\r\n\r\n      knowing that your father and your servant were there? Were you in fear of\r\n\r\n      something, then?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. My father would be returning to the chateau and Daddy Jacques would be\r\n\r\n      going to his bed. And, in fact, I did fear something.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. You were so much in fear of something that you borrowed Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques\u2019s revolver without telling him you had done so?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. That is true. I did not wish to alarm anybody,\u2014the more, because\r\n\r\n      my fears might have proved to have been foolish.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. What was it you feared?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. I hardly know how to tell you. For several nights, I seemed to hear,\r\n\r\n      both in the park and out of the park, round the pavilion, unusual sounds,\r\n\r\n      sometimes footsteps, at other times the cracking of branches. The night\r\n\r\n      before the attack on me, when I did not get to bed before three o\u2019clock in\r\n\r\n      the morning, on our return from the Elysee, I stood for a moment before my\r\n\r\n      window, and I felt sure I saw shadows.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQ. How many?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA. Two. They moved round the lake,\u2014then the moon became clouded and\r\n\r\n      I lost sight of them. At this time of the season, every year, I have\r\n\r\n      generally returned to my apartment in the chateau for the winter; but this\r\n\r\n      year I said to myself that I would not quit the pavilion before my father\r\n\r\n      had finished the resume of his works on the \u2018Dissociation of Matter\u2019 for\r\n\r\n      the Academy. I did not wish that that important work, which was to have\r\n\r\n      been finished in the course of a few days, should be delayed by a change\r\n\r\n      in our daily habit. You can well understand that I did not wish to speak\r\n\r\n      of my childish fears to my father, nor did I say anything to Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      who, I knew, would not have been able to hold his tongue. Knowing that he\r\n\r\n      had a revolver in his room, I took advantage of his absence and borrowed\r\n\r\n      it, placing it in the drawer of my night-table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the interrogation of Mademoiselle Stangerson concluded.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille waited patiently for Monsieur Robert Darzac, who soon\r\n\r\n      appeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      From a room near the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had heard the\r\n\r\n      interrogatory and now came to recount it to my friend with great\r\n\r\n      exactitude, aided by an excellent memory. His docility still surprised me.\r\n\r\n      Thanks to hasty pencil-notes, he was able to reproduce, almost textually,\r\n\r\n      the questions and the answers given.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It looked as if Monsieur Darzac were being employeed as the secretary of my\r\n\r\n      young friend and acted as if he could refuse him nothing; nay, more, as if\r\n\r\n      under a compulsion to do so.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The fact of the closed window struck the reporter as it had struck the\r\n\r\n      magistrate. Rouletabille asked Darzac to repeat once more Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s account of how she and her father had spent their time on the\r\n\r\n      day of the tragedy, as she had stated it to the magistrate. The\r\n\r\n      circumstance of the dinner in the laboratory seemed to interest him in the\r\n\r\n      highest degree; and he had it repeated to him three times. He also wanted\r\n\r\n      to be sure that the forest-keeper knew that the professor and his daughter\r\n\r\n      were going to dine in the laboratory, and how he had come to know it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When Monsieur Darzac had finished, I said: \u201cThe examination has not\r\n\r\n      advanced the problem much.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt has put it back,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt has thrown light upon it,\u201d said Rouletabille, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER IX. Reporter and Detective\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The three of us went back towards the pavilion. At some distance from the\r\n\r\n      building the reporter made us stop and, pointing to a small clump of trees\r\n\r\n      to the right of us, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s where the murderer came from to get into the pavilion.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As there were other patches of trees of the same sort between the great\r\n\r\n      oaks, I asked why the murderer had chosen that one, rather than any of the\r\n\r\n      others. Rouletabille answered me by pointing to the path which ran quite\r\n\r\n      close to the thicket to the door of the pavilion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat path is as you see, topped with gravel,\u201d he said; \u201cthe man must have\r\n\r\n      passed along it going to the pavilion, since no traces of his steps have\r\n\r\n      been found on the soft ground. The man didn\u2019t have wings; he walked; but\r\n\r\n      he walked on the gravel which left no impression of his tread. The gravel\r\n\r\n      has, in fact, been trodden by many other feet, since the path is the most\r\n\r\n      direct way between the pavilion and the chateau. As to the thicket, made\r\n\r\n      of the sort of shrubs that don\u2019t flourish in the rough season\u2014laurels\r\n\r\n      and fuchsias\u2014it offered the murderer a sufficient hiding-place until\r\n\r\n      it was time for him to make his way to the pavilion. It was while hiding\r\n\r\n      in that clump of trees that he saw Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson,\r\n\r\n      and then Daddy Jacques, leave the pavilion. Gravel has been spread nearly,\r\n\r\n      very nearly, up to the windows of the pavilion. The footprints of a man,\r\n\r\n      parallel with the wall\u2014marks which we will examine presently, and\r\n\r\n      which I have already seen\u2014prove that he only needed to make one\r\n\r\n      stride to find himself in front of the vestibule window, left open by\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques. The man drew himself up by his hands and entered the\r\n\r\n      vestibule.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter all it is very possible,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter all what? After all what?\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I begged of him not to be angry; but he was too much irritated to listen\r\n\r\n      to me and declared, ironically, that he admired the prudent doubt with\r\n\r\n      which certain people approached the most simple problems, risking nothing\r\n\r\n      by saying \u201cthat is so, or \u2018that is not so.\u201d Their intelligence would have\r\n\r\n      produced about the same result if nature had forgotten to furnish their\r\n\r\n      brain-pan with a little grey matter. As I appeared vexed, my young friend\r\n\r\n      took me by the arm and admitted that he had not meant that for me; he\r\n\r\n      thought more of me than that.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I did not reason as I do in regard to this gravel,\u201d he went on, \u201cI\r\n\r\n      should have to assume a balloon!\u2014My dear fellow, the science of the\r\n\r\n      aerostation of dirigible balloons is not yet developed enough for me to\r\n\r\n      consider it and suppose that a murderer would drop from the clouds! So\r\n\r\n      don\u2019t say a thing is possible, when it could not be otherwise. We know now\r\n\r\n      how the man entered by the window, and we also know the moment at which he\r\n\r\n      entered,\u2014during the five o\u2019clock walk of the professor and his\r\n\r\n      daughter. The fact of the presence of the chambermaid\u2014who had come\r\n\r\n      to clean up \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\u2014in the laboratory, when Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and his daughter returned from their walk, at half-past one,\r\n\r\n      permits us to affirm that at half-past one the murderer was not in the\r\n\r\n      chamber under the bed, unless he was in collusion with the chambermaid.\r\n\r\n      What do you say, Monsieur Darzac?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac shook his head and said he was sure of the chambermaid\u2019s\r\n\r\n      fidelity, and that she was a thoroughly honest and devoted servant.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBesides,\u201d he added, \u201cat five o\u2019clock Monsieur Stangerson went into the\r\n\r\n      room to fetch his daughter\u2019s hat.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is that also,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat the man entered by the window at the time you say, I admit,\u201d I said;\r\n\r\n      \u201cbut why did he shut the window? It was an act which would necessarily\r\n\r\n      draw the attention of those who had left it open.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt may be the window was not shut at once,\u201d replied the young reporter.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut if he did shut the window, it was because of the bend in the gravel\r\n\r\n      path, a dozen yards from the pavilion, and on account of the three oaks\r\n\r\n      that are growing at that spot.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d asked Monsieur Darzac, who had followed us and\r\n\r\n      listened with almost breathless attention to all that Rouletabille had\r\n\r\n      said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll explain all to you later on, Monsieur, when I think the moment to be\r\n\r\n      ripe for doing so; but I don\u2019t think I have anything of more importance to\r\n\r\n      say on this affair, if my hypothesis is justified.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what is your hypothesis?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will never know if it does not turn out to be the truth. It is of\r\n\r\n      much too grave a nature to speak of it, so long as it continues to be only\r\n\r\n      a hypothesis.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you, at least, some idea as to who the murderer is?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, monsieur, I don\u2019t know who the murderer is; but don\u2019t be afraid,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2014I shall know.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I could not but observe that Monsieur Darzac was deeply moved; and I\r\n\r\n      suspected that Rouletabille\u2019s confident assertion was not pleasing to him.\r\n\r\n      Why, I asked myself, if he was really afraid that the murderer should be\r\n\r\n      discovered, was he helping the reporter to find him? My young friend\r\n\r\n      seemed to have received the same impression, for he said, bluntly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac, don\u2019t you want me to find out who the murderer was?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh!\u2014I should like to kill him with my own hand!\u201d cried Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s fiance, with a vehemence that amazed me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Rouletabille gravely; \u201cbut you have not answered my\r\n\r\n      question.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were passing by the thicket, of which the young reporter had spoken to\r\n\r\n      us a minute before. I entered it and pointed out evident traces of a man\r\n\r\n      who had been hidden there. Rouletabille, once more, was right.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes!\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do with a thing of flesh and blood, who\r\n\r\n      uses the same means that we do. It\u2019ll all come out on those lines.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Having said this, he asked me for the paper pattern of the footprint which\r\n\r\n      he had given me to take care of, and applied it to a very clear footmark\r\n\r\n      behind the thicket. \u201cAha!\u201d he said, rising.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I thought he was now going to trace back the track of the murderer\u2019s\r\n\r\n      footmarks to the vestibule window; but he led us instead, far to the left,\r\n\r\n      saying that it was useless ferreting in the mud, and that he was sure,\r\n\r\n      now, of the road taken by the murderer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe went along the wall to the hedge and dry ditch, over which he jumped.\r\n\r\n      See, just in front of the little path leading to the lake, that was his\r\n\r\n      nearest way to get out.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you know he went to the lake?\u201d\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause Frederic Larsan has not quitted the borders of it since this\r\n\r\n      morning. There must be some important marks there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A few minutes later we reached the lake.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was a little sheet of marshy water, surrounded by reeds, on which\r\n\r\n      floated some dead water-lily leaves. The great Fred may have seen us\r\n\r\n      approaching, but we probably interested him very little, for he took\r\n\r\n      hardly any notice of us and continued to be stirring with his cane\r\n\r\n      something which we could not see.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook!\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201chere again are the footmarks of the escaping\r\n\r\n      man; they skirt the lake here and finally disappear just before this path,\r\n\r\n      which leads to the high road to Epinay. The man continued his flight to\r\n\r\n      Paris.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d I asked, \u201csince these footmarks are not\r\n\r\n      continued on the path?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat makes me think that?\u2014Why these footprints, which I expected to\r\n\r\n      find!\u201d he cried, pointing to the sharply outlined imprint of a neat boot.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSee!\u201d\u2014and he called to Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Fred, these neat footprints seem to have been made since the\r\n\r\n      discovery of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, young man, yes, they have been carefully made,\u201d replied Fred without\r\n\r\n      raising his head. \u201cYou see, there are steps that come, and steps that go\r\n\r\n      back.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the man had a bicycle!\u201d cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here, after looking at the marks of the bicycle, which followed, going and\r\n\r\n      coming, the neat footprints, I thought I might intervene.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe bicycle explains the disappearance of the murderer\u2019s big\r\n\r\n      foot-prints,\u201d I said. \u201cThe murderer, with his rough boots, mounted a\r\n\r\n      bicycle. His accomplice, the wearer of the neat boots, had come to wait\r\n\r\n      for him on the edge of the lake with the bicycle. It might be supposed\r\n\r\n      that the murderer was working for the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no!\u201d replied Rouletabille with a strange smile. \u201cI have expected to\r\n\r\n      find these footmarks from the very beginning. These are not the footmarks\r\n\r\n      of the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen there were two?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo\u2014there was but one, and he had no accomplice.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good!\u2014Very good!\u201d cried Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLook!\u201d continued the young reporter, showing us the ground where it had\r\n\r\n      been disturbed by big and heavy heels; \u201cthe man seated himself there, and\r\n\r\n      took off his hobnailed boots, which he had worn only for the purpose of\r\n\r\n      misleading detection, and then no doubt, taking them away with him, he\r\n\r\n      stood up in his own boots, and quietly and slowly regained the high road,\r\n\r\n      holding his bicycle in his hand, for he could not venture to ride it on\r\n\r\n      this rough path. That accounts for the lightness of the impression made by\r\n\r\n      the wheels along it, in spite of the softness of the ground. If there had\r\n\r\n      been a man on the bicycle, the wheels would have sunk deeply into the\r\n\r\n      soil. No, no; there was but one man there, the murderer on foot.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBravo!\u2014bravo!\u201d cried Fred again, and coming suddenly towards us\r\n\r\n      and, planting himself in front of Monsieur Robert Darzac, he said to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we had a bicycle here, we might demonstrate the correctness of the\r\n\r\n      young man\u2019s reasoning, Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do you know whether there\r\n\r\n      is one at the chateau?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo!\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac. \u201cThere is not. I took mine, four days ago,\r\n\r\n      to Paris, the last time I came to the chateau before the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a pity!\u201d replied Fred, very coldly. Then, turning to Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      he said: \u201cIf we go on at this rate, we\u2019ll both come to the same\r\n\r\n      conclusion. Have you any idea, as to how the murderer got away from The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d said my young friend; \u201cI have an idea.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo have I,\u201d said Fred, \u201cand it must be the same as yours. There are no\r\n\r\n      two ways of reasoning in this affair. I am waiting for the arrival of my\r\n\r\n      chief before offering any explanation to the examining magistrate.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! Is the Chief of the Surete coming?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, this afternoon. He is going to summon, before the magistrate, in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory, all those who have played any part in this tragedy. It will be\r\n\r\n      very interesting. It is a pity you won\u2019t be able to be present.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall be present,\u201d said Rouletabille confidently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cReally\u2014you are an extraordinary fellow\u2014for your age!\u201d replied\r\n\r\n      the detective in a tone not wholly free from irony. \u201cYou\u2019d make a\r\n\r\n      wonderful detective\u2014if you had a little more method\u2014if you\r\n\r\n      didn\u2019t follow your instincts and that bump on your forehead. As I have\r\n\r\n      already several times observed, Monsieur Rouletabille, you reason too\r\n\r\n      much; you do not allow yourself to be guided by what you have seen. What\r\n\r\n      do you say to the handkerchief full of blood, and the red mark of the hand\r\n\r\n      on the wall? You have seen the stain on the wall, but I have only seen the\r\n\r\n      handkerchief.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBah!\u201d cried Rouletabille, \u201cthe murderer was wounded in the hand by\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s revolver!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u2014a simply instinctive observation! Take care!\u2014You are\r\n\r\n      becoming too strictly logical, Monsieur Rouletabille; logic will upset you\r\n\r\n      if you use it indiscriminately. You are right, when you say that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson fired her revolver, but you are wrong when you say\r\n\r\n      that she wounded the murderer in the hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure of it,\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Fred, imperturbable, interrupted him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDefective observation\u2014defective observation!\u2014the examination\r\n\r\n      of the handkerchief, the numberless little round scarlet stains, the\r\n\r\n      impression of drops which I found in the tracks of the footprints, at the\r\n\r\n      moment when they were made on the floor, prove to me that the murderer was\r\n\r\n      not wounded at all. Monsieur Rouletabille, the murderer bled at the nose!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The great Fred spoke quite seriously. However, I could not refrain from\r\n\r\n      uttering an exclamation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reporter looked gravely at Fred, who looked gravely at him. And Fred\r\n\r\n      immediately concluded:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man allowed the blood to flow into his hand and handkerchief, and\r\n\r\n      dried his hand on the wall. The fact is highly important,\u201d he added,\r\n\r\n      \u201cbecause there is no need of his being wounded in the hand for him to be\r\n\r\n      the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille seemed to be thinking deeply. After a moment he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is something\u2014a something, Monsieur Frederic Larsan, much\r\n\r\n      graver than the misuse of logic the disposition of mind in some detectives\r\n\r\n      which makes them, in perfect good faith, twist logic to the necessities of\r\n\r\n      their preconceived ideas. You, already, have your idea about the murderer,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Fred. Don\u2019t deny it; and your theory demands that the murderer\r\n\r\n      should not have been wounded in the hand, otherwise it comes to nothing.\r\n\r\n      And you have searched, and have found something else. It\u2019s dangerous, very\r\n\r\n      dangerous, Monsieur Fred, to go from a preconceived idea to find the\r\n\r\n      proofs to fit it. That method may lead you far astray Beware of judicial\r\n\r\n      error, Monsieur Fred, it will trip you up!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And laughing a little, in a slightly bantering tone, his hands in his\r\n\r\n      pockets, Rouletabille fixed his cunning eyes on the great Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan silently contemplated the young reporter who pretended to\r\n\r\n      be as wise as himself. Shrugging his shoulders, he bowed to us and moved\r\n\r\n      quickly away, hitting the stones on his path with his stout cane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille watched his retreat, and then turned toward us, his face\r\n\r\n      joyous and triumphant.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall beat him!\u201d he cried. \u201cI shall beat the great Fred, clever as he\r\n\r\n      is; I shall beat them all!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he danced a double shuffle. Suddenly he stopped. My eyes followed his\r\n\r\n      gaze; they were fixed on Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was looking anxiously\r\n\r\n      at the impression left by his feet side by side with the elegant\r\n\r\n      footmarks. There was not a particle of difference between them!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We thought he was about to faint. His eyes, bulging with terror, avoided\r\n\r\n      us, while his right hand, with a spasmodic movement, twitched at the beard\r\n\r\n      that covered his honest, gentle, and now despairing face. At length\r\n\r\n      regaining his self-possession, he bowed to us, and remarking, in a changed\r\n\r\n      voice, that he was obliged to return to the chateau, left us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe deuce!\u201d exclaimed Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He, also, appeared to be deeply concerned. From his pocket-book he took a\r\n\r\n      piece of white paper as I had seen him do before, and with his scissors,\r\n\r\n      cut out the shape of the neat bootmarks that were on the ground. Then he\r\n\r\n      fitted the new paper pattern with the one he had previously made\u2014the\r\n\r\n      two were exactly alike. Rising, Rouletabille exclaimed again: \u201cThe deuce!\u201d\r\n\r\n       Presently he added: \u201cYet I believe Monsieur Robert Darzac to be an honest\r\n\r\n      man.\u201d He then led me on the road to the Donjon Inn, which we could see on\r\n\r\n      the highway, by the side of a small clump of trees.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER X. \u201cWe Shall Have to Eat Red Meat\u2014Now\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Donjon Inn was of no imposing appearance; but I like these buildings\r\n\r\n      with their rafters blackened with age and the smoke of their hearths\u2014these\r\n\r\n      inns of the coaching-days, crumbling erections that will soon exist in the\r\n\r\n      memory only. They belong to the bygone days, they are linked with history.\r\n\r\n      They make us think of the Road, of those days when highwaymen rode.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I saw at once that the Donjon Inn was at least two centuries old\u2014perhaps\r\n\r\n      older. Under its sign-board, over the threshold, a man with a\r\n\r\n      crabbed-looking face was standing, seemingly plunged in unpleasant\r\n\r\n      thought, if the wrinkles on his forehead and the knitting of his brows\r\n\r\n      were any indication.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When we were close to him, he deigned to see us and asked us, in a tone\r\n\r\n      anything but engaging, whether we wanted anything. He was, no doubt, the\r\n\r\n      not very amiable landlord of this charming dwelling-place. As we expressed\r\n\r\n      a hope that he would be good enough to furnish us with a breakfast, he\r\n\r\n      assured us that he had no provisions, regarding us, as he said this, with\r\n\r\n      a look that was unmistakably suspicious.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou may take us in,\u201d Rouletabille said to him, \u201cwe are not policemen.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the police\u2014I\u2019m not afraid of anyone!\u201d replied the\r\n\r\n      man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I had made my friend understand by a sign that we should do better not to\r\n\r\n      insist; but, being determined to enter the inn, he slipped by the man on\r\n\r\n      the doorstep and was in the common room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201cit is very comfortable here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A good fire was blazing in the chimney, and we held our hands to the\r\n\r\n      warmth it sent out; it was a morning in which the approach of winter was\r\n\r\n      unmistakable. The room was a tolerably large one, furnished with two heavy\r\n\r\n      tables, some stools, a counter decorated with rows of bottles of syrup and\r\n\r\n      alcohol. Three windows looked out on to the road. A coloured advertisement\r\n\r\n      lauded the many merits of a new vermouth. On the mantelpiece was arrayed\r\n\r\n      the innkeeper\u2019s collection of figured earthenware pots and stone jugs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a fine fire for roasting a chicken,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cWe have\r\n\r\n      no chicken\u2014not even a wretched rabbit,\u201d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know,\u201d said my friend slowly; \u201cI know\u2014We shall have to eat red\r\n\r\n      meat\u2014now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I confess I did not in the least understand what Rouletabille meant by\r\n\r\n      what he had said; but the landlord, as soon as he heard the words, uttered\r\n\r\n      an oath, which he at once stifled, and placed himself at our orders as\r\n\r\n      obediently as Monsieur Robert Darzac had done, when he heard\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s prophetic sentence\u2014\u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing\r\n\r\n      of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.\u201d Certainly my friend knew how\r\n\r\n      to make people understand him by the use of wholly incomprehensible\r\n\r\n      phrases. I observed as much to him, but he merely smiled. I should have\r\n\r\n      proposed that he give me some explanation; but he put a finger to his\r\n\r\n      lips, which evidently signified that he had not only determined not to\r\n\r\n      speak, but also enjoined silence on my part.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Meantime the man had pushed open a little side door and called to somebody\r\n\r\n      to bring him half a dozen eggs and a piece of beefsteak. The commission\r\n\r\n      was quickly executed by a strongly-built young woman with beautiful blonde\r\n\r\n      hair and large, handsome eyes, who regarded us with curiosity.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The innkeeper said to her roughly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGet out!\u2014and if the Green Man comes, don\u2019t let me see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She disappeared. Rouletabille took the eggs, which had been brought to him\r\n\r\n      in a bowl, and the meat which was on a dish, placed all carefully beside\r\n\r\n      him in the chimney, unhooked a frying-pan and a gridiron, and began to\r\n\r\n      beat up our omelette before proceeding to grill our beefsteak. He then\r\n\r\n      ordered two bottles of cider, and seemed to take as little notice of our\r\n\r\n      host as our host did of him. The landlord let us do our own cooking and\r\n\r\n      set our table near one of the windows.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly I heard him mutter:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u2014there he is.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      His face had changed, expressing fierce hatred. He went and glued himself\r\n\r\n      to one of the windows, watching the road. There was no need for me to draw\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s attention; he had already left our omelette and had joined\r\n\r\n      the landlord at the window. I went with him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      A man dressed entirely in green velvet, his head covered with a huntsman\u2019s\r\n\r\n      cap of the same colour, was advancing leisurely, lighting a pipe as he\r\n\r\n      walked. He carried a fowling-piece slung at his back. His movements\r\n\r\n      displayed an almost aristocratic ease. He wore eye-glasses and appeared to\r\n\r\n      be about five and forty years of age. His hair as well as his moustache\r\n\r\n      were salt grey. He was remarkably handsome. As he passed near the inn, he\r\n\r\n      hesitated, as if asking himself whether or no he should enter it; gave a\r\n\r\n      glance towards us, took a few whiffs at his pipe, and then resumed his\r\n\r\n      walk at the same nonchalant pace.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and I looked at our host. His flashing eyes, his clenched\r\n\r\n      hands, his trembling lips, told us of the tumultuous feelings by which he\r\n\r\n      was being agitated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe has done well not to come in here to-day!\u201d he hissed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho is that man?\u201d asked Rouletabille, returning to his omelette.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Green Man,\u201d growled the innkeeper. \u201cDon\u2019t you know him? Then all the\r\n\r\n      better for you. He is not an acquaintance to make.\u2014Well, he is\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s forest-keeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t appear to like him very much?\u201d asked the reporter, pouring his\r\n\r\n      omelette into the frying-pan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNobody likes him, monsieur. He\u2019s an upstart who must once have had a\r\n\r\n      fortune of his own; and he forgives nobody because, in order to live, he\r\n\r\n      has been compelled to become a servant. A keeper is as much a servant as\r\n\r\n      any other, isn\u2019t he? Upon my word, one would say that he is the master of\r\n\r\n      the Glandier, and that all the land and woods belong to him. He\u2019ll not let\r\n\r\n      a poor creature eat a morsel of bread on the grass\u2014his grass!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoes he often come here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cToo often. But I\u2019ve made him understand that his face doesn\u2019t please me,\r\n\r\n      and, for a month past, he hasn\u2019t been here. The Donjon Inn has never\r\n\r\n      existed for him!\u2014he hasn\u2019t had time!\u2014been too much engaged in\r\n\r\n      paying court to the landlady of the Three Lilies at Saint-Michel. A bad\r\n\r\n      fellow!\u2014There isn\u2019t an honest man who can bear him. Why, the\r\n\r\n      concierges of the chateau would turn their eyes away from a picture of\r\n\r\n      him!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe concierges of the chateau are honest people, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, they are, as true as my name\u2019s Mathieu, monsieur. I believe them to\r\n\r\n      be honest.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYet they\u2019ve been arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does that prove?\u2014But I don\u2019t want to mix myself up in other\r\n\r\n      people\u2019s affairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what do you think of the murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf the murder of poor Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u2014A good girl much\r\n\r\n      loved everywhere in the country. That\u2019s what I think of it\u2014and many\r\n\r\n      things besides; but that\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot even mine?\u201d insisted Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The innkeeper looked at him sideways and said gruffly:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot even yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The omelette ready, we sat down at table and were silently eating, when\r\n\r\n      the door was pushed open and an old woman, dressed in rags, leaning on a\r\n\r\n      stick, her head doddering, her white hair hanging loosely over her\r\n\r\n      wrinkled forehead, appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u2014there you are, Mother Angenoux!\u2014It\u2019s long since we saw\r\n\r\n      you last,\u201d said our host.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have been very ill, very nearly dying,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cIf ever\r\n\r\n      you should have any scraps for the Bete du Bon Dieu\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And she entered, followed by a cat, larger than any I had ever believed\r\n\r\n      could exist. The beast looked at us and gave so hopeless a miau that I\r\n\r\n      shuddered. I had never heard so lugubrious a cry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As if drawn by the cat\u2019s cry a man followed the old woman in. It was the\r\n\r\n      Green Man. He saluted by raising his hand to his cap and seated himself at\r\n\r\n      a table near to ours.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA glass of cider, Daddy Mathieu,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As the Green Man entered, Daddy Mathieu had started violently; but visibly\r\n\r\n      mastering himself he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve no more cider; I served the last bottles to these gentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen give me a glass of white wine,\u201d said the Green Man, without showing\r\n\r\n      the least surprise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve no more white wine\u2014no more anything,\u201d said Daddy Mathieu,\r\n\r\n      surlily.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow is Madame Mathieu?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite well, thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      So the young Woman with the large, tender eyes, whom we had just seen, was\r\n\r\n      the wife of this repugnant and brutal rustic, whose jealousy seemed to\r\n\r\n      emphasise his physical ugliness.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Slamming the door behind him, the innkeeper left the room. Mother Angenoux\r\n\r\n      was still standing, leaning on her stick, the cat at her feet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ve been ill, Mother Angenoux?\u2014Is that why we have not seen you\r\n\r\n      for the last week?\u201d asked the Green Man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur keeper. I have been able to get up but three times, to go\r\n\r\n      to pray to Sainte-Genevieve, our good patroness, and the rest of the time\r\n\r\n      I have been lying on my bed. There was no one to care for me but the Bete\r\n\r\n      du bon Dieu!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid she not leave you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNeither by day nor by night.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs I am of Paradise.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen how was it, Madame Angenoux, that all through the night of the\r\n\r\n      murder nothing but the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu was heard?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mother Angenoux planted herself in front of the forest-keeper and struck\r\n\r\n      the floor with her stick.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut shall I tell you\r\n\r\n      something? There are no two cats in the world that cry like that. Well, on\r\n\r\n      the night of the murder I also heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu\r\n\r\n      outside; and yet she was on my knees, and did not mew once, I swear. I\r\n\r\n      crossed myself when I heard that, as if I had heard the devil.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I looked at the keeper when he put the last question, and I am much\r\n\r\n      mistaken if I did not detect an evil smile on his lips. At that moment,\r\n\r\n      the noise of loud quarrelling reached us. We even thought we heard a dull\r\n\r\n      sound of blows, as if some one was being beaten. The Green Man quickly\r\n\r\n      rose and hurried to the door by the side of the fireplace; but it was\r\n\r\n      opened by the landlord who appeared, and said to the keeper:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t alarm yourself, Monsieur\u2014it is my wife; she has the\r\n\r\n      toothache.\u201d And he laughed. \u201cHere, Mother Angenoux, here are some scraps\r\n\r\n      for your cat.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He held out a packet to the old woman, who took it eagerly and went out by\r\n\r\n      the door, closely followed by her cat.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you won\u2019t serve me?\u201d asked the Green Man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Mathieu\u2019s face was placid and no longer retained its expression of\r\n\r\n      hatred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ve nothing for you\u2014nothing for you. Take yourself off.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Green Man quietly refilled his pipe, lit it, bowed to us, and went\r\n\r\n      out. No sooner was he over the threshold than Daddy Mathieu slammed the\r\n\r\n      door after him and, turning towards us, with eyes bloodshot, and frothing\r\n\r\n      at the mouth, he hissed to us, shaking his clenched fist at the door he\r\n\r\n      had just shut on the man he evidently hated:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are who tell me \u2018We shall have to eat red meat\u2014now\u2019;\r\n\r\n      but if it will interest you to know it\u2014that man is the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      With which words Daddy Mathieu immediately left us. Rouletabille returned\r\n\r\n      towards the fireplace and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow we\u2019ll grill our steak. How do you like the cider?\u2014It\u2019s a little\r\n\r\n      tart, but I like it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We saw no more of Daddy Mathieu that day, and absolute silence reigned in\r\n\r\n      the inn when we left it, after placing five francs on the table in payment\r\n\r\n      for our feast.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille at once set off on a three mile walk round Professor\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s estate. He halted for some ten minutes at the corner of a\r\n\r\n      narrow road black with soot, near to some charcoal-burners\u2019 huts in the\r\n\r\n      forest of Sainte-Genevieve, which touches on the road from Epinay to\r\n\r\n      Corbeil, to tell me that the murderer had certainly passed that way,\r\n\r\n      before entering the grounds and concealing himself in the little clump of\r\n\r\n      trees.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t think, then, that the keeper knows anything of it?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe shall see that, later,\u201d he replied. \u201cFor the present I\u2019m not\r\n\r\n      interested in what the landlord said about the man. The landlord hates\r\n\r\n      him. I didn\u2019t take you to breakfast at the Donjon Inn for the sake of the\r\n\r\n      Green Man.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then Rouletabille, with great precaution glided, followed by me, towards\r\n\r\n      the little building which, standing near the park gate, served for the\r\n\r\n      home of the concierges, who had been arrested that morning. With the skill\r\n\r\n      of an acrobat, he got into the lodge by an upper window which had been\r\n\r\n      left open, and returned ten minutes later. He said only, \u201cAh!\u201d\u2014a\r\n\r\n      word which, in his mouth, signified many things.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were about to take the road leading to the chateau, when a considerable\r\n\r\n      stir at the park gate attracted our attention. A carriage had arrived and\r\n\r\n      some people had come from the chateau to meet it. Rouletabille pointed out\r\n\r\n      to me a gentleman who descended from it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s the Chief of the Surete\u201d he said. \u201cNow we shall see what Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan has up his sleeve, and whether he is so much cleverer than anybody\r\n\r\n      else.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The carriage of the Chief of the Surete was followed by three other\r\n\r\n      vehicles containing reporters, who were also desirous of entering the\r\n\r\n      park. But two gendarmes stationed at the gate had evidently received\r\n\r\n      orders to refuse admission to anybody. The Chief of the Surete calmed\r\n\r\n      their impatience by undertaking to furnish to the press, that evening, all\r\n\r\n      the information he could give that would not interfere with the judicial\r\n\r\n      inquiry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XI. In Which Frederic Larsan Explains How the Murderer Was Able to\r\n\r\n      Get Out of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Among the mass of papers, legal documents, memoirs, and extracts from\r\n\r\n      newspapers, which I have collected, relating to the mystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room, there is one very interesting piece; it is a detail of the famous\r\n\r\n      examination which took place that afternoon, in the laboratory of\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson, before the Chief of the Surete. This narrative is\r\n\r\n      from the pen of Monsieur Maleine, the Registrar, who, like the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate, had spent some of his leisure time in the pursuit of\r\n\r\n      literature. The piece was to have made part of a book which, however, has\r\n\r\n      never been published, and which was to have been entitled: \u201cMy\r\n\r\n      Examinations.\u201d It was given to me by the Registrar himself, some time\r\n\r\n      after the astonishing denouement to this case, and is unique in judicial\r\n\r\n      chronicles.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here it is. It is not a mere dry transcription of questions and answers,\r\n\r\n      because the Registrar often intersperses his story with his own personal\r\n\r\n      comments.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The examining magistrate and I (the writer relates) found ourselves in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room in the company of the builder who had constructed the pavilion\r\n\r\n      after Professor Stangerson\u2019s designs. He had a workman with him. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      de Marquet had had the walls laid entirely bare; that is to say, he had\r\n\r\n      had them stripped of the paper which had decorated them. Blows with a\r\n\r\n      pick, here and there, satisfied us of the absence of any sort of opening.\r\n\r\n      The floor and the ceiling were thoroughly sounded. We found nothing. There\r\n\r\n      was nothing to be found. Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be delighted and\r\n\r\n      never ceased repeating:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat a case! What a case! We shall never know, you\u2019ll see, how the\r\n\r\n      murderer was able to get out of this room!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then suddenly, with a radiant face, he called to the officer in charge of\r\n\r\n      the gendarmes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGo to the chateau,\u201d he said, \u201cand request Monsieur Stangerson and\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac to come to me in the laboratory, also Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques; and let your men bring here the two concierges.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Five minutes later all were assembled in the laboratory. The Chief of the\r\n\r\n      Surete, who had arrived at the Glandier, joined us at that moment. I was\r\n\r\n      seated at Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s desk ready for work, when Monsieur de\r\n\r\n      Marquet made us the following little speech\u2014as original as it was\r\n\r\n      unexpected:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith your permission, gentlemen\u2014as examinations lead to nothing\u2014we\r\n\r\n      will, for once, abandon the old system of interrogation. I will not have\r\n\r\n      you brought before me one by one, but we will all remain here as we are,\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, Monsieur Robert Darzac, Daddy Jacques and the two concierges,\r\n\r\n      the Chief of the Surete, the Registrar, and myself. We shall all be on the\r\n\r\n      same footing. The concierges may, for the moment, forget that they have\r\n\r\n      been arrested. We are going to confer together. We are on the spot where\r\n\r\n      the crime was committed. We have nothing else to discuss but the crime. So\r\n\r\n      let us discuss it freely\u2014intelligently or otherwise, so long as we\r\n\r\n      speak just what is in our minds. There need be no formality or method\r\n\r\n      since this won\u2019t help us in any way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then, passing before me, he said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you think of that, eh? What a scene! Could you have thought of\r\n\r\n      that? I\u2019ll make a little piece out of it for the Vaudeville.\u201d And he\r\n\r\n      rubbed his hands with glee.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I turned my eyes on Monsieur Stangerson. The hope he had received from the\r\n\r\n      doctor\u2019s latest reports, which stated that Mademoiselle Stangerson might\r\n\r\n      recover from her wounds, had not been able to efface from his noble\r\n\r\n      features the marks of the great sorrow that was upon him. He had believed\r\n\r\n      his daughter to be dead, and he was still broken by that belief. His\r\n\r\n      clear, soft, blue eyes expressed infinite sorrow. I had had occasion, many\r\n\r\n      times, to see Monsieur Stangerson at public ceremonies, and from the first\r\n\r\n      had been struck by his countenance, which seemed as pure as that of a\r\n\r\n      child\u2014the dreamy gaze with the sublime and mystical expression of\r\n\r\n      the inventor and thinker.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On those occasions his daughter was always to be seen either following him\r\n\r\n      or by his side; for they never quitted each other, it was said, and had\r\n\r\n      shared the same labours for many years. The young lady, who was then five\r\n\r\n      and thirty, though she looked no more than thirty, had devoted herself\r\n\r\n      entirely to science. She still won admiration for her imperial beauty\r\n\r\n      which had remained intact, without a wrinkle, withstanding time and love.\r\n\r\n      Who would have dreamed that I should one day be seated by her pillow with\r\n\r\n      my papers, and that I should see her, on the point of death, painfully\r\n\r\n      recounting to us the most monstrous and most mysterious crime I have heard\r\n\r\n      of in my career? Who would have thought that I should be, that afternoon,\r\n\r\n      listening to the despairing father vainly trying to explain how his\r\n\r\n      daughter\u2019s assailant had been able to escape from him? Why bury ourselves\r\n\r\n      with our work in obscure retreats in the depths of woods, if it may not\r\n\r\n      protect us against those dangerous threats to life which meet us in the\r\n\r\n      busy cities?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, Monsieur Stangerson,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet, with somewhat of an\r\n\r\n      important air, \u201cplace yourself exactly where you were when Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson left you to go to her chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson rose and, standing at a certain distance from the door\r\n\r\n      of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, said, in an even voice and without the least trace of\r\n\r\n      emphasis\u2014a voice which I can only describe as a dead voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was here. About eleven o\u2019clock, after I had made a brief chemical\r\n\r\n      experiment at the furnaces of the laboratory, needing all the space behind\r\n\r\n      me, I had my desk moved here by Daddy Jacques, who spent the evening in\r\n\r\n      cleaning some of my apparatus. My daughter had been working at the same\r\n\r\n      desk with me. When it was her time to leave she rose, kissed me, and bade\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques goodnight. She had to pass behind my desk and the door to\r\n\r\n      enter her chamber, and she could do this only with some difficulty. That\r\n\r\n      is to say, I was very near the place where the crime occurred later.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the desk?\u201d I asked, obeying, in thus mixing myself in the\r\n\r\n      conversation, the express orders of my chief, \u201cas soon as you heard the\r\n\r\n      cry of \u2018murder\u2019 followed by the revolver shots, what became of the desk?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques answered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe pushed it back against the wall, here\u2014close to where it is at\r\n\r\n      the present moment\u2014so as to be able to get at the door at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I followed up my reasoning, to which, however, I attached but little\r\n\r\n      importance, regarding it as only a weak hypothesis, with another question.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMight not a man in the room, the desk being so near to the door, by\r\n\r\n      stooping and slipping under the desk, have left it unobserved?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are forgetting,\u201d interrupted Monsieur Stangerson wearily, \u201cthat my\r\n\r\n      daughter had locked and bolted her door, that the door had remained\r\n\r\n      fastened, that we vainly tried to force it open when we heard the noise,\r\n\r\n      and that we were at the door while the struggle between the murderer and\r\n\r\n      my poor child was going on\u2014immediately after we heard her stifled\r\n\r\n      cries as she was being held by the fingers that have left their red mark\r\n\r\n      upon her throat. Rapid as the attack was, we were no less rapid in our\r\n\r\n      endeavors to get into the room where the tragedy was taking place.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I rose from my seat and once more examined the door with the greatest\r\n\r\n      care. Then I returned to my place with a despairing gesture.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf the lower panel of the door,\u201d I said, \u201ccould be removed without the\r\n\r\n      whole door being necessarily opened, the problem would be solved. But,\r\n\r\n      unfortunately, that last hypothesis is untenable after an examination of\r\n\r\n      the door\u2014it\u2019s of oak, solid and massive. You can see that quite\r\n\r\n      plainly, in spite of the injury done in the attempt to burst it open.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d cried Daddy Jacques, \u201cit is an old and solid door that was brought\r\n\r\n      from the chateau\u2014they don\u2019t make such doors now. We had to use this\r\n\r\n      bar of iron to get it open, all four of us\u2014for the concierge, brave\r\n\r\n      woman she is, helped us. It pains me to find them both in prison now.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques had no sooner uttered these words of pity and protestation\r\n\r\n      than tears and lamentations broke out from the concierges. I never saw two\r\n\r\n      accused people crying more bitterly. I was extremely disgusted. Even if\r\n\r\n      they were innocent, I could not understand how they could behave like that\r\n\r\n      in the face of misfortune. A dignified bearing at such times is better\r\n\r\n      than tears and groans, which, most often, are feigned.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow then, enough of that sniveling,\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet; \u201cand, in\r\n\r\n      your interest, tell us what you were doing under the windows of the\r\n\r\n      pavilion at the time your mistress was being attacked; for you were close\r\n\r\n      to the pavilion when Daddy Jacques met you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe were coming to help!\u201d they whined.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we could only lay hands on the murderer, he\u2019d never taste bread\r\n\r\n      again!\u201d the woman gurgled between her sobs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As before we were unable to get two connecting thoughts out of them. They\r\n\r\n      persisted in their denials and swore, by heaven and all the saints, that\r\n\r\n      they were in bed when they heard the sound of the revolver shot.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was not one, but two shots that were fired!\u2014You see, you are\r\n\r\n      lying. If you had heard one, you would have heard the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMon Dieu! Monsieur\u2014it was the second shot we heard. We were asleep\r\n\r\n      when the first shot was fired.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwo shots were fired,\u201d said Daddy Jacques. \u201cI am certain that all the\r\n\r\n      cartridges were in my revolver. We found afterward that two had been\r\n\r\n      exploded, and we heard two shots behind the door. Was not that so,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Professor, \u201cthere were two shots, one dull, and the\r\n\r\n      other sharp and ringing.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy do you persist in lying?\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet, turning to the\r\n\r\n      concierges. \u201cDo you think the police are the fools you are? Everything\r\n\r\n      points to the fact that you were out of doors and near the pavilion at the\r\n\r\n      time of the tragedy. What were you doing there? So far as I am concerned,\u201d\r\n\r\n       he said, turning to Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cI can only explain the escape of\r\n\r\n      the murderer on the assumption of help from these two accomplices. As soon\r\n\r\n      as the door was forced open, and while you, Monsieur Stangerson, were\r\n\r\n      occupied with your unfortunate child, the concierge and his wife\r\n\r\n      facilitated the flight of the murderer, who, screening himself behind\r\n\r\n      them, reached the window in the vestibule, and sprang out of it into the\r\n\r\n      park. The concierge closed the window after him and fastened the blinds,\r\n\r\n      which certainly could not have closed and fastened of themselves. That is\r\n\r\n      the conclusion I have arrived at. If anyone here has any other idea, let\r\n\r\n      him state it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson intervened:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat you say was impossible. I do not believe either in the guilt or in\r\n\r\n      the connivance of my concierges, though I cannot understand what they were\r\n\r\n      doing in the park at that late hour of the night. I say it was impossible,\r\n\r\n      because Madame Bernier held the lamp and did not move from the threshold\r\n\r\n      of the room; because I, as soon as the door was forced open, threw myself\r\n\r\n      on my knees beside my daughter, and no one could have left or entered the\r\n\r\n      room by the door, without passing over her body and forcing his way by me!\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques and the concierge had but to cast a glance round the chamber\r\n\r\n      and under the bed, as I had done on entering, to see that there was nobody\r\n\r\n      in it but my daughter lying on the floor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you think, Monsieur Darzac?\u201d asked the magistrate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac replied that he had no opinion to express. Monsieur Dax,\r\n\r\n      the Chief of the Surete who, so far, had been listening and examining the\r\n\r\n      room, at length deigned to open his lips:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhile search is being made for the criminal, we had better try to find\r\n\r\n      out the motive for the crime; that will advance us a little,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n      Turning towards Monsieur Stangerson, he continued, in the even,\r\n\r\n      intelligent tone indicative of a strong character, \u201cI understand that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle was shortly to have been married?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The professor looked sadly at Monsieur Robert Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo my friend here, whom I should have been happy to call my son\u2014to\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson is much better and is rapidly recovering from her\r\n\r\n      wounds. The marriage is simply delayed, is it not, Monsieur?\u201d insisted the\r\n\r\n      Chief of the Surete.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope so.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! Is there any doubt about that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson did not answer. Monsieur Robert Darzac seemed\r\n\r\n      agitated. I saw that his hand trembled as it fingered his watchchain.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Dax coughed, as did Monsieur de Marquet. Both were evidently\r\n\r\n      embarrassed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou understand, Monsieur Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201cthat in an affair so\r\n\r\n      perplexing as this, we cannot neglect anything; we must know all, even the\r\n\r\n      smallest and seemingly most futile thing concerning the victim\u2014information\r\n\r\n      apparently the most insignificant. Why do you doubt that this marriage\r\n\r\n      will take place? You expressed a hope; but the hope implies a doubt. Why\r\n\r\n      do you doubt?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson made a visible effort to recover himself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou are right. It will be best that\r\n\r\n      you should know something which, if I concealed it, might appear to be of\r\n\r\n      importance; Monsieur Darzac agrees with me in this.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac, whose pallor at that moment seemed to me to be altogether\r\n\r\n      abnormal, made a sign of assent. I gathered he was unable to speak.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI want you to know then,\u201d continued Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cthat my\r\n\r\n      daughter has sworn never to leave me, and adheres firmly to her oath, in\r\n\r\n      spite of all my prayers and all that I have argued to induce her to marry.\r\n\r\n      We have known Monsieur Robert Darzac many years. He loves my child; and I\r\n\r\n      believed that she loved him; because she only recently consented to this\r\n\r\n      marriage which I desire with all my heart. I am an old man, Monsieur, and\r\n\r\n      it was a happy hour to me when I knew that, after I had gone, she would\r\n\r\n      have at her side, one who loved her and who would help her in continuing\r\n\r\n      our common labours. I love and esteem Monsieur Darzac both for his\r\n\r\n      greatness of heart and for his devotion to science. But, two days before\r\n\r\n      the tragedy, for I know not what reason, my daughter declared to me that\r\n\r\n      she would never marry Monsieur Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A dead silence followed Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s words. It was a moment\r\n\r\n      fraught with suspense.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid Mademoiselle give you any explanation,\u2014did she tell you what\r\n\r\n      her motive was?\u201d asked Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe told me she was too old to marry\u2014that she had waited too long.\r\n\r\n      She said she had given much thought to the matter and while she had a\r\n\r\n      great esteem, even affection, for Monsieur Darzac, she felt it would be\r\n\r\n      better if things remained as they were. She would be happy, she said, to\r\n\r\n      see the relations between ourselves and Monsieur Darzac become closer, but\r\n\r\n      only on the understanding that there would be no more talk of marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is very strange!\u201d muttered Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStrange!\u201d repeated Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll certainly not find the motive there, Monsieur Dax,\u201d Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson said with a cold smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn any case, the motive was not theft!\u201d said the Chief impatiently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! we are quite convinced of that!\u201d cried the examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment the door of the laboratory opened and the officer in charge\r\n\r\n      of the gendarmes entered and handed a card to the examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet read it and uttered a half angry exclamation:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is really too much!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the Chief.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s the card of a young reporter engaged on the \u2018Epoque,\u2019 a Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Joseph Rouletabille. It has these words written on it: \u2018One of the motives\r\n\r\n      of the crime was robbery.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Chief smiled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u2014young Rouletabille\u2014I\u2019ve heard of him he is considered\r\n\r\n      rather clever. Let him come in.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille was allowed to enter. I had made his\r\n\r\n      acquaintance in the train that morning on the way to Epinay-sur-Orge. He\r\n\r\n      had introduced himself almost against my wish into our compartment. I had\r\n\r\n      better say at once that his manners, and the arrogance with which he\r\n\r\n      assumed to know what was incomprehensible even to us, impressed him\r\n\r\n      unfavourably on my mind. I do not like journalists. They are a class of\r\n\r\n      writers to be avoided as the pest. They think that everything is\r\n\r\n      permissible and they respect nothing. Grant them the least favour, allow\r\n\r\n      them even to approach you, and you never can tell what annoyance they may\r\n\r\n      give you. This one appears to be scarcely twenty years old, and the\r\n\r\n      effrontery with which he dared to question us and discuss the matter with\r\n\r\n      us made him particularly obnoxious to me. Besides, he had a way of\r\n\r\n      expressing himself that left us guessing as to whether he was mocking us\r\n\r\n      or not. I know quite well that the \u2018Epoque\u2019 is an influential paper with\r\n\r\n      which it is well to be on good terms, but the paper ought not to allow\r\n\r\n      itself to be represented by sneaking reporters.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille entered the laboratory, bowed to us, and\r\n\r\n      waited for Monsieur de Marquet to ask him to explain his presence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou pretend, Monsieur, that you know the motive for the crime, and that\r\n\r\n      that motive\u2014in the face of all the evidence that has been\r\n\r\n      forthcoming\u2014was robbery?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur, I do not pretend that. I do not say that robbery was the\r\n\r\n      motive for the crime, and I don\u2019t believe it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, what is the meaning of this card?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt means that robbery was one of the motives for the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat leads you to think that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you will be good enough to accompany me, I will show you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The young man asked us to follow him into the vestibule, and we did. He\r\n\r\n      led us towards the lavatory and begged Monsieur de Marquet to kneel beside\r\n\r\n      him. This lavatory is lit by the glass door, and, when the door was open,\r\n\r\n      the light which penetrated was sufficient to light it perfectly. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      de Marquet and Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille knelt down on the threshold,\r\n\r\n      and the young man pointed to a spot on the pavement.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe stones of the lavatory have not been washed by Daddy Jacques for some\r\n\r\n      time,\u201d he said; \u201cthat can be seen by the layer of dust that covers them.\r\n\r\n      Now, notice here, the marks of two large footprints and the black ash they\r\n\r\n      left where they have been. That ash is nothing else than the charcoal dust\r\n\r\n      that covers the path along which you must pass through the forest, in\r\n\r\n      order to get directly from Epinay to the Glandier. You know there is a\r\n\r\n      little village of charcoal-burners at that place, who make large\r\n\r\n      quantities of charcoal. What the murderer did was to come here at midday,\r\n\r\n      when there was nobody at the pavilion, and attempt his robbery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what robbery?\u2014Where do you see any signs of robbery? What\r\n\r\n      proves to you that a robbery has been committed?\u201d we all cried at once.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat put me on the trace of it,\u201d continued the journalist...\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWas this?\u201d interrupted Monsieur de Marquet, still on his knees.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Monsieur de Marquet explained that there were on the dust of the\r\n\r\n      pavement marks of two footsteps, as well as the impression, freshly-made,\r\n\r\n      of a heavy rectangular parcel, the marks of the cord with which it had\r\n\r\n      been fastened being easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have been here, then, Monsieur Rouletabille? I thought I had given\r\n\r\n      orders to Daddy Jacques, who was left in charge of the pavilion, not to\r\n\r\n      allow anybody to enter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDon\u2019t scold Daddy Jacques, I came here with Monsieur Robert Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u2014Indeed!\u201d exclaimed Monsieur de Marquet, disagreeably, casting a\r\n\r\n      side-glance at Monsieur Darzac, who remained perfectly silent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I saw the mark of the parcel by the side of the footprints, I had no\r\n\r\n      doubt as to the robbery,\u201d replied Monsieur Rouletabille. \u201cThe thief had\r\n\r\n      not brought a parcel with him; he had made one here\u2014a parcel with\r\n\r\n      the stolen objects, no doubt; and he put it in this corner intending to\r\n\r\n      take it away when the moment came for him to make his escape. He had also\r\n\r\n      placed his heavy boots beside the parcel,\u2014for, see\u2014there are\r\n\r\n      no marks of steps leading to the marks left by the boots, which were\r\n\r\n      placed side by side. That accounts for the fact that the murderer left no\r\n\r\n      trace of his steps when he fled from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, nor any in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory, nor in the vestibule. After entering \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d in his\r\n\r\n      boots, he took them off, finding them troublesome, or because he wished to\r\n\r\n      make as little noise as possible. The marks made by him in going through\r\n\r\n      the vestibule and the laboratory were subsequently washed out by Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques. Having, for some reason or other, taken off his boots, the\r\n\r\n      murderer carried them in his hand and placed them by the side of the\r\n\r\n      parcel he had made,\u2014by that time the robbery had been accomplished.\r\n\r\n      The man then returned to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and slipped under the bed, where\r\n\r\n      the mark of his body is perfectly visible on the floor and even on the\r\n\r\n      mat, which has been slightly moved from its place and creased. Fragments\r\n\r\n      of straw also, recently torn, bear witness to the murderer\u2019s movements\r\n\r\n      under the bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, yes,\u2014we know all about that,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe robber had another motive for returning to hide under the bed,\u201d\r\n\r\n       continued the astonishing boy-journalist. \u201cYou might think that he was\r\n\r\n      trying to hide himself quickly on seeing, through the vestibule window,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson about to enter the pavilion. It would\r\n\r\n      have been much easier for him to have climbed up to the attic and hidden\r\n\r\n      there, waiting for an opportunity to get away, if his purpose had been\r\n\r\n      only flight.\u2014No! No!\u2014he had to be in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the Chief intervened.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s not at all bad, young man. I compliment you. If we do not know yet\r\n\r\n      how the murderer succeeded in getting away, we can at any rate see how he\r\n\r\n      came in and committed the robbery. But what did he steal?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSomething very valuable,\u201d replied the young reporter.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment we heard a cry from the laboratory. We rushed in and found\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson, his eyes haggard, his limbs trembling, pointing to a\r\n\r\n      sort of bookcase which he had opened, and which, we saw, was empty. At the\r\n\r\n      same instant he sank into the large armchair that was placed before the\r\n\r\n      desk and groaned, the tears rolling down his cheeks, \u201cI have been robbed\r\n\r\n      again! For God\u2019s sake, do not say a word of this to my daughter. She would\r\n\r\n      be more pained than I am.\u201d He heaved a deep sigh and added, in a tone I\r\n\r\n      shall never forget: \u201cAfter all, what does it matter,\u2014so long as she\r\n\r\n      lives!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe will live!\u201d said Monsieur Darzac, in a voice strangely touching.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd we will find the stolen articles,\u201d said Monsieur Dax. \u201cBut what was\r\n\r\n      in the cabinet?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwenty years of my life,\u201d replied the illustrious professor sadly, \u201cor\r\n\r\n      rather of our lives\u2014the lives of myself and my daughter! Yes, our\r\n\r\n      most precious documents, the records of our secret experiments and our\r\n\r\n      labours of twenty years were in that cabinet. It is an irreparable loss to\r\n\r\n      us and, I venture to say, to science. All the processes by which I had\r\n\r\n      been able to arrive at the precious proof of the destructibility of matter\r\n\r\n      were there\u2014all. The man who came wished to take all from me,\u2014my\r\n\r\n      daughter and my work\u2014my heart and my soul.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And the great scientist wept like a child.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We stood around him in silence, deeply affected by his great distress.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac pressed closely to his side, and tried in vain to restrain\r\n\r\n      his tears\u2014a sight which, for the moment, almost made me like him, in\r\n\r\n      spite of an instinctive repulsion which his strange demeanour and his\r\n\r\n      inexplicable anxiety had inspired me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Rouletabille alone,\u2014as if his precious time and mission on\r\n\r\n      earth did not permit him to dwell in the contemplation on human suffering\u2014had,\r\n\r\n      very calmly, stepped up to the empty cabinet and, pointing at it, broke\r\n\r\n      the almost solemn silence. He entered into explanations, for which there\r\n\r\n      was no need, as to why he had been led to believe that a robbery had been\r\n\r\n      committed, which included the simultaneous discovery he had made in the\r\n\r\n      lavatory, and the empty precious cabinet in the laboratory. The first\r\n\r\n      thing that had struck him, he said, was the unusual form of that piece of\r\n\r\n      furniture. It was very strongly built of fire-proof iron, clearly showing\r\n\r\n      that it was intended for the keeping of most valuable objects. Then he\r\n\r\n      noticed that the key had been left in the lock. \u201cOne does not ordinarily\r\n\r\n      have a safe and leave it open!\u201d he had said to himself. This little key,\r\n\r\n      with its brass head and complicated wards, had strongly attracted him,\u2014its\r\n\r\n      presence had suggested robbery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be greatly perplexed, as if he did not\r\n\r\n      know whether he ought to be glad of the new direction given to the inquiry\r\n\r\n      by the young reporter, or sorry that it had not been done by himself. In\r\n\r\n      our profession and for the general welfare, we have to put up with such\r\n\r\n      mortifications and bury selfish feelings. That was why Monsieur de Marquet\r\n\r\n      controlled himself and joined his compliments with those of Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n      As for Monsieur Rouletabille, he simply shrugged his shoulders and said:\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at all in that!\u201d I should have liked to box his ears,\r\n\r\n      especially when he added: \u201cYou will do well, Monsieur, to ask Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson who usually kept that key?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy daughter,\u201d replied Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cshe was never without it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! then that changes the aspect of things which no longer corresponds\r\n\r\n      with Monsieur Rouletabille\u2019s ideas!\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet. \u201cIf that\r\n\r\n      key never left Mademoiselle Stangerson, the murderer must have waited for\r\n\r\n      her in her room for the purpose of stealing it; and the robbery could not\r\n\r\n      have been committed until after the attack had been made on her. But after\r\n\r\n      the attack four persons were in the laboratory! I can\u2019t make it out!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe robbery,\u201d said the reporter, \u201ccould only have been committed before\r\n\r\n      the attack upon Mademoiselle Stangerson in her room. When the murderer\r\n\r\n      entered the pavilion he already possessed the brass-headed key.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is impossible,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson in a low voice.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is quite possible, Monsieur, as this proves.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And the young rascal drew a copy of the \u201cEpoque\u201d from his pocket, dated\r\n\r\n      the 21st of October (I recall the fact that the crime was committed on the\r\n\r\n      night between the 24th and 25th), and showing us an advertisement, he\r\n\r\n      read:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Yesterday a black satin reticule was lost in the Grands Magasins de la\r\n\r\n      Louvre. It contained, amongst other things, a small key with a brass head.\r\n\r\n      A handsome reward will be given to the person who has found it. This\r\n\r\n      person must write, poste restante, bureau 40, to this address: M. A. T. H.\r\n\r\n      S. N.\u2019 Do not these letters suggest Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d continued\r\n\r\n      the reporter. \u201cThe \u2018key with a brass head\u2019\u2014is not this the key? I\r\n\r\n      always read advertisements. In my business, as in yours, Monsieur, one\r\n\r\n      should always read the personals.\u2019 They are often the keys to intrigues,\r\n\r\n      that are not always brass-headed, but which are none the less interesting.\r\n\r\n      This advertisement interested me specially; the woman of the key\r\n\r\n      surrounded it with a kind of mystery. Evidently she valued the key, since\r\n\r\n      she promised a big reward for its restoration! And I thought on these six\r\n\r\n      letters: M. A. T. H. S. N. The first four at once pointed to a Christian\r\n\r\n      name; evidently I said Math is Mathilde. But I could make nothing of the\r\n\r\n      two last letters. So I threw the journal aside and occupied myself with\r\n\r\n      other matters. Four days later, when the evening paper appeared with\r\n\r\n      enormous head-lines announcing the murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson, the\r\n\r\n      letters in the advertisement mechanically recurred to me. I had forgotten\r\n\r\n      the two last letters, S. N. When I saw them again I could not help\r\n\r\n      exclaiming, \u2018Stangerson!\u2019 I jumped into a cab and rushed into the bureau\r\n\r\n      No. 40, asking: \u2018Have you a letter addressed to M. A. T. H. S. N.?\u2019 The\r\n\r\n      clerk replied that he had not. I insisted, begged and entreated him to\r\n\r\n      search. He wanted to know if I were playing a joke on him, and then told\r\n\r\n      me that he had had a letter with the initials M. A. T. H. S. N, but he had\r\n\r\n      given it up three days ago, to a lady who came for it. \u2018You come to-day to\r\n\r\n      claim the letter, and the day before yesterday another gentleman claimed\r\n\r\n      it! I\u2019ve had enough of this,\u2019 he concluded angrily. I tried to question\r\n\r\n      him as to the two persons who had already claimed the letter; but whether\r\n\r\n      he wished to entrench himself behind professional secrecy,\u2014he may\r\n\r\n      have thought that he had already said too much,\u2014or whether he was\r\n\r\n      disgusted at the joke that had been played on him\u2014he would not\r\n\r\n      answer any of my questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille paused. We all remained silent. Each drew his own conclusions\r\n\r\n      from the strange story of the poste restante letter. It seemed, indeed,\r\n\r\n      that we now had a thread by means of which we should be able to follow up\r\n\r\n      this extraordinary mystery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen it is almost certain,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson, \u201cthat my daughter\r\n\r\n      did lose the key, and that she did not tell me of it, wishing to spare any\r\n\r\n      anxiety, and that she begged whoever had found it to write to the poste\r\n\r\n      restante. She evidently feared that, by giving our address, inquiries\r\n\r\n      would have resulted that would have apprised me of the loss of the key. It\r\n\r\n      was quite logical, quite natural for her to have taken that course\u2014for\r\n\r\n      I have been robbed once before.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere was that, and when?\u201d asked the Chief of the Surete.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! many years ago, in America, in Philadelphia. There were stolen from\r\n\r\n      my laboratory the drawings of two inventions that might have made the\r\n\r\n      fortune of a man. Not only have I never learnt who the thief was, but I\r\n\r\n      have never heard even a word of the object of the robbery, doubtless\r\n\r\n      because, in order to defeat the plans of the person who had robbed me, I\r\n\r\n      myself brought these two inventions before the public, and so rendered the\r\n\r\n      robbery of no avail. From that time on I have been very careful to shut\r\n\r\n      myself in when I am at work. The bars to these windows, the lonely\r\n\r\n      situation of this pavilion, this cabinet, which I had specially\r\n\r\n      constructed, this special lock, this unique key, all are precautions\r\n\r\n      against fears inspired by a sad experience.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMost interesting!\u201d remarked Monsieur Dax.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Rouletabille asked about the reticule. Neither Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson nor Daddy Jacques had seen it for several days, but a few hours\r\n\r\n      later we learned from Mademoiselle Stangerson herself that the reticule\r\n\r\n      had either been stolen from her, or she had lost it. She further\r\n\r\n      corroborated all that had passed just as her father had stated. She had\r\n\r\n      gone to the poste restante and, on the 23rd of October, had received a\r\n\r\n      letter which, she affirmed, contained nothing but a vulgar pleasantry,\r\n\r\n      which she had immediately burned.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      To return to our examination, or rather to our conversation. I must state\r\n\r\n      that the Chief of the Surete having inquired of Monsieur Stangerson under\r\n\r\n      what conditions his daughter had gone to Paris on the 20th of October, we\r\n\r\n      learned that Monsieur Robert Darzac had accompanied her, and Darzac had\r\n\r\n      not been again seen at the chateau from that time to the day after the\r\n\r\n      crime had been committed. The fact that Monsieur Darzac was with her in\r\n\r\n      the Grands Magasins de la Louvre when the reticule disappeared could not\r\n\r\n      pass unnoticed, and, it must be said, strongly awakened our interest.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This conversation between magistrates, accused, victim, witnesses and\r\n\r\n      journalist, was coming to a close when quite a theatrical sensation\u2014an\r\n\r\n      incident of a kind displeasing to Monsieur de Marquet\u2014was produced.\r\n\r\n      The officer of the gendarmes came to announce that Frederic Larsan\r\n\r\n      requested to be admitted,\u2014a request that was at once complied with.\r\n\r\n      He held in his hand a heavy pair of muddy boots, which he threw on the\r\n\r\n      pavement of the laboratory.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201care the boots worn by the murderer. Do you recognise\r\n\r\n      them, Daddy Jacques?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques bent over them and, stupefied, recognised a pair of old\r\n\r\n      boots which he had, some time back, thrown into a corner of his attic. He\r\n\r\n      was so taken aback that he could not hide his agitation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then pointing to the handkerchief in the old man\u2019s hand, Frederic Larsan\r\n\r\n      said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s a handkerchief astonishingly like the one found in The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI know,\u201d said Daddy Jacques, trembling, \u201cthey are almost alike.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then,\u201d continued Frederic Larsan, \u201cthe old Basque cap also found in\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d might at one time have been worn by Daddy Jacques himself.\r\n\r\n      All this, gentlemen, proves, I think, that the murderer wished to disguise\r\n\r\n      his real personality. He did it in a very clumsy way\u2014or, at least,\r\n\r\n      so it appears to us. Don\u2019t be alarmed, Daddy Jacques; we are quite sure\r\n\r\n      that you were not the murderer; you never left the side of Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. But if Monsieur Stangerson had not been working that night and\r\n\r\n      had gone back to the chateau after parting with his daughter, and Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques had gone to sleep in his attic, no one would have doubted that he\r\n\r\n      was the murderer. He owes his safety, therefore, to the tragedy having\r\n\r\n      been enacted too soon,\u2014the murderer, no doubt, from the silence in\r\n\r\n      the laboratory, imagined that it was empty, and that the moment for action\r\n\r\n      had come. The man who had been able to introduce himself here so\r\n\r\n      mysteriously and to leave so many evidences against Daddy Jacques, was,\r\n\r\n      there can be no doubt, familiar with the house. At what hour exactly he\r\n\r\n      entered, whether in the afternoon or in the evening, I cannot say. One\r\n\r\n      familiar with the proceedings and persons of this pavilion could choose\r\n\r\n      his own time for entering \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe could not have entered it if anybody had been in the laboratory,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do we know that?\u201d replied Larsan. \u201cThere was the dinner in the\r\n\r\n      laboratory, the coming and going of the servants in attendance. There was\r\n\r\n      a chemical experiment being carried on between ten and eleven o\u2019clock,\r\n\r\n      with Monsieur Stangerson, his daughter, and Daddy Jacques engaged at the\r\n\r\n      furnace in a corner of the high chimney. Who can say that the murderer\u2014an\r\n\r\n      intimate!\u2014a friend!\u2014did not take advantage of that moment to\r\n\r\n      slip into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, after having taken off his boots in the\r\n\r\n      lavatory?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is very improbable,\u201d said Monsieur Stangerson.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoubtless\u2014but it is not impossible. I assert nothing. As to the\r\n\r\n      escape from the pavilion\u2014that\u2019s another thing, the most natural\r\n\r\n      thing in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      For a moment Frederic Larsan paused,\u2014a moment that appeared to us a\r\n\r\n      very long time. The eagerness with which we awaited what he was going to\r\n\r\n      tell us may be imagined.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have not been in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I take it for\r\n\r\n      granted that you have satisfied yourselves that he could have left the\r\n\r\n      room only by way of the door; it is by the door, then, that the murderer\r\n\r\n      made his way out. At what time? At the moment when it was most easy for\r\n\r\n      him to do so; at the moment when it became most explainable\u2014so\r\n\r\n      completely explainable that there can be no other explanation. Let us go\r\n\r\n      over the moments which followed after the crime had been committed. There\r\n\r\n      was the first moment, when Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques were\r\n\r\n      close to the door, ready to bar the way. There was the second moment,\r\n\r\n      during which Daddy Jacques was absent and Monsieur Stangerson was left\r\n\r\n      alone before the door. There was a third moment, when Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n      was joined by the concierge. There was a fourth moment, during which\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson, the concierge and his wife and Daddy Jacques were\r\n\r\n      before the door. There was a fifth moment, during which the door was burst\r\n\r\n      open and \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d entered. The moment at which the flight is\r\n\r\n      explainable is the very moment when there was the least number of persons\r\n\r\n      before the door. There was one moment when there was but one person,\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. Unless a complicity of silence on the part of Daddy Jacques is\r\n\r\n      admitted\u2014in which I do not believe\u2014the door was opened in the\r\n\r\n      presence of Monsieur Stangerson alone and the man escaped.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere we must admit that Monsieur Stangerson had powerful reasons for not\r\n\r\n      arresting, or not causing the arrest of the murderer, since he allowed him\r\n\r\n      to reach the window in the vestibule and closed it after him!\u2014That\r\n\r\n      done, Mademoiselle Stangerson, though horribly wounded, had still strength\r\n\r\n      enough, and no doubt in obedience to the entreaties of her father, to\r\n\r\n      refasten the door of her chamber, with both the bolt and the lock, before\r\n\r\n      sinking on the floor. We do not know who committed the crime; we do not\r\n\r\n      know of what wretch Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson are the victims,\r\n\r\n      but there is no doubt that they both know! The secret must be a terrible\r\n\r\n      one, for the father had not hesitated to leave his daughter to die behind\r\n\r\n      a door which she had shut upon herself,\u2014terrible for him to have\r\n\r\n      allowed the assassin to escape. For there is no other way in the world to\r\n\r\n      explain the murderer\u2019s flight from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The silence which followed this dramatic and lucid explanation was\r\n\r\n      appalling. We all of us felt grieved for the illustrious professor, driven\r\n\r\n      into a corner by the pitiless logic of Frederic Larsan, forced to confess\r\n\r\n      the whole truth of his martyrdom or to keep silent, and thus make a yet\r\n\r\n      more terrible admission. The man himself, a veritable statue of sorrow,\r\n\r\n      raised his hand with a gesture so solemn that we bowed our heads to it as\r\n\r\n      before something sacred. He then pronounced these words, in a voice so\r\n\r\n      loud that it seemed to exhaust him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI swear by the head of my suffering child that I never for an instant\r\n\r\n      left the door of her chamber after hearing her cries for help; that that\r\n\r\n      door was not opened while I was alone in the laboratory; and that,\r\n\r\n      finally, when we entered \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, my three domestics and I, the\r\n\r\n      murderer was no longer there! I swear I do not know the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Must I say it,\u2014in spite of the solemnity of Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s\r\n\r\n      words, we did not believe in his denial. Frederic Larsan had shown us the\r\n\r\n      truth and it was not so easily given up.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet announced that the conversation was at an end, and as\r\n\r\n      we were about to leave the laboratory, Joseph Rouletabille approached\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson, took him by the hand with the greatest respect, and I\r\n\r\n      heard him say:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI believe you, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I here close the citation which I have thought it my duty to make from\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Maleine\u2019s narrative. I need not tell the reader that all that\r\n\r\n      passed in the laboratory was immediately and faithfully reported to me by\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XII. Frederic Larsan\u2019s Cane\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was not till six o\u2019clock that I left the chateau, taking with me the\r\n\r\n      article hastily written by my friend in the little sitting-room which\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac had placed at our disposal. The reporter was to\r\n\r\n      sleep at the chateau, taking advantage of the to me inexplicable\r\n\r\n      hospitality offered him by Monsieur Robert Darzac, to whom Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, in that sad time, left the care of all his domestic affairs.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless he insisted on accompanying me to the station at Epinay. In\r\n\r\n      crossing the park, he said to me:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic is really very clever and has not belied his reputation. Do you\r\n\r\n      know how he came to find Daddy Jacques\u2019s boots?\u2014Near the spot where\r\n\r\n      we noticed the traces of the neat boots and the disappearance of the rough\r\n\r\n      ones, there was a square hole, freshly made in the moist ground, where a\r\n\r\n      stone had evidently been removed. Larsan searched for that stone without\r\n\r\n      finding it, and at once imagined that it had been used by the murderer\r\n\r\n      with which to sink the boots in the lake. Fred\u2019s calculation was an\r\n\r\n      excellent one, as the success of his search proves. That escaped me; but\r\n\r\n      my mind was turned in another direction by the large number of false\r\n\r\n      indications of his track which the murderer left, and by the measure of\r\n\r\n      the black foot-marks corresponding with that of Daddy Jacques\u2019s boots,\r\n\r\n      which I had established without his suspecting it, on the floor of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room. All which was a proof, in my eyes, that the murderer had\r\n\r\n      sought to turn suspicion on to the old servant. Up to that point, Larsan\r\n\r\n      and I are in accord; but no further. It is going to be a terrible matter;\r\n\r\n      for I tell you he is working on wrong lines, and I\u2014I, must fight him\r\n\r\n      with nothing!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was surprised at the profoundly grave accent with which my young friend\r\n\r\n      pronounced the last words.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He repeated:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes\u2014terrible!\u2014terrible! For it is fighting with nothing, when you\r\n\r\n      have only an idea to fight with.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment we passed by the back of the chateau. Night had come. A\r\n\r\n      window on the first floor was partly open. A feeble light came from it as\r\n\r\n      well as some sounds which drew our attention. We approached until we had\r\n\r\n      reached the side of a door that was situated just under the window.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, in a low tone, made me understand, that this was the window\r\n\r\n      of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber. The sounds which had attracted our\r\n\r\n      attention ceased, then were renewed for a moment, and then we heard\r\n\r\n      stifled sobs. We were only able to catch these words, which reached us\r\n\r\n      distinctly: \u201cMy poor Robert!\u201d\u2014Rouletabille whispered in my ear:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we only knew what was being said in that chamber, my inquiry would\r\n\r\n      soon be finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He looked about him. The darkness of the evening enveloped us; we could\r\n\r\n      not see much beyond the narrow path bordered by trees, which ran behind\r\n\r\n      the chateau. The sobs had ceased.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we can\u2019t hear we may at least try to see,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And, making a sign to me to deaden the sound of my steps, he led me across\r\n\r\n      the path to the trunk of a tall beech tree, the white bole of which was\r\n\r\n      visible in the darkness. This tree grew exactly in front of the window in\r\n\r\n      which we were so much interested, its lower branches being on a level with\r\n\r\n      the first floor of the chateau. From the height of those branches one\r\n\r\n      might certainly see what was passing in Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber.\r\n\r\n      Evidently that was what Rouletabille thought, for, enjoining me to remain\r\n\r\n      hidden, he clasped the trunk with his vigorous arms and climbed up. I soon\r\n\r\n      lost sight of him amid the branches, and then followed a deep silence. In\r\n\r\n      front of me, the open window remained lighted, and I saw no shadow move\r\n\r\n      across it. I listened, and presently from above me these words reached my\r\n\r\n      ears:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter you, pray!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Somebody was overhead, speaking,\u2014exchanging courtesies. What was my\r\n\r\n      astonishment to see on the slippery column of the tree two human forms\r\n\r\n      appear and quietly slip down to the ground. Rouletabille had mounted\r\n\r\n      alone, and had returned with another.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood evening, Monsieur Sainclair!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was Frederic Larsan. The detective had already occupied the post of\r\n\r\n      observation when my young friend had thought to reach it alone. Neither\r\n\r\n      noticed my astonishment. I explained that to myself by the fact that they\r\n\r\n      must have been witnesses of some tender and despairing scene between\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, lying in her bed, and Monsieur Darzac on his\r\n\r\n      knees by her pillow. I guessed that each had drawn different conclusions\r\n\r\n      from what they had seen. It was easy to see that the scene had strongly\r\n\r\n      impressed Rouletabille in favour of Monsieur Robert Darzac; while, to\r\n\r\n      Larsan, it showed nothing but consummate hypocrisy, acted with finished\r\n\r\n      art by Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As we reached the park gate, Larsan stopped us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy cane!\u201d he cried. \u201cI left it near the tree.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He left us, saying he would rejoin us presently.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you noticed Frederic Larsan\u2019s cane?\u201d asked the young reporter, as\r\n\r\n      soon as we were alone. \u201cIt is quite a new one, which I have never seen him\r\n\r\n      use before. He seems to take great care of it\u2014it never leaves him.\r\n\r\n      One would think he was afraid it might fall into the hands of strangers. I\r\n\r\n      never saw it before to-day. Where did he find it? It isn\u2019t natural that a\r\n\r\n      man who had never before used a walking-stick should, the day after the\r\n\r\n      Glandier crime, never move a step without one. On the day of our arrival\r\n\r\n      at the chateau, as soon as he saw us, he put his watch in his pocket and\r\n\r\n      picked up his cane from the ground\u2014a proceeding to which I was\r\n\r\n      perhaps wrong not to attach some importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were now out of the park. Rouletabille had dropped into silence. His\r\n\r\n      thoughts were certainly still occupied with Frederic Larsan\u2019s new cane. I\r\n\r\n      had proof of that when, as we came near to Epinay, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic Larsan arrived at the Glandier before me; he began his inquiry\r\n\r\n      before me; he has had time to find out things about which I know nothing.\r\n\r\n      Where did he find that cane?\u201d Then he added: \u201cIt is probable that his\r\n\r\n      suspicion\u2014more than that, his reasoning\u2014has led him to lay his\r\n\r\n      hand on something tangible. Has this cane anything to do with it? Where\r\n\r\n      the deuce could he have found it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As I had to wait twenty minutes for the train at Epinay, we entered a wine\r\n\r\n      shop. Almost immediately the door opened and Frederic Larsan made his\r\n\r\n      appearance, brandishing his famous cane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI found it!\u201d he said laughingly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The three of us seated ourselves at a table. Rouletabille never took his\r\n\r\n      eyes off the cane; he was so absorbed that he did not notice a sign Larsan\r\n\r\n      made to a railway employee, a young man with a chin decorated by a tiny\r\n\r\n      blond and ill-kept beard. On the sign he rose, paid for his drink, bowed,\r\n\r\n      and went out. I should not myself have attached any importance to the\r\n\r\n      circumstance, if it had not been recalled to my mind, some months later,\r\n\r\n      by the reappearance of the man with the beard at one of the most tragic\r\n\r\n      moments of this case. I then learned that the youth was one of Larsan\u2019s\r\n\r\n      assistants and had been charged by him to watch the going and coming of\r\n\r\n      travellers at the station of Epinay-sur-Orge. Larsan neglected nothing in\r\n\r\n      any case on which he was engaged.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I turned my eyes again on Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh,\u2014Monsieur Fred!\u201d he said, \u201cwhen did you begin to use a\r\n\r\n      walking-stick? I have always seen you walking with your hands in your\r\n\r\n      pockets!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a present,\u201d replied the detective.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRecent?\u201d insisted Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, it was given to me in London.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, yes, I remember\u2014you have just come from London. May I look at\r\n\r\n      it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh!\u2014certainly!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Fred passed the cane to Rouletabille. It was a large yellow bamboo with a\r\n\r\n      crutch handle and ornamented with a gold ring. Rouletabille, after\r\n\r\n      examining it minutely, returned it to Larsan, with a bantering expression\r\n\r\n      on his face, saying:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou were given a French cane in London!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPossibly,\u201d said Fred, imperturbably.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRead the mark there, in tiny letters: Cassette, 6a, Opera.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCannot English people buy canes in Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      When Rouletabille had seen me into the train, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll remember the address?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u2014Cassette, 6a, Opera. Rely on me; you shall have word tomorrow\r\n\r\n      morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That evening, on reaching Paris, I saw Monsieur Cassette, dealer in\r\n\r\n      walking-sticks and umbrellas, and wrote to my friend:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA man unmistakably answering to the description of Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2014same\r\n\r\n      height, slightly stooping, putty-coloured overcoat, bowler hat\u2014purchased\r\n\r\n      a cane similar to the one in which we are interested, on the evening of\r\n\r\n      the crime, about eight o\u2019clock. Monsieur Cassette had not sold another\r\n\r\n      such cane during the last two years. Fred\u2019s cane is new. It is quite clear\r\n\r\n      that it\u2019s the same cane. Fred did not buy it, since he was in London. Like\r\n\r\n      you, I think that he found it somewhere near Monsieur Robert Darzac. But\r\n\r\n      if, as you suppose, the murderer was in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d for five, or even\r\n\r\n      six hours, and the crime was not committed until towards midnight, the\r\n\r\n      purchase of this cane proves an incontestable alibi for Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XIII. \u201cThe Presbytery Has Lost Nothing of Its Charm, Nor the\r\n\r\n      Garden Its Brightness\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A week after the occurrence of the events I have just recounted\u2014on\r\n\r\n      the 2nd of November, to be exact\u2014I received at my home in Paris the\r\n\r\n      following telegraphic message: \u201cCome to the Glandier by the earliest\r\n\r\n      train. Bring revolvers. Friendly greetings. Rouletabille.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I have already said, I think, that at that period, being a young barrister\r\n\r\n      with but few briefs, I frequented the Palais de Justice rather for the\r\n\r\n      purpose of familiarising myself with my professional duties than for the\r\n\r\n      defence of the widow and orphan. I could, therefore, feel no surprise at\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille disposing of my time. Moreover, he knew how keenly interested\r\n\r\n      I was in his journalistic adventures in general and, above all, in the\r\n\r\n      murder at the Glandier. I had not heard from him for a week, nor of the\r\n\r\n      progress made with that mysterious case, except by the innumerable\r\n\r\n      paragraphs in the newspapers and by the very brief notes of Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      in the \u201cEpoque.\u201d Those notes had divulged the fact that traces of human\r\n\r\n      blood had been found on the mutton-bone, as well as fresh traces of the\r\n\r\n      blood of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014the old stains belonged to other\r\n\r\n      crimes, probably dating years back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It may be easily imagined that the crime engaged the attention of the\r\n\r\n      press throughout the world. No crime known had more absorbed the minds of\r\n\r\n      people. It appeared to me, however, that the judicial inquiry was making\r\n\r\n      but very little progress; and I should have been very glad, if, on the\r\n\r\n      receipt of my friend\u2019s invitation to rejoin him at the Glandier, the\r\n\r\n      despatch had not contained the words, \u201cBring revolvers.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That puzzled me greatly. Rouletabille telegraphing for revolvers meant\r\n\r\n      that there might be occasion to use them. Now, I confess it without shame,\r\n\r\n      I am not a hero. But here was a friend, evidently in danger, calling on me\r\n\r\n      to go to his aid. I did not hesitate long; and after assuring myself that\r\n\r\n      the only revolver I possessed was properly loaded, I hurried towards the\r\n\r\n      Orleans station. On the way I remembered that Rouletabille had asked for\r\n\r\n      two revolvers; I therefore entered a gunsmith\u2019s shop and bought an\r\n\r\n      excellent weapon for my friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I had hoped to find him at the station at Epinay; but he was not there.\r\n\r\n      However, a cab was waiting for me and I was soon at the Glandier. Nobody\r\n\r\n      was at the gate, and it was only on the threshold of the chateau that I\r\n\r\n      met the young man. He saluted me with a friendly gesture and threw his\r\n\r\n      arms about me, inquiring warmly as to the state of my health.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When we were in the little sitting-room of which I have spoken,\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille made me sit down.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s going badly,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat\u2019s going badly?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He came nearer to me and whispered:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic Larsan is working with might and main against Darzac.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      This did not astonish me. I had seen the poor show Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s fiance had made at the time of the examination of the\r\n\r\n      footprints. However, I immediately asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat about that cane?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is still in the hands of Frederic Larsan. He never lets go of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut doesn\u2019t it prove the alibi for Monsieur Darzac?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot at all. Gently questioned by me, Darzac denied having, on that\r\n\r\n      evening, or on any other, purchased a cane at Cassette\u2019s. However,\u201d said\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, \u201cI\u2019ll not swear to anything; Monsieur Darzac has such\r\n\r\n      strange fits of silence that one does not know exactly what to think of\r\n\r\n      what he says.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo Frederic Larsan this cane must mean a piece of very damaging evidence.\r\n\r\n      But in what way? The time when it was bought shows it could not have been\r\n\r\n      in the murderer\u2019s possession.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe time doesn\u2019t worry Larsan. He is not obliged to adopt my theory which\r\n\r\n      assumes that the murderer got into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d between five and six\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock. But there\u2019s nothing to prevent him assuming that the murderer got\r\n\r\n      in between ten and eleven o\u2019clock at night. At that hour Monsieur and\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, assisted by Daddy Jacques, were engaged in making\r\n\r\n      an interesting chemical experiment in the part of the laboratory taken up\r\n\r\n      by the furnaces. Larsan says, unlikely as that may seem, that the murderer\r\n\r\n      may have slipped behind them. He has already got the examining magistrate\r\n\r\n      to listen to him. When one looks closely into it, the reasoning is absurd,\r\n\r\n      seeing that the \u2018intimate\u2019\u2014if there is one\u2014must have known\r\n\r\n      that the professor would shortly leave the pavilion, and that the \u2018friend\u2019\r\n\r\n      had only to put off operating till after the professor\u2019s departure. Why\r\n\r\n      should he have risked crossing the laboratory while the professor was in\r\n\r\n      it? And then, when he had got into \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are many points to be cleared up before Larsan\u2019s theory can be\r\n\r\n      admitted. I sha\u2019n\u2019t waste my time over it, for my theory won\u2019t allow me to\r\n\r\n      occupy myself with mere imagination. Only, as I am obliged for the moment\r\n\r\n      to keep silent, and Larsan sometimes talks, he may finish by coming out\r\n\r\n      openly against Monsieur Darzac,\u2014if I\u2019m not there,\u201d added the young\r\n\r\n      reporter proudly. \u201cFor there are surface evidences against Darzac, much\r\n\r\n      more convincing than that cane, which remains incomprehensible to me, all\r\n\r\n      the more so as Larsan does not in the least hesitate to let Darzac see him\r\n\r\n      with it!\u2014I understand many things in Larsan\u2019s theory, but I can\u2019t\r\n\r\n      make anything of that cane.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs he still at the chateau?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; he hardly ever leaves it!\u2014He sleeps there, as I do, at the\r\n\r\n      request of Monsieur Stangerson, who has done for him what Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac has done for me. In spite of the accusation made by Larsan that\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson knows who the murderer is he yet affords him every\r\n\r\n      facility for arriving at the truth,\u2014just as Darzac is doing for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut you are convinced of Darzac\u2019s innocence?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt one time I did believe in the possibility of his guilt. That was when\r\n\r\n      we arrived here for the first time. The time has come for me to tell you\r\n\r\n      what has passed between Monsieur Darzac and myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here Rouletabille interrupted himself and asked me if I had brought the\r\n\r\n      revolvers. I showed him them. Having examined both, he pronounced them\r\n\r\n      excellent, and handed them back to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShall we have any use for them?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt; this evening. We shall pass the night here\u2014if that won\u2019t\r\n\r\n      tire you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d I said with an expression that made Rouletabille laugh.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is no time for laughing. You remember the phrase\r\n\r\n      which was the \u2018open sesame\u2019 of this chateau full of mystery?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cperfectly,\u2014\u2018The presbytery has lost nothing of its\r\n\r\n      charm, nor the garden its brightness.\u2019 It was the phrase which you found\r\n\r\n      on the half-burned piece of paper amongst the ashes in the laboratory.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; at the bottom of the paper, where the flame had not reached, was\r\n\r\n      this date: 23rd of October. Remember this date, it is highly important. I\r\n\r\n      am now going to tell you about that curious phrase. On the evening before\r\n\r\n      the crime, that is to say, on the 23rd, Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson were at a reception at the Elysee. I know that, because I was\r\n\r\n      there on duty, having to interview one of the savants of the Academy of\r\n\r\n      Philadelphia, who was being feted there. I had never before seen either\r\n\r\n      Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson. I was seated in the room which\r\n\r\n      precedes the Salon des Ambassadeurs, and, tired of being jostled by so\r\n\r\n      many noble personages, I had fallen into a vague reverie, when I scented\r\n\r\n      near me the perfume of the lady in black.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you ask me what is the \u2018perfume of the lady in black\u2019? It must suffice\r\n\r\n      for you to know that it is a perfume of which I am very fond, because it\r\n\r\n      was that of a lady who had been very kind to me in my childhood,\u2014a\r\n\r\n      lady whom I had always seen dressed in black. The lady who, that evening,\r\n\r\n      was scented with the perfume of the lady in black, was dressed in white.\r\n\r\n      She was wonderfully beautiful. I could not help rising and following her.\r\n\r\n      An old man gave her his arm and, as they passed, I heard voices say:\r\n\r\n      \u2018Professor Stangerson and his daughter.\u2019 It was in that way I learned who\r\n\r\n      it was I was following.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey met Monsieur Robert Darzac, whom I knew by sight. Professor\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, accosted by Mr. Arthur William Rance, one of the American\r\n\r\n      savants, seated himself in the great gallery, and Monsieur Robert Darzac\r\n\r\n      led Mademoiselle Stangerson into the conservatory. I followed. The weather\r\n\r\n      was very mild that evening; the garden doors were open. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson threw a fichu shawl over her shoulders and I plainly saw that\r\n\r\n      it was she who was begging Monsieur Darzac to go with her into the garden.\r\n\r\n      I continued to follow, interested by the agitation plainly exhibited by\r\n\r\n      the bearing of Monsieur Darzac. They slowly passed along the wall abutting\r\n\r\n      on the Avenue Marigny. I took the central alley, walking parallel with\r\n\r\n      them, and then crossed over for the purpose of getting nearer to them. The\r\n\r\n      night was dark, and the grass deadened the sound of my steps. They had\r\n\r\n      stopped under the vacillating light of a gas jet and appeared to be both\r\n\r\n      bending over a paper held by Mademoiselle Stangerson, reading something\r\n\r\n      which deeply interested them. I stopped in the darkness and silence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNeither of them saw me, and I distinctly heard Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      repeat, as she was refolding the paper: \u2018The presbytery has lost nothing\r\n\r\n      of its charm, nor the garden its brightness!\u2019\u2014It was said in a tone\r\n\r\n      at once mocking and despairing, and was followed by a burst of such\r\n\r\n      nervous laughter that I think her words will never cease to sound in my\r\n\r\n      ears. But another phrase was uttered by Monsieur Robert Darzac: \u2018Must I\r\n\r\n      commit a crime, then, to win you?\u2019 He was in an extraordinarily agitated\r\n\r\n      state. He took the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson and held it for a long\r\n\r\n      time to his lips, and I thought, from the movement of his shoulders, that\r\n\r\n      he was crying. Then they went away.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I returned to the great gallery,\u201d continued Rouletabille, \u201cI saw no\r\n\r\n      more of Monsieur Robert Darzac, and I was not to see him again until after\r\n\r\n      the tragedy at the Glandier. Mademoiselle was near Mr. Rance, who was\r\n\r\n      talking with much animation, his eyes, during the conversation, glowing\r\n\r\n      with a singular brightness. Mademoiselle Stangerson, I thought, was not\r\n\r\n      even listening to what he was saying, her face expressing perfect\r\n\r\n      indifference. His face was the red face of a drunkard. When Monsieur and\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson left, he went to the bar and remained there. I\r\n\r\n      joined him, and rendered him some little service in the midst of the\r\n\r\n      pressing crowd. He thanked me and told me he was returning to America\r\n\r\n      three days later, that is to say, on the 26th (the day after the crime). I\r\n\r\n      talked with him about Philadelphia; he told me he had lived there for\r\n\r\n      five-and-twenty years, and that it was there he had met the illustrious\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson and his daughter. He drank a great deal of champagne,\r\n\r\n      and when I left him he was very nearly drunk.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSuch were my experiences on that evening, and I leave you to imagine what\r\n\r\n      effect the news of the attempted murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      produced on me,\u2014with what force those words pronounced by Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac, \u2018Must I commit a crime, then, to win you?\u2019 recurred to me.\r\n\r\n      It was not this phrase, however, that I repeated to him, when we met here\r\n\r\n      at Glandier. The sentence of the presbytery and the bright garden sufficed\r\n\r\n      to open the gate of the chateau. If you ask me if I believe now that\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac is the murderer, I must say I do not. I do not think I\r\n\r\n      ever quite thought that. At the time I could not really think seriously of\r\n\r\n      anything. I had so little evidence to go on. But I needed to have at once\r\n\r\n      the proof that he had not been wounded in the hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen we were alone together, I told him how I had chanced to overhear a\r\n\r\n      part of his conversation with Mademoiselle Stangerson in the garden of the\r\n\r\n      Elysee; and when I repeated to him the words, \u2018Must I commit a crime,\r\n\r\n      then, to win you?\u2019 he was greatly troubled, though much less so than he\r\n\r\n      had been by hearing me repeat the phrase about the presbytery. What threw\r\n\r\n      him into a state of real consternation was to learn from me that the day\r\n\r\n      on which he had gone to meet Mademoiselle Stangerson at the Elysee, was\r\n\r\n      the very day on which she had gone to the Post Office for the letter. It\r\n\r\n      was that letter, perhaps, which ended with the words: \u2018The presbytery has\r\n\r\n      lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.\u2019 My surmise was\r\n\r\n      confirmed by my finding, if you remember, in the ashes of the laboratory,\r\n\r\n      the fragment of paper dated October the 23rd. The letter had been written\r\n\r\n      and withdrawn from the Post Office on the same day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere can be no doubt that, on returning from the Elysee that night,\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had tried to destroy that compromising paper. It\r\n\r\n      was in vain that Monsieur Darzac denied that that letter had anything\r\n\r\n      whatever to do with the crime. I told him that in an affair so filled with\r\n\r\n      mystery as this, he had no right to hide this letter; that I was persuaded\r\n\r\n      it was of considerable importance; that the desperate tone in which\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had pronounced the prophetic phrase,\u2014that\r\n\r\n      his own tears, and the threat of a crime which he had professed after the\r\n\r\n      letter was read\u2014all these facts tended to leave no room for me to\r\n\r\n      doubt. Monsieur Darzac became more and more agitated, and I determined to\r\n\r\n      take advantage of the effect I had produced on him. \u2018You were on the point\r\n\r\n      of being married, Monsieur,\u2019 I said negligently and without looking at\r\n\r\n      him, \u2018and suddenly your marriage becomes impossible because of the writer\r\n\r\n      of that letter; because as soon as his letter was read, you spoke of the\r\n\r\n      necessity for a crime to win Mademoiselle Stangerson. Therefore there is someone between you and her\u2014someone who is preventing your marriage with\r\n\r\nher\u2014someone who has attempted to kill her, so that she should not be able to marry!\u2019 And I concluded with these words: \u2018Now,\r\n\r\n      monsieur, you have only to tell me in confidence the name of the\r\n\r\n      murderer!\u2019\u2014The words I had uttered must have struck him ominously,\r\n\r\n      for when I turned my eyes on him, I saw that his face was haggard, the\r\n\r\n      perspiration standing on his forehead, and terror showing in his eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Monsieur,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I am going to ask of you something which may\r\n\r\n      appear insane, but in exchange for which I place my life in your hands.\r\n\r\n      You must not tell the magistrates of what you saw and heard in the garden\r\n\r\n      of the Elysee,\u2014neither to them nor to anybody. I swear to you, that\r\n\r\n      I am innocent, and I know, I feel, that you believe me; but I would rather\r\n\r\n      be taken for the guilty man than see justice go astray on that phrase,\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its\r\n\r\n      brightness.\u201d The judges must know nothing about that phrase. All this\r\n\r\n      matter is in your hands. Monsieur, I leave it there; but forget the\r\n\r\n      evening at the Elysee. A hundred other roads are open to you in your\r\n\r\n      search for the criminal. I will open them for you myself. I will help you.\r\n\r\n      Will you take up your quarters here?\u2014You may remain here to do as\r\n\r\n      you please.\u2014Eat\u2014sleep here\u2014watch my actions\u2014the\r\n\r\n      actions of all here. You shall be master of the Glandier, Monsieur; but\r\n\r\n      forget the evening at the Elysee.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille here paused to take breath. I now understood what had\r\n\r\n      appeared so unexplainable in the demeanour of Monsieur Robert Darzac\r\n\r\n      towards my friend, and the facility with which the young reporter had been\r\n\r\n      able to install himself on the scene of the crime. My curiosity could not\r\n\r\n      fail to be excited by all I had heard. I asked Rouletabille to satisfy it\r\n\r\n      still further. What had happened at the Glandier during the past week?\u2014Had\r\n\r\n      he not told me that there were surface indications against Monsieur Darzac\r\n\r\n      much more terrible than that of the cane found by Larsan?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything seems to be pointing against him,\u201d replied my friend, \u201cand the\r\n\r\n      situation is becoming exceedingly grave. Monsieur Darzac appears not to\r\n\r\n      mind it much; but in that he is wrong. I was interested only in the health\r\n\r\n      of Mademoiselle Stangerson, which was daily improving, when something\r\n\r\n      occurred that is even more mysterious than\u2014than the mystery of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cImpossible!\u201d I cried, \u201cWhat could be more mysterious than that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLet us first go back to Monsieur Robert Darzac,\u201d said Rouletabille,\r\n\r\n      calming me. \u201cI have said that everything seems to be pointing against him.\r\n\r\n      The marks of the neat boots found by Frederic Larsan appear to be really\r\n\r\n      the footprints of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance. The marks made by the\r\n\r\n      bicycle may have been made by his bicycle. He had usually left it at the\r\n\r\n      chateau; why did he take it to Paris on that particular occasion? Was it\r\n\r\n      because he was not going to return again to the chateau? Was it because,\r\n\r\n      owing to the breaking off of his marriage, his relations with the\r\n\r\n      Stangersons were to cease? All who are interested in the matter affirm\r\n\r\n      that those relations were to continue unchanged.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic Larsan, however, believes that all relations were at an end.\r\n\r\n      From the day when Monsieur Darzac accompanied Mademoiselle Stangerson to\r\n\r\n      the Grands Magasins de la Louvre until the day after the crime, he had not\r\n\r\n      been at the Glandier. Remember that Mademoiselle Stangerson lost her\r\n\r\n      reticule containing the key with the brass head while she was in his\r\n\r\n      company. From that day to the evening at the Elysee, the Sorbonne\r\n\r\n      professor and Mademoiselle Stangerson did not see one another; but they\r\n\r\n      may have written to each other. Mademoiselle Stangerson went to the Post\r\n\r\n      Office to get a letter, which Larsan says was written by Robert Darzac;\r\n\r\n      for knowing nothing of what had passed at the Elysee, Larsan believes that\r\n\r\n      it was Monsieur Darzac himself who stole the reticule with the key, with\r\n\r\n      the design of forcing her consent, by getting possession of the precious\r\n\r\n      papers of her father\u2014papers which he would have restored to him on\r\n\r\n      condition that the marriage engagement was to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll that would have been a very doubtful and almost absurd hypothesis, as\r\n\r\n      Larsan admitted to me, but for another and much graver circumstance. In\r\n\r\n      the first place here is something which I have not been able to explain\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Darzac had himself, on the 24th, gone to the Post Office to ask for the\r\n\r\n      letter which Mademoiselle had called for and received on the previous\r\n\r\n      evening. The description of the man who made application tallies in every\r\n\r\n      respect with the appearance of Monsieur Darzac, who, in answer to the\r\n\r\n      questions put to him by the examining magistrate, denies that he went to\r\n\r\n      the Post Office. Now even admitting that the letter was written by him\u2014which\r\n\r\n      I do not believe\u2014he knew that Mademoiselle Stangerson had received\r\n\r\n      it, since he had seen it in her hands in the garden at the Elysee. It\r\n\r\n      could not have been he, then, who had gone to the Post Office, the day\r\n\r\n      after the 24th, to ask for a letter which he knew was no longer there.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo me it appears clear that somebody, strongly resembling him, stole\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s reticule and in that letter, had demanded of her\r\n\r\n      something which she had not sent him. He must have been surprised at the\r\n\r\n      failure of his demand, hence his application at the Post Office, to learn\r\n\r\n      whether his letter had been delivered to the person to whom it had been\r\n\r\n      addressed. Finding that it had been claimed, he had become furious. What\r\n\r\n      had he demanded? Nobody but Mademoiselle Stangerson knows. Then, on the\r\n\r\n      day following, it is reported that she had been attacked during the night,\r\n\r\n      and, the next day, I discovered that the Professor had, at the same time,\r\n\r\n      been robbed by means of the key referred to in the poste restante letter.\r\n\r\n      It would seem, then, that the man who went to the Post Office to inquire\r\n\r\n      for the letter must have been the murderer. All these arguments Larsan\r\n\r\n      applies as against Monsieur Darzac. You may be sure that the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate, Larsan, and myself, have done our best to get from the Post\r\n\r\n      Office precise details relative to the singular personage who applied\r\n\r\n      there on the 24th of October. But nothing has been learned. We don\u2019t know\r\n\r\n      where he came from\u2014or where he went. Beyond the description which\r\n\r\n      makes him resemble Monsieur Darzac, we know nothing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have announced in the leading journals that a handsome reward will be\r\n\r\n      given to a driver of any public conveyance who drove a fare to No. 40,\r\n\r\n      Post Office, about ten o\u2019clock on the morning of the 24th of October.\r\n\r\n      Information to be addressed to \u2018M. R.,\u2019 at the office of the \u2018Epoque\u2019; but\r\n\r\n      no answer has resulted. The man may have walked; but, as he was most\r\n\r\n      likely in a hurry, there was a chance that he might have gone in a cab.\r\n\r\n      Who, I keep asking myself night and day, is the man who so strongly\r\n\r\n      resembles Monsieur Robert Darzac, and who is also known to have bought the\r\n\r\n      cane which has fallen into Larsan\u2019s hands?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe most serious fact is that Monsieur Darzac was, at the very same time\r\n\r\n      that his double presented himself at the Post Office, scheduled for a\r\n\r\n      lecture at the Sorbonne. He had not delivered that lecture, and one of his\r\n\r\n      friends took his place. When I questioned him as to how he had employeed\r\n\r\n      the time, he told me that he had gone for a stroll in the Bois de\r\n\r\n      Boulogne. What do you think of a professor who, instead of giving his\r\n\r\n      lecture, obtains a substitute to go for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne?\r\n\r\n      When Frederic Larsan asked him for information on this point, he quietly\r\n\r\n      replied that it was no business of his how he spent his time in Paris. On\r\n\r\n      which Fred swore aloud that he would find out, without anybody\u2019s help.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll this seems to fit in with Fred\u2019s hypothesis, namely, that Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson allowed the murderer to escape in order to avoid a scandal. The\r\n\r\n      hypothesis is further substantiated by the fact that Darzac was in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room and was permitted to get away. That hypothesis I believe to be\r\n\r\n      a false one.\u2014Larsan is being misled by it, though that would not\r\n\r\n      displease me, did it not affect an innocent person. Now does that\r\n\r\n      hypothesis really mislead Frederic Larsan? That is the question\u2014that\r\n\r\n      is the question.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps he is right,\u201d I cried, interrupting Rouletabille. \u201cAre you sure\r\n\r\n      that Monsieur Darzac is innocent?\u2014It seems to me that these are\r\n\r\n      extraordinary coincidences\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCoincidences,\u201d replied my friend, \u201care the worst enemies to truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat does the examining magistrate think now of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur de Marquet hesitates to accuse Monsieur Darzac, in the absence\r\n\r\n      of absolute proofs. Not only would he have public opinion wholly against\r\n\r\n      him, to say nothing of the Sorbonne, but Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. She adores Monsieur Robert Darzac. Indistinctly as she saw the\r\n\r\n      murderer, it would be hard to make the public believe that she could not\r\n\r\n      have recognised him, if Darzac had been the criminal. No doubt The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room was very dimly lit; but a night-light, however small, gives some\r\n\r\n      light. Here, my boy, is how things stood when, three days, or rather three\r\n\r\n      nights ago, an extraordinarily strange incident occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XIV. \u201cI Expect the Assassin This Evening\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI must take you,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cso as to enable you to understand,\r\n\r\n      to the various scenes. I myself believe that I have discovered what\r\n\r\n      everybody else is searching for, namely, how the murderer escaped from The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room, without any accomplice, and without Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      having had anything to do with it. But so long as I am not sure of the\r\n\r\n      real murderer, I cannot state the theory on which I am working. I can only\r\n\r\n      say that I believe it to be correct and, in any case, a quite natural and\r\n\r\n      simple one. As to what happened in this place three nights ago, I must say\r\n\r\n      it kept me wondering for a whole day and a night. It passes all belief.\r\n\r\n      The theory I have formed from the incident is so absurd that I would\r\n\r\n      rather matters remained as yet unexplained.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Saying which the young reporter invited me to go and make the tour of the\r\n\r\n      chateau with him. The only sound to be heard was the crunching of the dead\r\n\r\n      leaves beneath our feet. The silence was so intense that one might have\r\n\r\n      thought the chateau had been abandoned. The old stones, the stagnant water\r\n\r\n      of the ditch surrounding the donjon, the bleak ground strewn with the dead\r\n\r\n      leaves, the dark, skeleton-like outlines of the trees, all contributed to\r\n\r\n      give to the desolate place, now filled with its awful mystery, a most\r\n\r\n      funereal aspect. As we passed round the donjon, we met the Green Man, the\r\n\r\n      forest-keeper, who did not greet us, but walked by as if we had not\r\n\r\n      existed. He was looking just as I had formerly seen him through the window\r\n\r\n      of the Donjon Inn. He had still his fowling-piece slung at his back, his\r\n\r\n      pipe was in his mouth, and his eye-glasses on his nose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn odd kind of fish!\u201d Rouletabille said to me, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you spoken to him?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, but I could get nothing out of him. His only answers are grunts and\r\n\r\n      shrugs of the shoulders. He generally lives on the first floor of the\r\n\r\n      donjon, a big room that once served for an oratory. He lives like a bear,\r\n\r\n      never goes out without his gun, and is only pleasant with the girls. The\r\n\r\n      women, for twelve miles round, are all setting their caps for him. For the\r\n\r\n      present, he is paying attention to Madame Mathieu, whose husband is\r\n\r\n      keeping a lynx eye upon her in consequence.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      After passing the donjon, which is situated at the extreme end of the left\r\n\r\n      wing, we went to the back of the chateau. Rouletabille, pointing to a\r\n\r\n      window which I recognised as the only one belonging to Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s apartment, said to me:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you had been here, two nights ago, you would have seen your humble\r\n\r\n      servant at the top of a ladder, about to enter the chateau by that\r\n\r\n      window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      As I expressed some surprise at this piece of nocturnal gymnastics, he\r\n\r\n      begged me to notice carefully the exterior disposition of the chateau. We\r\n\r\n      then went back into the building.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI must now show you the first floor of the chateau, where I am living,\u201d\r\n\r\n       said my friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      To enable the reader the better to understand the disposition of these\r\n\r\n      parts of the dwelling, I annex a plan of the first floor of the right\r\n\r\n      wing, drawn by Rouletabille the day after the extraordinary phenomenon\r\n\r\n      occurred, the details of which I am about to relate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille motioned me to follow him up a magnificent flight of stairs\r\n\r\n      ending in a landing on the first floor. From this landing one could pass\r\n\r\n      to the right or left wing of the chateau by a gallery opening from it.\r\n\r\n      This gallery, high and wide, extended along the whole length of the\r\n\r\n      building and was lit from the front of the chateau facing the north. The\r\n\r\n      rooms, the windows of which looked to the south, opened out of the\r\n\r\n      gallery. Professor Stangerson inhabited the left wing of the building.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had her apartment in the right wing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We entered the gallery to the right. A narrow carpet, laid on the waxed\r\n\r\n      oaken floor, which shone like glass, deadened the sound of our footsteps.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille asked me, in a low tone, to walk carefully, as we were\r\n\r\n      passing the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s apartment. This consisted of\r\n\r\n      a bed-room, an ante-room, a small bath-room, a boudoir, and a\r\n\r\n      drawing-room. One could pass from one to another of these rooms without\r\n\r\n      having to go by way of the gallery. The gallery continued straight to the\r\n\r\n      western end of the building, where it was lit by a high window (window 2\r\n\r\n      on the plan). At about two-thirds of its length this gallery, at a right\r\n\r\n      angle, joined another gallery following the course of the right wing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The better to follow this narrative, we shall call the gallery leading\r\n\r\n      from the stairs to the eastern window, the \u201cright\u201d gallery and the gallery\r\n\r\n      quitting it at a right angle, the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery (winding gallery\r\n\r\n      in the plan). It was at the meeting point of the two galleries that\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had his chamber, adjoining that of Frederic Larsan, the door\r\n\r\n      of each opening on to the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery, while the doors of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s apartment opened into the \u201cright\u201d gallery. (See\r\n\r\n      the plan.)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille opened the door of his room and after we had passed in,\r\n\r\n      carefully drew the bolt. I had not had time to glance round the place in\r\n\r\n      which he had been installed, when he uttered a cry of surprise and pointed\r\n\r\n      to a pair of eye-glasses on a side-table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are these doing here?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I should have been puzzled to answer him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, \u201cI wonder if this is what I have been searching for.\r\n\r\n      I wonder if these are the eye-glasses from the presbytery!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He seized them eagerly, his fingers caressing the glass. Then looking at\r\n\r\n      me, with an expression of terror on his face, he murmured, \u201cOh!\u2014Oh!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He repeated the exclamation again and again, as if his thoughts had\r\n\r\n      suddenly turned his brain.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He rose and, putting his hand on my shoulder, laughed like one demented as\r\n\r\n      he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThose glasses will drive me silly! Mathematically speaking the thing is\r\n\r\n      possible; but humanly speaking it is impossible\u2014or afterwards\u2014or\r\n\r\n      afterwards\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Two light knocks struck the door. Rouletabille opened it. A figure\r\n\r\n      entered. I recognised the concierge, whom I had seen when she was being\r\n\r\n      taken to the pavilion for examination. I was surprised, thinking she was\r\n\r\n      still under lock and key. This woman said in a very low tone:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the grove of the parquet.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille replied: \u201cThanks.\u201d\u2014The woman then left. He again turned\r\n\r\n      to me, his look haggard, after having carefully refastened the door,\r\n\r\n      muttering some incomprehensible phrases.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf the thing is mathematically possible, why should it not be humanly!\u2014And\r\n\r\n      if it is humanly possible, the matter is simply awful.\u201d I interrupted him\r\n\r\n      in his soliloquy:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave they set the concierges at liberty, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI had them liberated, I needed people I could trust.\r\n\r\n      The woman is thoroughly devoted to me, and her husband would lay down his\r\n\r\n      life for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOho!\u201d I said, \u201cwhen will he have occasion to do it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis evening,\u2014for this evening I expect the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou expect the murderer this evening? Then you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI shall know him; but I should be mad to affirm, categorically, at this\r\n\r\n      moment that I do know him. The mathematical idea I have of the murderer\r\n\r\n      gives results so frightful, so monstrous, that I hope it is still possible\r\n\r\n      that I am mistaken. I hope so, with all my heart!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFive minutes ago, you did not know the murderer; how can you say that you\r\n\r\n      expect him this evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause I know that he must come.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille very slowly filled his pipe and lit it. That meant an\r\n\r\n      interesting story. At that moment we heard some one walking in the gallery\r\n\r\n      and passing before our door. Rouletabille listened. The sound of the\r\n\r\n      footstep died away in the distance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs Frederic Larsan in his room?\u201d I asked, pointing to the partition.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d my friend answered. \u201cHe went to Paris this morning,\u2014still on\r\n\r\n      the scent of Darzac, who also left for Paris. That matter will turn out\r\n\r\n      badly. I expect that Monsieur Darzac will be arrested in the course of the\r\n\r\n      next week. The worst of it is that everything seems to be in league\r\n\r\n      against him,\u2014circumstances, things, people. Not an hour passes\r\n\r\n      without bringing some new evidence against him. The examining magistrate\r\n\r\n      is overwhelmed by it\u2014and blind.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrederic Larsan, however, is not a novice,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI thought so,\u201d said Rouletabille, with a slightly contemptuous turn of\r\n\r\n      his lips, \u201cI fancied he was a much abler man. I had, indeed, a great\r\n\r\n      admiration for him, before I got to know his method of working. It\u2019s\r\n\r\n      deplorable. He owes his reputation solely to his ability; but he lacks\r\n\r\n      reasoning power,\u2014the mathematics of his ideas are very poor.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I looked closely at Rouletabille and could not help smiling, on hearing\r\n\r\n      this boy of eighteen talking of a man who had proved to the world that he\r\n\r\n      was the finest police sleuth in Europe.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou smile,\u201d he said? \u201cyou are wrong! I swear I will outwit him\u2014and\r\n\r\n      in a striking way! But I must make haste about it, for he has an enormous\r\n\r\n      start on me\u2014given him by Monsieur Robert Darzac, who is this evening\r\n\r\n      going to increase it still more. Think of it!\u2014every time the\r\n\r\n      murderer comes to the chateau, Monsieur Darzac, by a strange fatality,\r\n\r\n      absents himself and refuses to give any account of how he employs his\r\n\r\n      time.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvery time the assassin comes to the chateau!\u201d I cried. \u201cHas he returned\r\n\r\n      then\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, during that famous night when the strange phenomenon occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was now going to learn about the astonishing phenomenon to which\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had made allusion half an hour earlier without giving me any\r\n\r\n      explanation of it. But I had learned never to press Rouletabille in his\r\n\r\n      narratives. He spoke when the fancy took him and when he judged it to be\r\n\r\n      right. He was less concerned about my curiosity than he was for making a\r\n\r\n      complete summing up for himself of any important matter in which he was\r\n\r\n      interested.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At last, in short rapid phrases, he acquainted me with things which\r\n\r\n      plunged me into a state bordering on complete bewilderment. Indeed, the\r\n\r\n      results of that still unknown science known as hypnotism, for example,\r\n\r\n      were not more inexplicable than the disappearance of the \u201cmatter\u201d of the\r\n\r\n      murderer at the moment when four persons were within touch of him. I speak\r\n\r\n      of hypnotism as I would of electricity, for of the nature of both we are\r\n\r\n      ignorant and we know little of their laws. I cite these examples because,\r\n\r\n      at the time, the case appeared to me to be only explicable by the\r\n\r\n      inexplicable,\u2014that is to say, by an event outside of known natural\r\n\r\n      laws. And yet, if I had had Rouletabille\u2019s brain, I should, like him, have\r\n\r\n      had a presentiment of the natural explanation; for the most curious thing\r\n\r\n      about all the mysteries of the Glandier case was the natural manner in\r\n\r\n      which he explained them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I have among the papers that were sent me by the young man, after the\r\n\r\n      affair was over, a note-book of his, in which a complete account is given\r\n\r\n      of the phenomenon of the disappearance of the \u201cmatter\u201d of the assassin,\r\n\r\n      and the thoughts to which it gave rise in the mind of my young friend. It\r\n\r\n      is preferable, I think, to give the reader this account, rather than\r\n\r\n      continue to reproduce my conversation with Rouletabille; for I should be\r\n\r\n      afraid, in a history of this nature, to add a word that was not in\r\n\r\n      accordance with the strictest truth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XV. The Trap\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      (EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLast night\u2014the night between the 29th and 30th of October\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n       wrote Joseph Rouletabille, \u201cI woke up towards one o\u2019clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n      Was it sleeplessness, or noise without?\u2014The cry of the Bete du Bon\r\n\r\n      Dieu rang out with sinister loudness from the end of the park. I rose and\r\n\r\n      opened the window. Cold wind and rain; opaque darkness; silence. I\r\n\r\n      reclosed my window. Again the sound of the cat\u2019s weird cry in the\r\n\r\n      distance. I partly dressed in haste. The weather was too bad for even a\r\n\r\n      cat to be turned out in it. What did it mean, then\u2014that imitating of\r\n\r\n      the mewing of Mother Angenoux\u2019 cat so near the chateau? I seized a\r\n\r\n      good-sized stick, the only weapon I had, and, without making any noise,\r\n\r\n      opened the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe gallery into which I went was well lit by a lamp with a reflector. I\r\n\r\n      felt a keen current of air and, on turning, found the window open, at the\r\n\r\n      extreme end of the gallery, which I call the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, to\r\n\r\n      distinguish it from the \u2018right\u2019 gallery, on to which the apartment of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson opened. These two galleries cross each other at\r\n\r\n      right angles. Who had left that window open? Or, who had come to open it?\r\n\r\n      I went to the window and leaned out. Five feet below me there was a sort\r\n\r\n      of terrace over the semi-circular projection of a room on the\r\n\r\n      ground-floor. One could, if one wanted, jump from the window on to the\r\n\r\n      terrace, and allow oneself to drop from it into the court of the chateau.\r\n\r\n      Whoever had entered by this road had, evidently, not had a key to the\r\n\r\n      vestibule door. But why should I be thinking of my previous night\u2019s\r\n\r\n      attempt with the ladder?\u2014Because of the open window\u2014left open,\r\n\r\n      perhaps, by the negligence of a servant? I reclosed it, smiling at the\r\n\r\n      ease with which I built a drama on the mere suggestion of an open window.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAgain the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu!\u2014and then silence. The rain\r\n\r\n      ceased to beat on the window. All in the chateau slept. I walked with\r\n\r\n      infinite precaution on the carpet of the gallery. On reaching the corner\r\n\r\n      of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery, I peered round it cautiously. There was another\r\n\r\n      lamp there with a reflector which quite lit up the several objects in it,\u2014three\r\n\r\n      chairs and some pictures hanging on the wall. What was I doing there?\r\n\r\n      Perfect silence reigned throughout. Everything was sunk in repose. What\r\n\r\n      was the instinct that urged me towards Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber?\r\n\r\n      Why did a voice within me cry: \u2018Go on, to the chamber of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson!\u2019 I cast my eyes down upon the carpet on which I was treading\r\n\r\n      and saw that my steps were being directed towards Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s chamber by the marks of steps that had already been made\r\n\r\n      there. Yes, on the carpet were traces of footsteps stained with mud\r\n\r\n      leading to the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson. Horror! Horror!\u2014I\r\n\r\n      recognised in those footprints the impression of the neat boots of the\r\n\r\n      murderer! He had come, then, from without in this wretched night. If you\r\n\r\n      could descend from the gallery by way of the window, by means of the\r\n\r\n      terrace, then you could get into the chateau by the same means.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe murderer was still in the chateau, for here were marks as of\r\n\r\n      returning footsteps. He had entered by the open window at the extremity of\r\n\r\n      the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery; he had passed Frederic Larsan\u2019s door and mine,\r\n\r\n      had turned to the right, and had entered Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room. I\r\n\r\n      am before the door of her ante-room\u2014it is open. I push it, without\r\n\r\n      making the least noise. Under the door of the room itself I see a streak\r\n\r\n      of light. I listen\u2014no sound\u2014not even of breathing! Ah!\u2014if\r\n\r\n      I only knew what was passing in the silence that is behind that door! I\r\n\r\n      find the door locked and the key turned on the inner side. And the\r\n\r\n      murderer is there, perhaps. He must be there! Will he escape this time?\u2014All\r\n\r\n      depends on me!\u2014I must be calm, and above all, I must make no false\r\n\r\n      steps. I must see into that room. I can enter it by Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s drawing-room; but, to do that I should have to cross her\r\n\r\n      boudoir; and while I am there, the murderer may escape by the gallery door\u2014the\r\n\r\n      door in front of which I am now standing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sure that no other crime is being committed, on this night; for\r\n\r\n      there is complete silence in the boudoir, where two nurses are taking care\r\n\r\n      of Mademoiselle Stangerson until she is restored to health.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs I am almost sure that the murderer is there, why do I not at once give\r\n\r\n      the alarm? The murderer may, perhaps, escape; but, perhaps, I may be able\r\n\r\n      to save Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s life. Suppose the murderer on this\r\n\r\n      occasion is not here to murder? The door has been opened to allow him to\r\n\r\n      enter; by whom?\u2014And it has been refastened\u2014by whom?\u2014Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson shuts herself up in her apartment with her nurses every night.\r\n\r\n      Who turned the key of that chamber to allow the murderer to enter?\u2014The\r\n\r\n      nurses,\u2014two faithful domestics? The old chambermaid, Sylvia? It is\r\n\r\n      very improbable. Besides, they slept in the boudoir, and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, very nervous and careful, Monsieur Robert Darzac told me, sees\r\n\r\n      to her own safety since she has been well enough to move about in her\r\n\r\n      room, which I have not yet seen her leave. This nervousness and sudden\r\n\r\n      care on her part, which had struck Monsieur Darzac, had given me, also,\r\n\r\n      food for thought. At the time of the crime in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, there can\r\n\r\n      be no doubt that she expected the murderer. Was he expected this night?\u2014Was\r\n\r\n      it she herself who had opened her door to him? Had she some reason for\r\n\r\n      doing so? Was she obliged to do it?\u2014Was it a meeting for purposes of\r\n\r\n      crime?\u2014Certainly it was not a lover\u2019s meeting, for I believe\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson adores Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll these reflections ran through my brain like a flash of lightning.\r\n\r\n      What would I not give to know!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is possible that there was some reason for the awful silence. My\r\n\r\n      intervention might do more harm than good. How could I tell? How could I\r\n\r\n      know I might not any moment cause another crime? If I could only see and\r\n\r\n      know, without breaking that silence!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI left the ante-room and descended the central stairs to the vestibule\r\n\r\n      and, as silently as possible, made my way to the little room on the\r\n\r\n      ground-floor where Daddy Jacques had been sleeping since the attack made\r\n\r\n      at the pavilion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI found him dressed, his eyes wide open, almost haggard. He did not seem\r\n\r\n      surprised to see me. He told me that he had got up because he had heard\r\n\r\n      the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu, and because he had heard footsteps in the\r\n\r\n      park, close to his window, out of which he had looked and, just then, had\r\n\r\n      seen a black shadow pass by. I asked him whether he had a firearm of any\r\n\r\n      kind. No, he no longer kept one, since the examining magistrate had taken\r\n\r\n      his revolver from him. We went out together, by a little back door, into\r\n\r\n      the park, and stole along the chateau to the point which is just below\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s window.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI placed Daddy Jacques against the wall, ordering him not to stir from\r\n\r\n      the spot, while I, taking advantage of a moment when the moon was hidden\r\n\r\n      by a cloud, moved to the front of the window, out of the patch of light\r\n\r\n      which came from it,\u2014for the window was half-open! If I could only\r\n\r\n      know what was passing in that silent chamber! I returned to Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      and whispered the word \u2018ladder\u2019 in his ear. At first I had thought of the\r\n\r\n      tree which, a week ago, served me for an observatory; but I immediately\r\n\r\n      saw that, from the way the window was half-opened, I should not be able to\r\n\r\n      see from that point of view anything that was passing in the room; and I\r\n\r\n      wanted, not only to see, but to hear, and\u2014to act.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cGreatly agitated, almost trembling, Daddy Jacques disappeared for a\r\n\r\n      moment and returned without the ladder, but making signs to me with his\r\n\r\n      arms, as signals to me to come quickly to him. When I got near him he\r\n\r\n      gasped: \u2018Come!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHe led me round the ch\u00e2teau, past the don-jon. Arrived there, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I went to the donjon in search of my ladder, and in the lower part of\r\n\r\n      the donjon which serves me and the gardener for a lumber room, I found the\r\n\r\n      door open and the ladder gone. On coming out, that\u2019s what I caught sight\r\n\r\n      of by the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd he pointed to the further end of the chateau, where a ladder stood\r\n\r\n      resting against the stone brackets supporting the terrace, under the\r\n\r\n      window which I had found open. The projection of the terrace had prevented\r\n\r\n      my seeing it. Thanks to that ladder, it was quite easy to get into the\r\n\r\n      \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery of the first floor, and I had no doubt of it having\r\n\r\n      been the road taken by the unknown.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe ran to the ladder, but at the moment of reaching it, Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      drew my attention to the half-open door of the little semi-circular room,\r\n\r\n      situated under the terrace, at the extremity of the right wing of the\r\n\r\n      chateau, having the terrace for its roof. Daddy Jacques pushed the door\r\n\r\n      open a little further and looked in.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He\u2019s not there!\u201d he whispered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho is not there?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe forest\u2014keeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      With his lips once more to my ear, he added:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Do you know that he has slept in the upper room of the donjon ever since\r\n\r\n      it was restored?\u2019 And with the same gesture he pointed to the half-open\r\n\r\n      door, the ladder, the terrace, and the windows in the \u2018off-turning\u2019\r\n\r\n      gallery which, a little while before, I had re-closed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat were my thoughts then? I had no time to think. I felt more than I\r\n\r\n      thought.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently, I felt, if the forest-keeper is up there in the chamber (I\r\n\r\n      say, if, because at this moment, apart from the presence of the ladder and\r\n\r\n      his vacant room, there are no evidences which permit me even to suspect\r\n\r\n      him)\u2014if he is there, he has been obliged to pass by the ladder, and\r\n\r\n      the rooms which lie behind his, in his new lodging, are occupied by the\r\n\r\n      family of the steward and by the cook, and by the kitchens, which bar the\r\n\r\n      way by the vestibule to the interior of the chateau. And if he had been\r\n\r\n      there during the evening on any pretext, it would have been easy for him\r\n\r\n      to go into the gallery and see that the window could be simply pushed open\r\n\r\n      from the outside. This question of the unfastened window easily narrowed\r\n\r\n      the field of search for the murderer. He must belong to the house, unless\r\n\r\n      he had an accomplice, which I do not believe he had; unless\u2014unless\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson herself had seen that that window was not fastened\r\n\r\n      from the inside. But, then,\u2014what could be the frightful secret which\r\n\r\n      put her under the necessity of doing away with obstacles that separated\r\n\r\n      her from the murderer?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI seized hold of the ladder, and we returned to the back of the chateau\r\n\r\n      to see if the window of the chamber was still half-open. The blind was\r\n\r\n      drawn but did not join and allowed a bright stream of light to escape and\r\n\r\n      fall upon the path at our feet. I planted the ladder under the window. I\r\n\r\n      am almost sure that I made no noise; and while Daddy Jacques remained at\r\n\r\n      the foot of the ladder, I mounted it, very quietly, my stout stick in my\r\n\r\n      hand. I held my breath and lifted my feet with the greatest care. Suddenly\r\n\r\n      a heavy cloud discharged itself at that moment in a fresh downpour of\r\n\r\n      rain.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt the same instant the sinister cry of the Bete du bon Dieu arrested me\r\n\r\n      in my ascent. It seemed to me to have come from close by me\u2014only a\r\n\r\n      few yards away. Was the cry a signal?\u2014Had some accomplice of the man\r\n\r\n      seen me on the ladder!\u2014Would the cry bring the man to the window?\u2014Perhaps!\r\n\r\n      Ah, there he was at the window! I felt his head above me. I heard the\r\n\r\n      sound of his breath! I could not look up towards him; the least movement\r\n\r\n      of my head, and\u2014I might be lost. Would he see me?\u2014Would he\r\n\r\n      peer into the darkness? No; he went away. He had seen nothing. I felt,\r\n\r\n      rather than heard, him moving on tip-toe in the room; and I mounted a few\r\n\r\n      steps higher. My head reached to the level of the window-sill; my forehead\r\n\r\n      rose above it; my eyes looked between the opening in the blinds\u2014and\r\n\r\n      I saw\u2014A man seated at Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s little desk,\r\n\r\n      writing. His back was turned toward me. A candle was lit before him, and\r\n\r\n      he bent over the flame, the light from it projecting shapeless shadows. I\r\n\r\n      saw nothing but a monstrous, stooping back.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson herself was not there!\u2014Her bed had not been\r\n\r\n      lain on! Where, then, was she sleeping that night? Doubtless in the\r\n\r\n      side-room with her women. Perhaps this was but a guess. I must content\r\n\r\n      myself with the joy of finding the man alone. I must be calm to prepare my\r\n\r\n      trap.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut who, then, is this man writing there before my eyes, seated at the\r\n\r\n      desk, as if he were in his own home? If there had not been that ladder\r\n\r\n      under the window; if there had not been those footprints on the carpet in\r\n\r\n      the gallery; if there had not been that open window, I might have been led\r\n\r\n      to think that this man had a right to be there, and that he was there as a\r\n\r\n      matter of course and for reasons about which as yet I knew nothing. But\r\n\r\n      there was no doubt that this mysterious unknown was the man of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room,\u2014the man to whose murderous assault Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014without\r\n\r\n      denouncing him\u2014had had to submit. If I could but see his face!\r\n\r\n      Surprise and capture him!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I spring into the room at this moment, he will escape by the\r\n\r\n      right-hand door opening into the boudoir,\u2014or crossing the\r\n\r\n      drawing-room, he will reach the gallery and I shall lose him. I have him\r\n\r\n      now and in five minutes more he\u2019ll be safer than if I had him in a cage.\u2014What\r\n\r\n      is he doing there, alone in Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room?\u2014What is\r\n\r\n      he writing? I descend and place the ladder on the ground. Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      follows me. We re-enter the chateau. I send Daddy Jacques to wake Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, and instruct him to await my coming in Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s room and to say nothing definite to him before my arrival. I\r\n\r\n      will go and awaken Frederic Larsan. It\u2019s a bore to have to do it, for I\r\n\r\n      should have liked to work alone and to have carried off all the honors of\r\n\r\n      this affair myself, right under the very nose of the sleeping detective.\r\n\r\n      But Daddy Jacques and Monsieur Stangerson are old men, and I am not yet\r\n\r\n      fully developed. I might not be strong enough. Larsan is used to wrestling\r\n\r\n      and putting on the handcuffs. He opened his eyes swollen with sleep, ready\r\n\r\n      to send me flying, without in the least believing in my reporter\u2019s\r\n\r\n      fancies. I had to assure him that the man was there!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That\u2019s strange!\u2019 he said; \u2018I thought I left him this afternoon in\r\n\r\n      Paris.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe dressed himself in haste and armed himself with a revolver. We stole\r\n\r\n      quietly into the gallery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where is he?\u2019 Larsan asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And\u2014Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018She is not in there.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s go in.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t go there! On the least alarm the man will escape. He has four ways\r\n\r\n      by which to do it\u2014the door, the window, the boudoir, or the room in\r\n\r\n      which the women are sleeping.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll draw him from below.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And if you fail?\u2014If you only succeed in wounding him\u2014he\u2019ll\r\n\r\n      escape again, without reckoning that he is certainly armed. No, let me\r\n\r\n      direct the expedition, and I\u2019ll answer for everything.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018As you like,\u2019 he replied, with fairly good grace.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen, after satisfying myself that all the windows of the two galleries\r\n\r\n      were thoroughly secure, I placed Frederic Larsan at the end of the\r\n\r\n      \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, before the window which I had found open and had\r\n\r\n      reclosed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Under no consideration,\u2019 I said to him, \u2018must you stir from this post\r\n\r\n      till I call you. The chances are even that the man, when he is pursued,\r\n\r\n      will return to this window and try to save himself that way; for it is by\r\n\r\n      that way he came in and made a way ready for his flight. You have a\r\n\r\n      dangerous post.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What will be yours?\u2019 asked Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I shall spring into the room and knock him over for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Take my revolver,\u2019 said Fred, \u2018and I\u2019ll take your stick.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Thanks,\u2019 I said; \u2018You are a brave man.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI accepted his offer. I was going to be alone with the man in the room\r\n\r\n      writing and was really thankful to have the weapon.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI left Fred, having posted him at the window (No. 5 on the plan), and,\r\n\r\n      with the greatest precaution, went towards Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s apartment\r\n\r\n      in the left wing of the chateau. I found him with Daddy Jacques, who had\r\n\r\n      faithfully obeyed my directions, confining himself to asking his master to\r\n\r\n      dress as quickly as possible. In a few words I explained to Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson what was passing. He armed himself with a revolver, followed\r\n\r\n      me, and we were all three speedily in the gallery. Since I had seen the\r\n\r\n      murderer seated at the desk ten minutes had elapsed. Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n      wished to spring upon the assassin at once and kill him. I made him\r\n\r\n      understand that, above all, he must not, in his desire to kill him, miss\r\n\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I had sworn to him that his daughter was not in the room, and in no\r\n\r\n      danger, he conquered his impatience and left me to direct the operations.\r\n\r\n      I told them that they must come to me the moment I called to them, or when\r\n\r\n      I fired my revolver. I then sent Daddy Jacques to place himself before the\r\n\r\n      window at the end of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery. (No. 2 on my plan.) I chose that\r\n\r\n      position \u2018for Daddy Jacques because I believed that the murderer, tracked,\r\n\r\n      on leaving the room, would run through the gallery towards the window\r\n\r\n      which he had left open, and, instantly seeing that it was guarded by\r\n\r\n      Larsan, would pursue his course along the \u2018right\u2019 gallery. There he would\r\n\r\n      encounter Daddy Jacques, who would prevent his springing out of the window\r\n\r\n      into the park. Under that window there was a sort of buttress, while all\r\n\r\n      the other windows in the galleries were at such a height from the ground\r\n\r\n      that it was almost impossible to jump from them without breaking one\u2019s\r\n\r\n      neck. All the doors and windows, including those of the lumber-room at the\r\n\r\n      end of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery\u2014as I had rapidly assured myself\u2014were\r\n\r\n      strongly secured.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHaving indicated to Daddy Jacques the post he was to occupy, and having\r\n\r\n      seen him take up his position, I placed Monsieur Stangerson on the landing\r\n\r\n      at the head of the stairs not far from the door of his daughter\u2019s\r\n\r\n      ante-room, rather than the boudoir, where the women were, and the door of\r\n\r\n      which must have been locked by Mademoiselle Stangerson herself if, as I\r\n\r\n      thought, she had taken refuge in the boudoir for the purpose of avoiding\r\n\r\n      the murderer who was coming to see her. In any case, he must return to the\r\n\r\n      gallery where my people were awaiting him at every possible exit.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn coming there, he would see on his left, Monsieur Stangerson; he would\r\n\r\n      turn to the right, towards the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery\u2014the way he had\r\n\r\n      pre-arranged for flight, where, at the intersection of the two galleries,\r\n\r\n      he would see at once, as I have explained, on his left, Frederic Larsan at\r\n\r\n      the end of the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, and in front, Daddy Jacques, at the\r\n\r\n      end of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery. Monsieur Stangerson and myself would arrive by\r\n\r\n      way of the back of the chateau.\u2014He is ours!\u2014He can no longer\r\n\r\n      escape us! I was sure of that.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe plan I had formed seemed to me the best, the surest, and the most\r\n\r\n      simple. It would, no doubt, have been simpler still, if we had been able\r\n\r\n      to place some one directly behind the door of Mademoiselle\u2019s boudoir,\r\n\r\n      which opened out of her bedchamber, and, in that way, had been in a\r\n\r\n      position to besiege the two doors of the room in which the man was. But we\r\n\r\n      could not penetrate the boudoir except by way of the drawing-room, the\r\n\r\n      door of which had been locked on the inside by Mademoiselle Stangerson.\r\n\r\n      But even if I had had the free disposition of the boudoir, I should have\r\n\r\n      held to the plan I had formed; because any other plan of attack would have\r\n\r\n      separated us at the moment of the struggle with the man, while my plan\r\n\r\n      united us all for the attack, at a spot which I had selected with almost\r\n\r\n      mathematical precision,\u2014the intersection of the two galleries.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHaving so placed my people, I again left the chateau, hurried to my\r\n\r\n      ladder, and, replacing it, climbed up, revolver in hand.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf there be any inclined to smile at my taking so many precautionary\r\n\r\n      measures, I refer them to the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, and to all the\r\n\r\n      proofs we have of the weird cunning of the murderer. Further, if there be\r\n\r\n      some who think my observations needlessly minute at a moment when they\r\n\r\n      ought to be completely held by rapidity of movement and decision of\r\n\r\n      action, I reply that I have wished to report here, at length and\r\n\r\n      completely, all the details of a plan of attack conceived so rapidly that\r\n\r\n      it is only the slowness of my pen that gives an appearance of slowness to\r\n\r\n      the execution. I have wished, by this slowness and precision, to be\r\n\r\n      certain that nothing should be omitted from the conditions under which the\r\n\r\n      strange phenomenon was produced, which, until some natural explanation of\r\n\r\n      it is forthcoming, seems to me to prove, even better than the theories of\r\n\r\n      Professor Stangerson, the Dissociation of Matter\u2014I will even say,\r\n\r\n      the instantaneous Dissociation of Matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVI. Strange Phenomenon of the Dissociation of Matter\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      (EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, continued)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am again at the window-sill,\u201d continues Rouletabille, \u201cand once more I\r\n\r\n      raise my head above it. Through an opening in the curtains, the\r\n\r\n      arrangement of which has not been changed, I am ready to look, anxious to\r\n\r\n      note the position in which I am going to find the murderer,\u2014whether\r\n\r\n      his back will still be turned towards me!\u2014whether he is still seated\r\n\r\n      at the desk writing! But perhaps\u2014perhaps\u2014he is no longer\r\n\r\n      there!\u2014Yet how could he have fled?\u2014Was I not in possession of\r\n\r\n      his ladder? I force myself to be cool. I raise my head yet higher. I look\u2014he\r\n\r\n      is still there. I see his monstrous back, deformed by the shadow thrown by\r\n\r\n      the candle. He is no longer writing now, and the candle is on the parquet,\r\n\r\n      over which he is bending\u2014a position which serves my purpose.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hold my breath. I mount the ladder. I am on the uppermost rung of it,\r\n\r\n      and with my left hand seize hold of the window-sill. In this moment of\r\n\r\n      approaching success, I feel my heart beating wildly. I put my revolver\r\n\r\n      between my teeth. A quick spring, and I shall be on the window-ledge. But\u2014the\r\n\r\n      ladder! I had been obliged to press on it heavily, and my foot had\r\n\r\n      scarcely left it, when I felt it swaying beneath me. It grated on the wall\r\n\r\n      and fell. But, already, my knees were touching the window-sill, and, by a\r\n\r\n      movement quick as lightning, I got on to it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the murderer had been even quicker than I had been. He had heard the\r\n\r\n      grating of the ladder on the wall, and I saw the monstrous back of the man\r\n\r\n      raise itself. I saw his head. Did I really see it?\u2014The candle on the\r\n\r\n      parquet lit up his legs only. Above the height of the table the chamber\r\n\r\n      was in darkness. I saw a man with long hair, a full beard, wild-looking\r\n\r\n      eyes, a pale face, framed in large whiskers,\u2014as well as I could\r\n\r\n      distinguish, and, as I think\u2014red in colour. I did not know the face.\r\n\r\n      That was, in brief, the chief sensation I received from that face in the\r\n\r\n      dim half-light in which I saw it. I did not know it\u2014or, at least, I\r\n\r\n      did not recognise it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow for quick action! It was indeed time for that, for as I was about to\r\n\r\n      place my legs through the window, the man had seen me, had bounded to his\r\n\r\n      feet, had sprung\u2014as I foresaw he would\u2014to the door of the\r\n\r\n      ante-chamber, had time to open it, and fled. But I was already behind him,\r\n\r\n      revolver in hand, shouting \u2018Help!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLike an arrow I crossed the room, but noticed a letter on the table as I\r\n\r\n      rushed. I almost came up with the man in the ante-room, for he had lost\r\n\r\n      time in opening the door to the gallery. I flew on wings, and in the\r\n\r\n      gallery was but a few feet behind him. He had taken, as I supposed he\r\n\r\n      would, the gallery on his right,\u2014that is to say, the road he had\r\n\r\n      prepared for his flight. \u2018Help, Jacques!\u2014help, Larsan!\u2019 I cried. He\r\n\r\n      could not escape us! I raised a shout of joy, of savage victory. The man\r\n\r\n      reached the intersection of the two galleries hardly two seconds before me\r\n\r\n      for the meeting which I had prepared\u2014the fatal shock which must\r\n\r\n      inevitably take place at that spot! We all rushed to the crossing-place\u2014Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and I coming from one end of the right gallery, Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      coming from the other end of the same gallery, and Frederic Larsan coming\r\n\r\n      from the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man was not there!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe looked at each other stupidly and with eyes terrified. The man had\r\n\r\n      vanished like a ghost. \u2018Where is he\u2014where is he?\u2019 we all asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It is impossible he can have escaped!\u2019 I cried, my terror mastered by my\r\n\r\n      anger.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I touched him!\u2019 exclaimed Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I felt his breath on my face!\u2019 cried Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where is he?\u2019\u2014where is he?\u2019 we all cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe raced like madmen along the two galleries; we visited doors and\r\n\r\n      windows\u2014they were closed, hermetically closed. They had not been\r\n\r\n      opened. Besides, the opening of a door or window by this man whom we were\r\n\r\n      hunting, without our having perceived it, would have been more\r\n\r\n      inexplicable than his disappearance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere is he?\u2014where is he?\u2014He could not have got away by a\r\n\r\n      door or a window, nor by any other way. He could not have passed through\r\n\r\n      our bodies!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI confess that, for the moment, I felt \u2018done for.\u2019 For the gallery was\r\n\r\n      perfectly lighted, and there was neither trap, nor secret door in the\r\n\r\n      walls, nor any sort of hiding-place. We moved the chairs and lifted the\r\n\r\n      pictures. Nothing!\u2014nothing! We would have looked into a flower-pot,\r\n\r\n      if there had been one to look into!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      When this mystery, thanks to Rouletabille, was naturally explained, by the\r\n\r\n      help alone of his masterful mind, we were able to realise that the\r\n\r\n      murderer had got away neither by a door, a window, nor the stairs\u2014a\r\n\r\n      fact which the judges would not admit.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVII. The Inexplicable Gallery\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson appeared at the door of her ante-room,\u201d continues\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s note-book. \u201cWe were near her door in the gallery where this\r\n\r\n      incredible phenomenon had taken place. There are moments when one feels as\r\n\r\n      if one\u2019s brain were about to burst. A bullet in the head, a fracture of\r\n\r\n      the skull, the seat of reason shattered\u2014with only these can I\r\n\r\n      compare the sensation which exhausted and left me void of sense.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHappily, Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared on the threshold of her\r\n\r\n      ante-room. I saw her, and that helped to relieve my chaotic state of mind.\r\n\r\n      I breathed her\u2014I inhaled the perfume of the lady in black, whom I\r\n\r\n      should never see again. I would have given ten years of my life\u2014half\r\n\r\n      my life\u2014to see once more the lady in black! Alas! I no more meet her\r\n\r\n      but from time to time,\u2014and yet!\u2014and yet! how the memory of\r\n\r\n      that perfume\u2014felt by me alone\u2014carries me back to the days of\r\n\r\n      my childhood.* It was this sharp reminder from my beloved perfume, of the\r\n\r\n      lady in black, which made me go to her\u2014dressed wholly in white and\r\n\r\n      so pale\u2014so pale and so beautiful!\u2014on the threshold of the\r\n\r\n      inexplicable gallery. Her beautiful golden hair, gathered into a knot on\r\n\r\n      the back of her neck, left visible the red star on her temple which had so\r\n\r\n      nearly been the cause of her death. When I first got on the right track of\r\n\r\n      the mystery of this case I had imagined that, on the night of the tragedy\r\n\r\n      in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, Mademoiselle Stangerson had worn her hair in bands.\r\n\r\n      But then, how could I have imagined otherwise when I had not been in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut now, since the occurrence of the inexplicable gallery, I did not\r\n\r\n      reason at all. I stood there, stupid, before the apparition\u2014so pale\r\n\r\n      and so beautiful\u2014of Mademoiselle Stangerson. She was clad in a\r\n\r\n      dressing-gown of dreamy white. One might have taken her to be a ghost\u2014a\r\n\r\n      lovely phantom. Her father took her in his arms and kissed her\r\n\r\n      passionately, as if he had recovered her after being long lost to him. I\r\n\r\n      dared not question her. He drew her into the room and we followed them,\u2014for\r\n\r\n      we had to know!\u2014The door of the boudoir was open. The terrified\r\n\r\n      faces of the two nurses craned towards us. Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      inquired the meaning of all the disturbance. That she was not in her own\r\n\r\n      room was quite easily explained\u2014quite easily. She had a fancy not to\r\n\r\n      sleep that night in her chamber, but in the boudoir with her nurses,\r\n\r\n      locking the door on them. Since the night of the crime she had experienced\r\n\r\n      feelings of terror, and fears came over her that are easily to be\r\n\r\n      comprehended.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut who could imagine that on that particular night when he was to come,\r\n\r\n      she would, by a mere chance, determine to shut herself in with her women?\r\n\r\n      Who would think that she would act contrary to her father\u2019s wish to sleep\r\n\r\n      in the drawing-room? Who could believe that the letter which had so\r\n\r\n      recently been on the table in her room would no longer be there? He who\r\n\r\n      could understand all this, would have to assume that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson knew that the murderer was coming\u2014she could not prevent\r\n\r\n      his coming again\u2014unknown to her father, unknown to all but to\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac. For he must know it now\u2014perhaps he had known\r\n\r\n      it before! Did he remember that phrase in the Elysee garden: \u2018Must I\r\n\r\n      commit a crime, then, to win you?\u2019 Against whom the crime, if not against\r\n\r\n      the obstacle, against the murderer? \u2018Ah, I would kill him with my own\r\n\r\n      hand!\u2019 And I replied, \u2018You have not answered my question.\u2019 That was the\r\n\r\n      very truth. In truth, in truth, Monsieur Darzac knew the murderer so well\r\n\r\n      that\u2014while wishing to kill him himself\u2014he was afraid I should\r\n\r\n      find him. There could be but two reasons why he had assisted me in my\r\n\r\n      investigation. First, because I forced him to do it; and, second, because\r\n\r\n      she would be the better protected.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am in the chamber\u2014her room. I look at her, also at the place\r\n\r\n      where the letter had just now been. She has possessed herself of it; it\r\n\r\n      was evidently intended for her\u2014evidently. How she trembles!\u2014Trembles\r\n\r\n      at the strange story her father is telling her, of the presence of the\r\n\r\n      murderer in her chamber, and of the pursuit. But it is plainly to be seen\r\n\r\n      that she is not wholly satisfied by the assurance given her until she had\r\n\r\n      been told that the murderer, by some incomprehensible means, had been able\r\n\r\n      to elude us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen follows a silence. What a silence! We are all there\u2014looking at\r\n\r\n      her\u2014her father, Larsan, Daddy Jacques and I. What were we all\r\n\r\n      thinking of in the silence? After the events of that night, of the mystery\r\n\r\n      of the inexplicable gallery, of the prodigious fact of the presence of the\r\n\r\n      murderer in her room, it seemed to me that all our thoughts might have\r\n\r\n      been translated into the words which were addressed to her. \u2018You who know\r\n\r\n      of this mystery, explain it to us, and we shall perhaps be able to save\r\n\r\n      you. How I longed to save her\u2014for herself, and, from the other!\u2014It\r\n\r\n      brought the tears to my eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is there, shedding about her the perfume of the lady in black. At\r\n\r\n      last, I see her, in the silence of her chamber. Since the fatal hour of\r\n\r\n      the mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, we have hung about this invisible and\r\n\r\n      silent woman to learn what she knows. Our desires, our wish to know must\r\n\r\n      be a torment to her. Who can tell that, should we learn the secret of her\r\n\r\n      mystery, it would not precipitate a tragedy more terrible than that which\r\n\r\n      had already been enacted here? Who can tell if it might not mean her\r\n\r\n      death? Yet it had brought her close to death,\u2014and we still knew\r\n\r\n      nothing. Or, rather, there are some of us who know nothing. But I\u2014if\r\n\r\n      I knew who, I should know all. Who?\u2014Who?\u2014Not knowing who, I\r\n\r\n      must remain silent, out of pity for her. For there is no doubt that she\r\n\r\n      knows how he escaped from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, and yet she keeps the secret.\r\n\r\n      When I know who, I will speak to him\u2014to him!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe looked at us now\u2014with a far-away look in her eyes\u2014as if\r\n\r\n      we were not in the chamber. Monsieur Stangerson broke the silence. He\r\n\r\n      declared that, henceforth, he would no more absent himself from his\r\n\r\n      daughter\u2019s apartments. She tried to oppose him in vain. He adhered firmly\r\n\r\n      to his purpose. He would install himself there this very night, he said.\r\n\r\n      Solely concerned for the health of his daughter, he reproached her for\r\n\r\n      having left her bed. Then he suddenly began talking to her as if she were\r\n\r\n      a little child. He smiled at her and seemed not to know either what he\r\n\r\n      said or what he did. The illustrious professor had lost his head.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson in a tone of tender distress said: \u2018Father!\u2014father!\u2019\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques blows his nose, and Frederic Larsan himself is obliged to\r\n\r\n      turn away to hide his emotion. For myself, I am able neither to think or\r\n\r\n      feel. I felt an infinite contempt for myself.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was the first time that Frederic Larsan, like myself, found himself\r\n\r\n      face to face with Mademoiselle Stangerson since the attack in The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room. Like me, he had insisted on being allowed to question the unhappy\r\n\r\n      lady; but he had not, any more than had I, been permitted. To him, as to\r\n\r\n      me, the same answer had always been given: Mademoiselle Stangerson was too\r\n\r\n      weak to receive us. The questionings of the examining magistrate had\r\n\r\n      over-fatigued her. It was evidently intended not to give us any assistance\r\n\r\n      in our researches. I was not surprised; but Frederic Larsan had always\r\n\r\n      resented this conduct. It is true that he and I had a totally different\r\n\r\n      theory of the crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI still catch myself repeating from the depths of my heart: \u2018Save her!\u2014save\r\n\r\n      her without his speaking!\u2019 Who is he\u2014the murderer? Take him and shut\r\n\r\n      his mouth. But Monsieur Darzac made it clear that in order to shut his\r\n\r\n      mouth he must be killed. Have I the right to kill Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s murderer? No, I had not. But let him only give me the chance!\r\n\r\n      Let me find out whether he is really a creature of flesh and blood!\u2014Let\r\n\r\n      me see his dead body, since it cannot be taken alive.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I could but make this woman, who does not even look at us, understand!\r\n\r\n      She is absorbed by her fears and by her father\u2019s distress of mind. And I\r\n\r\n      can do nothing to save her. Yes, I will go to work once more and\r\n\r\n      accomplish wonders.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI move towards her. I would speak to her. I would entreat her to have\r\n\r\n      confidence in me. I would, in a word, make her understand\u2014she alone\u2014that\r\n\r\n      I know how the murderer escaped from \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d\u2014that I have\r\n\r\n      guessed the motives for her secrecy\u2014and that I pity her with all my\r\n\r\n      heart. But by her gestures she begged us to leave her alone, expressing\r\n\r\n      weariness and the need for immediate rest. Monsieur Stangerson asked us to\r\n\r\n      go back to our rooms and thanked us. Frederic Larsan and I bowed to him\r\n\r\n      and, followed by Daddy Jacques, we regained the gallery. I heard Larsan\r\n\r\n      murmur: \u2018Strange! strange!\u2019 He made a sign to me to go with him into his\r\n\r\n      room. On the threshold he turned towards Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Did you see him distinctly?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Who?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The man?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Saw him!\u2014why, he had a big red beard and red hair.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That\u2019s how he appeared to me,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And to me,\u2019 said Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe great Fred and I were alone in his chamber, now, to talk over this\r\n\r\n      thing. We talked for an hour, turning the matter over and viewing it from\r\n\r\n      every side. From the questions put by him, from the explanation which he\r\n\r\n      gives me, it is clear to me that\u2014in spite of all our senses\u2014he\r\n\r\n      is persuaded the man disappeared by some secret passage in the chateau\r\n\r\n      known to him alone.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He knows the chateau,\u2019 he said to me; \u2018he knows it well.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He is a rather tall man\u2014well-built,\u2019 I suggested.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He is as tall as he wants to be,\u2019 murmured Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I understand,\u2019 I said; \u2018but how do you account for his red hair and\r\n\r\n      beard?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Too much beard\u2014too much hair\u2014false,\u2019 says Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That\u2019s easily said. You are always thinking of Robert Darzac. You can\u2019t\r\n\r\n      get rid of that idea? I am certain that he is innocent.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018So much the better. I hope so; but everything condemns him. Did you\r\n\r\n      notice the marks on the carpet?\u2014Come and look at them.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I have seen them; they are the marks of the neat boots, the same as\r\n\r\n      those we saw on the border of the lake.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Can you deny that they belong to Robert Darzac?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Of course, one may be mistaken.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Have you noticed that those footprints only go in one direction?\u2014that\r\n\r\n      there are no return marks? When the man came from the chamber, pursued by\r\n\r\n      all of us, his footsteps left no traces behind them.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He had, perhaps, been in the chamber for hours. The mud from his boots\r\n\r\n      had dried, and he moved with such rapidity on the points of his toes\u2014We\r\n\r\n      saw him running, but we did not hear his steps.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI suddenly put an end to this idle chatter\u2014void of any logic, and\r\n\r\n      made a sign to Larsan to listen.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018There\u2014below; some one is shutting a door.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI rise; Larsan follows me; we descend to the ground-floor of the chateau.\r\n\r\n      I lead him to the little semi-circular room under the terrace beneath the\r\n\r\n      window of the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery. I point to the door, now closed, open\r\n\r\n      a short time before, under which a shaft of light is visible.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The forest-keeper!\u2019 says Fred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Come on!\u2019 I whisper.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrepared\u2014I know not why\u2014to believe that the keeper is the\r\n\r\n      guilty man\u2014I go to the door and rap smartly on it. Some might think\r\n\r\n      that we were rather late in thinking of the keeper, since our first\r\n\r\n      business, after having found that the murderer had escaped us in the\r\n\r\n      gallery, ought to have been to search everywhere else,\u2014around the\r\n\r\n      chateau,\u2014in the park\u2014\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHad this criticism been made at the time, we could only have answered\r\n\r\n      that the assassin had disappeared from the gallery in such a way that we\r\n\r\n      thought he was no longer anywhere! He had eluded us when we all had our\r\n\r\n      hands stretched out ready to seize him\u2014when we were almost touching\r\n\r\n      him. We had no longer any ground for hoping that we could clear up the\r\n\r\n      mystery of that night.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs soon as I rapped at the door it was opened, and the keeper asked us\r\n\r\n      quietly what we wanted. He was undressed and preparing to go to bed. The\r\n\r\n      bed had not yet been disturbed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe entered and I affected surprise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Not gone to bed yet?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 he replied roughly. \u2018I have been making a round of the park and in\r\n\r\n      the woods. I am only just back\u2014and sleepy. Good-night!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Listen,\u2019 I said. \u2018An hour or so ago, there was a ladder close by your\r\n\r\n      window.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What ladder?\u2014I did not see any ladder. Good-night!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd he simply put us out of the room. When we were outside I looked at\r\n\r\n      Larsan. His face was impenetrable.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well?\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Well?\u2019 he repeated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Does that open out any new view to you?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was no mistaking Larsan\u2019s bad temper. On re-entering the chateau, I\r\n\r\n      heard him mutter:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It would be strange\u2014very strange\u2014if I had deceived myself on\r\n\r\n      that point!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe seemed to be talking to me rather than to himself. He added: \u2018In any\r\n\r\n      case, we shall soon know what to think. The morning will bring light with\r\n\r\n      it.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XVIII. Rouletabille Has Drawn a Circle Between the Two Bumps on\r\n\r\n      His Forehead\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      (EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, continued)\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe separated on the thresholds of our rooms, with a melancholy shake of\r\n\r\n      the hands. I was glad to have aroused in him a suspicion of error. His was\r\n\r\n      an original brain, very intelligent but\u2014without method. I did not go\r\n\r\n      to bed. I awaited the coming of daylight and then went down to the front\r\n\r\n      of the chateau, and made a detour, examining every trace of footsteps\r\n\r\n      coming towards it or going from it. These, however, were so mixed and\r\n\r\n      confusing that I could make nothing of them. Here I may make a remark,\u2014I\r\n\r\n      am not accustomed to attach an exaggerated importance to exterior signs\r\n\r\n      left in the track of a crime.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe method which traces the criminal by means of the tracks of his\r\n\r\n      footsteps is altogether primitive. So many footprints are identical.\r\n\r\n      However, in the disturbed state of my mind, I did go into the deserted\r\n\r\n      court and did look at all the footprints I could find there, seeking for\r\n\r\n      some indication, as a basis for reasoning.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf I could but find a right starting-point! In despair I seated myself on\r\n\r\n      a stone. For over an hour I busied myself with the common, ordinary work\r\n\r\n      of a policeman. Like the least intelligent of detectives I went on blindly\r\n\r\n      over the traces of footprints which told me just no more than they could.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI came to the conclusion that I was a fool, lower in the scale of\r\n\r\n      intelligence than even the police of the modern romancer. Novelists build\r\n\r\n      mountains of stupidity out of a footprint on the sand, or from an\r\n\r\n      impression of a hand on the wall. That\u2019s the way innocent men are brought\r\n\r\n      to prison. It might convince an examining magistrate or the head of a\r\n\r\n      detective department, but it\u2019s not proof. You writers forget that what the\r\n\r\n      senses furnish is not proof. If I am taking cognisance of what is offered\r\n\r\n      me by my senses I do so but to bring the results within the circle of my\r\n\r\n      reason. That circle may be the most circumscribed, but if it is, it has\r\n\r\n      this advantage\u2014it holds nothing but the truth! Yes, I swear that I\r\n\r\n      have never used the evidence of the senses but as servants to my reason. I\r\n\r\n      have never permitted them to become my master. They have not made of me\r\n\r\n      that monstrous thing,\u2014worse than a blind man,\u2014a man who sees\r\n\r\n      falsely. And that is why I can triumph over your error and your merely\r\n\r\n      animal intelligence, Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBe of good courage, then, friend Rouletabille; it is impossible that the\r\n\r\n      incident of the inexplicable gallery should be outside the circle of your\r\n\r\n      reason. You know that! Then have faith and take thought with yourself and\r\n\r\n      forget not that you took hold of the right end when you drew that circle\r\n\r\n      in your brain within which to unravel this mysterious play of\r\n\r\n      circumstance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo it, once again! Go\u2014back to the gallery. Take your stand on your\r\n\r\n      reason and rest there as Frederic Larsan rests on his cane. You will then\r\n\r\n      soon prove that the great Fred is nothing but a fool.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201430th October.

With head on fire, I retraced my way to the\r\n\r\n      gallery, and without having found anything more than I had seen on the\r\n\r\n      previous night, the right hold I had taken of my reason drew me to\r\n\r\n      something so important that I was obliged to cling to it to save myself\r\n\r\n      from falling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow for the strength and patience to find sensible traces to fit in with\r\n\r\n      my thinking\u2014and these must come within the circle I have drawn\r\n\r\n      between the two bumps on my forehead!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201430th of October. Midnight.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJOSEPH ROULETABILLE.\u201d \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XIX. Rouletabille Invites Me to Breakfast at the Donjon Inn\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was not until later that Rouletabille sent me the note-book in which he\r\n\r\n      had written at length the story of the phenomenon of the inexplicable\r\n\r\n      gallery. On the day I arrived at the Glandier and joined him in his room,\r\n\r\n      he recounted to me, with the greatest detail, all that I have now related,\r\n\r\n      telling me also how he had spent several hours in Paris where he had\r\n\r\n      learned nothing that could be of any help to him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The event of the inexplicable gallery had occurred on the night between\r\n\r\n      the 29th and 30th of October, that is to say, three days before my return\r\n\r\n      to the chateau. It was on the 2nd of November, then, that I went back to\r\n\r\n      the Glandier, summoned there by my friend\u2019s telegram, and taking the\r\n\r\n      revolvers with me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I am now in Rouletabille\u2019s room and he has finished his recital.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      While he had been telling me the story I noticed him continually rubbing\r\n\r\n      the glass of the eyeglasses he had found on the side table. From the\r\n\r\n      evident pleasure he was taking in handling them I felt they must be one of\r\n\r\n      those sensible evidences destined to enter what he had called the circle\r\n\r\n      of the right end of his reason. That strange and unique way of his, to\r\n\r\n      express himself in terms wonderfully adequate for his thoughts, no longer\r\n\r\n      surprised me. It was often necessary to know his thought to understand the\r\n\r\n      terms he used; and it was not easy to penetrate into Rouletabille\u2019s\r\n\r\n      thinking.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This lad\u2019s brain was one of the most curious things I have ever observed.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille went on the even tenor of his way without suspecting the\r\n\r\n      astonishment and even bewilderment he roused in others. I am sure he was\r\n\r\n      not himself in the least conscious of the originality of his genius. He\r\n\r\n      was himself and at ease wherever he happened to be.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When he had finished his recital he asked me what I thought of it. I\r\n\r\n      replied that I was much puzzled by his question. Then he begged me to try,\r\n\r\n      in my turn, to take my reason in hand \u201cby the right end.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seems to me that the point of departure of my\r\n\r\n      reason would be this\u2014there can be no doubt that the murderer you\r\n\r\n      pursued was in the gallery.\u201d I paused.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter making so good a start, you ought not to stop so soon,\u201d he\r\n\r\n      exclaimed. \u201cCome, make another effort.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll try. Since he disappeared from the gallery without passing through\r\n\r\n      any door or window, he must have escaped by some other opening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at me pityingly, smiled carelessly, and remarked that\r\n\r\n      I was reasoning like a postman, or\u2014like Frederic Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had alternate fits of admiration and disdain for the great\r\n\r\n      Fred. It all depended as to whether Larsan\u2019s discoveries tallied with\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s reasoning or not. When they did he would exclaim: \u201cHe is\r\n\r\n      really great!\u201d When they did not he would grunt and mutter, \u201cWhat an ass!\u201d\r\n\r\n       It was a petty side of the noble character of this strange youth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We had risen, and he led me into the park. When we reached the court and\r\n\r\n      were making towards the gate, the sound of blinds thrown back against the\r\n\r\n      wall made us turn our heads, and we saw, at a window on the first floor of\r\n\r\n      the chateau, the ruddy and clean shaven face of a person I did not\r\n\r\n      recognise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHullo!\u201d muttered Rouletabille. \u201cArthur Rance!\u201d\u2014He lowered his head,\r\n\r\n      quickened his pace, and I heard him ask himself between his teeth: \u201cWas he\r\n\r\n      in the chateau that night? What is he doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We had gone some distance from the chateau when I asked him who this\r\n\r\n      Arthur Rance was, and how he had come to know him. He referred to his\r\n\r\n      story of that morning and I remembered that Mr. Arthur W. Rance was the\r\n\r\n      American from Philadelphia with whom he had had so many drinks at the\r\n\r\n      Elysee reception.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut was he not to have left France almost immediately?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt; that\u2019s why I am surprised to find him here still, and not only\r\n\r\n      in France, but above all, at the Glandier. He did not arrive this morning;\r\n\r\n      and he did not get here last night. He must have got here before dinner,\r\n\r\n      then. Why didn\u2019t the concierges tell me?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I reminded my friend, apropos of the concierges, that he had not yet told\r\n\r\n      me what had led him to get them set at liberty.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were close to their lodge. Monsieur and Madame Bernier saw us coming. A\r\n\r\n      frank smile lit up their happy faces. They seemed to harbour no\r\n\r\n      ill-feeling because of their detention. My young friend asked them at what\r\n\r\n      hour Mr. Arthur Rance had arrived. They answered that they did not know he\r\n\r\n      was at the chateau. He must have come during the evening of the previous\r\n\r\n      night, but they had not had to open the gate for him, because, being a\r\n\r\n      great walker, and not wishing that a carriage should be sent to meet him,\r\n\r\n      he was accustomed to get off at the little hamlet of Saint-Michel, from\r\n\r\n      which he came to the chateau by way of the forest. He reached the park by\r\n\r\n      the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve, over the little gate of which, giving on\r\n\r\n      to the park, he climbed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As the concierges spoke, I saw Rouletabille\u2019s face cloud over and exhibit\r\n\r\n      disappointment\u2014a disappointment, no doubt, with himself. Evidently\r\n\r\n      he was a little vexed, after having worked so much on the spot, with so\r\n\r\n      minute a study of the people and events at the Glandier, that he had to\r\n\r\n      learn now that Arthur Rance was accustomed to visit the chateau.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou say that Monsieur Arthur Rance is accustomed to come to the chateau.\r\n\r\n      When did he come here last?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you exactly,\u201d replied Madame Bernier\u2014that was the\r\n\r\n      name of the concierge\u2014\u201cwe couldn\u2019t know while they were keeping us\r\n\r\n      in prison. Besides, as the gentleman comes to the chateau without passing\r\n\r\n      through our gate he goes away by the way he comes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you know when he came the first time?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh yes, Monsieur!\u2014nine years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe was in France nine years ago, then,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cand, since\r\n\r\n      that time, as far as you know, how many times has he been at the\r\n\r\n      Glandier?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThree times.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen did he come the last time, as far as you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA week before the attempt in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille put another question\u2014this time addressing himself\r\n\r\n      particularly to the woman:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the grove of the parquet?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the grove of the parquet,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThanks!\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cBe ready for me this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He spoke the last words with a finger on his lips as if to command silence\r\n\r\n      and discretion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We left the park and took the way to the Donjon Inn.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you often eat here?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut you also take your meals at the chateau?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Larsan and I are sometimes served in one of our rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHasn\u2019t Monsieur Stangerson ever invited you to his own table?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoes your presence at the chateau displease him?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know; but, in any case, he does not make us feel that we are in\r\n\r\n      his way.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoesn\u2019t he question you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever. He is in the same state of mind as he was in at the door of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room when his daughter was being murdered, and when he broke open\r\n\r\n      the door and did not find the murderer. He is persuaded, since he could\r\n\r\n      discover nothing, that there\u2019s no reason why we should be able to discover\r\n\r\n      more than he did. But he has made it his duty, since Larsan expressed his\r\n\r\n      theory, not to oppose us.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille buried himself in thought again for some time. He aroused\r\n\r\n      himself later to tell me of how he came to set the two concierges free.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI went recently to see Monsieur Stangerson, and took with me a piece of\r\n\r\n      paper on which was written: \u2018I promise, whatever others may say, to keep\r\n\r\n      in my service my two faithful servants, Bernier and his wife.\u2019 I explained\r\n\r\n      to him that, by signing that document, he would enable me to compel those\r\n\r\n      two people to speak out; and I declared my own assurance of their\r\n\r\n      innocence of any part in the crime. That was also his opinion. The\r\n\r\n      examining magistrate, after it was signed, presented the document to the\r\n\r\n      Berniers, who then did speak. They said, what I was certain they would\r\n\r\n      say, as soon as they were sure they would not lose their place.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey confessed to poaching on Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s estates, and it was\r\n\r\n      while they were poaching, on the night of the crime, that they were found\r\n\r\n      not far from the pavilion at the moment when the outrage was being\r\n\r\n      committed. Some rabbits they caught in that way were sold by them to the\r\n\r\n      landlord of the Donjon Inn, who served them to his customers, or sent them\r\n\r\n      to Paris. That was the truth, as I had guessed from the first. Do you\r\n\r\n      remember what I said, on entering the Donjon Inn?\u2014\u2018We shall have to\r\n\r\n      eat red meat\u2014now!\u2019 I had heard the words on the same morning when we\r\n\r\n      arrived at the park gate. You heard them also, but you did not attach any\r\n\r\n      importance to them. You recollect, when we reached the park gate, that we\r\n\r\n      stopped to look at a man who was running by the side of the wall, looking\r\n\r\n      every minute at his watch. That was Larsan. Well, behind us the landlord\r\n\r\n      of the Donjon Inn, standing on his doorstep, said to someone inside: \u2018We\r\n\r\n      shall have to eat red meat\u2014now.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy that \u2018now\u2019? When you are, as I am, in search of some hidden secret,\r\n\r\n      you can\u2019t afford to have anything escape you. You\u2019ve got to know the\r\n\r\n      meaning of everything. We had come into a rather out-of-the-way part of\r\n\r\n      the country which had been turned topsy-turvey by a crime, and my reason\r\n\r\n      led me to suspect every phrase that could bear upon the event of the day.\r\n\r\n      \u2018Now,\u2019 I took to mean, \u2018since the outrage.\u2019 In the course of my inquiry,\r\n\r\n      therefore, I sought to find a relation between that phrase and the\r\n\r\n      tragedy. We went to the Donjon Inn for breakfast; I repeated the phrase\r\n\r\n      and saw, by the surprise and trouble on Daddy Mathieu\u2019s face, that I had\r\n\r\n      not exaggerated its importance, so far as he was concerned.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI had just learned that the concierges had been arrested. Daddy Mathieu\r\n\r\n      spoke of them as of dear friends\u2014people for whom one is sorry. That\r\n\r\n      was a reckless conjunction of ideas, I said to myself. \u2018Now,\u2019 that the\r\n\r\n      concierges are arrested, \u2018we shall have to eat red meat.\u2019 No more\r\n\r\n      concierges, no more game! The hatred expressed by Daddy Mathieu for\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s forest-keeper\u2014a hatred he pretended was shared\r\n\r\n      by the concierges led me easily to think of poaching. Now as all the\r\n\r\n      evidence showed the concierges had not been in bed at the time of the\r\n\r\n      tragedy, why were they abroad that night? As participants in the crime? I\r\n\r\n      was not disposed to think so. I had already arrived at the conclusion, by\r\n\r\n      steps of which I will tell you later\u2014that the assassin had had no\r\n\r\n      accomplice, and that the tragedy held a mystery between Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and the murderer, a mystery with which the concierges had\r\n\r\n      nothing to do.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWith that theory in my mind, I searched for proof in their lodge, which,\r\n\r\n      as you know, I entered. I found there under their bed, some springs and\r\n\r\n      brass wire. \u2018Ah!\u2019 I thought, \u2018these things explain why they were out in\r\n\r\n      the park at night!\u2019 I was not surprised at the dogged silence they\r\n\r\n      maintained before the examining magistrate, even under the accusation so\r\n\r\n      grave as that of being accomplices in the crime. Poaching would save them\r\n\r\n      from the Assize Court, but it would lose them their places; and, as they\r\n\r\n      were perfectly sure of their innocence of the crime they hoped it would\r\n\r\n      soon be established, and then their poaching might go on as usual. They\r\n\r\n      could always confess later. I, however, hastened their confession by means\r\n\r\n      of the document Monsieur Stangerson signed. They gave all the necessary\r\n\r\n      \u2018proofs,\u2019 were set at liberty, and have now a lively gratitude for me. Why\r\n\r\n      did I not get them released sooner? Because I was not sure that nothing\r\n\r\n      more than poaching was against them. I wanted to study the ground. As the\r\n\r\n      days went by, my conviction became more and more certain. The day after\r\n\r\n      the events of the inexplicable gallery I had need of help I could rely on,\r\n\r\n      so I resolved to have them released at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      That was how Joseph Rouletabille explained himself. Once more I could not\r\n\r\n      but be astonished at the simplicity of the reasoning which had brought him\r\n\r\n      to the truth of the matter. Certainly this was no big thing; but I think,\r\n\r\n      myself, that the young man will, one of these days, explain with the same\r\n\r\n      simplicity, the fearful tragedy in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d as well as the\r\n\r\n      phenomenon of the inexplicable gallery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We reached the Donjon Inn and entered it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      This time we did not see the landlord, but were received with a pleasant\r\n\r\n      smile by the hostess. I have already described the room in which we found\r\n\r\n      ourselves, and I have given a glimpse of the charming blonde woman with\r\n\r\n      the gentle eyes who now immediately began to prepare our breakfast.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow\u2019s Daddy Mathieu?\u201d asked Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot much better\u2014not much better; he is still confined to his bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHis rheumatism still sticks to him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes. Last night I was again obliged to give him morphine\u2014the only\r\n\r\n      drug that gives him any relief.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      She spoke in a soft voice. Everything about her expressed gentleness. She\r\n\r\n      was, indeed, a beautiful woman; somewhat with an air of indolence, with\r\n\r\n      great eyes seemingly black and blue\u2014amorous eyes. Was she happy with\r\n\r\n      her crabbed, rheumatic husband? The scene at which we had once been\r\n\r\n      present did not lead us to believe that she was; yet there was something\r\n\r\n      in her bearing that was not suggestive of despair. She disappeared into\r\n\r\n      the kitchen to prepare our repast, leaving on the table a bottle of\r\n\r\n      excellent cider. Rouletabille filled our earthenware mugs, loaded his\r\n\r\n      pipe, and quietly explained to me his reason for asking me to come to the\r\n\r\n      Glandier with revolvers.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes,\u201d he said, contemplatively looking at the clouds of smoke he was\r\n\r\n      puffing out, \u201cyes, my dear boy, I expect the assassin to-night.\u201d A brief\r\n\r\n      silence followed, which I took care not to interrupt, and then he went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cLast night, just as I was going to bed, Monsieur Robert Darzac knocked at\r\n\r\n      my room. When he came in he confided to me that he was compelled to go to\r\n\r\n      Paris the next day, that is, this morning. The reason which made this\r\n\r\n      journey necessary was at once peremptory and mysterious; it was not\r\n\r\n      possible for him to explain its object to me. \u2018I go, and yet,\u2019 he added,\r\n\r\n      \u2018I would give my life not to leave Mademoiselle Stangerson at this\r\n\r\n      moment.\u2019 He did not try to hide that he believed her to be once more in\r\n\r\n      danger. \u2018It will not greatly astonish me if something happens to-morrow\r\n\r\n      night,\u2019 he avowed, \u2018and yet I must be absent. I cannot be back at the\r\n\r\n      Glandier before the morning of the day after to-morrow.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI asked him to explain himself, and this is all he would tell me. His\r\n\r\n      anticipation of coming danger had come to him solely from the coincidence\r\n\r\n      that Mademoiselle Stangerson had been twice attacked, and both times when\r\n\r\n      he had been absent. On the night of the incident of the inexplicable\r\n\r\n      gallery he had been obliged to be away from the Glandier. On the night of\r\n\r\n      the tragedy in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d he had also not been able to be at the\r\n\r\n      Glandier, though this was the first time he had declared himself on the\r\n\r\n      matter. Now a man so moved who would still go away must be acting under\r\n\r\n      compulsion\u2014must be obeying a will stronger than his own. That was\r\n\r\n      how I reasoned, and I told him so. He replied \u2018Perhaps.\u2019\u2014I asked him\r\n\r\n      if Mademoiselle Stangerson was compelling him. He protested that she was\r\n\r\n      not. His determination to go to Paris had been taken without any\r\n\r\n      conference with Mademoiselle Stangerson.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo cut the story short, he repeated that his belief in the possibility of\r\n\r\n      a fresh attack was founded entirely on the extraordinary coincidence. \u2018If\r\n\r\n      anything happens to Mademoiselle Stangerson,\u2019 he said, \u2018it would be\r\n\r\n      terrible for both of us. For her, because her life would be in danger; for\r\n\r\n      me because I could neither defend her from the attack nor tell of where I\r\n\r\n      had been. I am perfectly aware of the suspicions cast on me. The examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate and Monsieur Larsan are both on the point of believing in my\r\n\r\n      guilt. Larsan tracked me the last time I went to Paris, and I had all the\r\n\r\n      trouble in the world to get rid of him.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Why do you not tell me the name of the murderer now, if you know it?\u2019 I\r\n\r\n      cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac appeared extremely troubled by my question, and replied\r\n\r\n      to me in a hesitating tone:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I?\u2014I know the name of the murderer? Why, how could I know his\r\n\r\n      name?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI at once replied: \u2018From Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe grew so pale that I thought he was about to faint, and I saw that I\r\n\r\n      had hit the nail right on the head. Mademoiselle and he knew the name of\r\n\r\n      the murderer! When he recovered himself, he said to me: \u2018I am going to\r\n\r\n      leave you. Since you have been here I have appreciated your exceptional\r\n\r\n      intelligence and your unequalled ingenuity. But I ask this service of you.\r\n\r\n      Perhaps I am wrong to fear an attack during the coming night; but, as I\r\n\r\n      must act with foresight, I count on you to frustrate any attempt that may\r\n\r\n      be made. Take every step needful to protect Mademoiselle Stangerson. Keep\r\n\r\n      a most careful watch of her room. Don\u2019t go to sleep, nor allow yourself\r\n\r\n      one moment of repose. The man we dread is remarkably cunning\u2014with a\r\n\r\n      cunning that has never been equalled. If you keep watch his very cunning\r\n\r\n      may save her; because it\u2019s impossible that he should not know that you are\r\n\r\n      watching; and knowing it, he may not venture.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Have you spoken of all this to Monsieur Stangerson?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No. I do not wish him to ask me, as you just now did, for the name of\r\n\r\n      the murderer. I tell you all this, Monsieur Rouletabille, because I have\r\n\r\n      great, very great, confidence in you. I know that you do not suspect me.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe poor man spoke in jerks. He was evidently suffering. I pitied him,\r\n\r\n      the more because I felt sure that he would rather allow himself to be\r\n\r\n      killed than tell me who the murderer was. As for Mademoiselle Stangerson,\r\n\r\n      I felt that she would rather allow herself to be murdered than denounce\r\n\r\n      the man of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and of the inexplicable gallery. The man must\r\n\r\n      be dominating her, or both, by some inscrutable power. They were dreading\r\n\r\n      nothing so much as the chance of Monsieur Stangerson knowing that his\r\n\r\n      daughter was \u2018held\u2019 by her assailant. I made Monsieur Darzac understand\r\n\r\n      that he had explained himself sufficiently, and that he might refrain from\r\n\r\n      telling me any more than he had already told me. I promised him to watch\r\n\r\n      through the night. He insisted that I should establish an absolutely\r\n\r\n      impassable barrier around Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber, around the\r\n\r\n      boudoir where the nurses were sleeping, and around the drawing-room where,\r\n\r\n      since the affair of the inexplicable gallery, Monsieur Stangerson had\r\n\r\n      slept. In short, I was to put a cordon round the whole apartment.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrom his insistence I gathered that Monsieur Darzac intended not only to\r\n\r\n      make it impossible for the expected man to reach the chamber of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, but to make that impossibility so visibly clear\r\n\r\n      that, seeing himself expected, he would at once go away. That was how I\r\n\r\n      interpreted his final words when we parted: \u2018You may mention your\r\n\r\n      suspicions of the expected attack to Monsieur Stangerson, to Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques, to Frederic Larsan, and to anybody in the chateau.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe poor fellow left me hardly knowing what he was saying. My silence and\r\n\r\n      my eyes told him that I had guessed a large part of his secret. And,\r\n\r\n      indeed, he must have been at his wits\u2019 end, to have come to me at such a\r\n\r\n      time, and to abandon Mademoiselle Stangerson in spite of his fixed idea as\r\n\r\n      to the consequence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen he was gone, I began to think that I should have to use even a\r\n\r\n      greater cunning than his so that if the man should come that night, he\r\n\r\n      might not for a moment suspect that his coming had been expected.\r\n\r\n      Certainly! I would allow him to get in far enough, so that, dead or alive,\r\n\r\n      I might see his face clearly! He must be got rid of. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson must be freed from this continual impending danger.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, my boy,\u201d said Rouletabille, after placing his pipe on the table, and\r\n\r\n      emptying his mug of cider, \u201cI must see his face distinctly, so as to make\r\n\r\n      sure to impress it on that part of my brain where I have drawn my circle\r\n\r\n      of reasoning.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The landlady re-appeared at that moment, bringing in the traditional bacon\r\n\r\n      omelette. Rouletabille chaffed her a little, and she took the chaff with\r\n\r\n      the most charming good humour.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is much jollier when Daddy Mathieu is in bed with his rheumatism,\u201d\r\n\r\n       Rouletabille said to me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But I had eyes neither for Rouletabille nor for the landlady\u2019s smiles. I\r\n\r\n      was entirely absorbed over the last words of my young friend and in\r\n\r\n      thinking over Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s strange behaviour.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When he had finished his omelette and we were again alone, Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      continued the tale of his confidences.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I sent you my telegram this morning,\u201d he said, \u201cI had only the word\r\n\r\n      of Monsieur Darzac, that \u2018perhaps\u2019 the assassin would come to-night. I can\r\n\r\n      now say that he will certainly come. I expect him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat has made you feel this certainty?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have been sure since half-past ten o\u2019clock this morning that he would\r\n\r\n      come. I knew that before we saw Arthur Rance at the window in the court.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d I said, \u201cBut, again\u2014what made you so sure? And why since\r\n\r\n      half-past ten this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause, at half-past ten, I had proof that Mademoiselle Stangerson was\r\n\r\n      making as many efforts to permit of the murderer\u2019s entrance as Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac had taken precautions against it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs that possible!\u201d I cried. \u201cHaven\u2019t you told me that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson loves Monsieur Robert Darzac?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI told you so because it is the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen do you see nothing strange\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything in this business is strange, my friend; but take my word for\r\n\r\n      it, the strangeness you now feel is nothing to the strangeness that\u2019s to\r\n\r\n      come!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt must be admitted, then,\u201d I said, \u201cthat Mademoiselle Stangerson and her\r\n\r\n      murderer are in communication\u2014at any rate in writing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAdmit it, my friend, admit it! You don\u2019t risk anything! I told you about\r\n\r\n      the letter left on her table, on the night of the inexplicable gallery\r\n\r\n      affair,\u2014the letter that disappeared into the pocket of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. Why should it not have been a summons to a meeting? Might he\r\n\r\n      not, as soon as he was sure of Darzac\u2019s absence, appoint the meeting for\r\n\r\n      \u2018the coming night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And my friend laughed silently. There are moments when I ask myself if he\r\n\r\n      is not laughing at me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The door of the inn opened. Rouletabille was on his feet so suddenly that\r\n\r\n      one might have thought he had received an electric shock.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMr. Arthur Rance!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mr. Arthur Rance stood before us calmly bowing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XX. An Act of Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou remember me, Monsieur?\u201d asked Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerfectly!\u201d replied Arthur Rance. \u201cI recognise you as the lad at the bar.\r\n\r\n      [The face of Rouletabille crimsoned at being called a \u201clad.\u201d] I want to\r\n\r\n      shake hands with you. You are a bright little fellow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The American extended his hand and Rouletabille, relaxing his frown, shook\r\n\r\n      it and introduced Mr. Arthur Rance to me. He invited him to share our\r\n\r\n      meal.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo thanks. I breakfasted with Monsieur Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Arthur Rance spoke French perfectly,\u2014almost without an accent.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not expect to have the pleasure of seeing you again, Monsieur. I\r\n\r\n      thought you were to have left France the day after the reception at the\r\n\r\n      Elysee.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and I, outwardly indifferent, listened most intently for\r\n\r\n      every word the American would say.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The man\u2019s purplish red face, his heavy eyelids, the nervous twitchings,\r\n\r\n      all spoke of his addiction to drink. How came it that so sorry a specimen\r\n\r\n      of a man should be so intimate with Monsieur Stangerson?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Some days later, I learned from Frederic Larsan\u2014who, like ourselves,\r\n\r\n      was surprised and mystified by his appearance and reception at the chateau\u2014that\r\n\r\n      Mr. Rance had been an inebriate for only about fifteen years; that is to\r\n\r\n      say, since the professor and his daughter left Philadelphia. During the\r\n\r\n      time the Stangersons lived in America they were very intimate with Arthur\r\n\r\n      Rance, who was one of the most distinguished phrenologists of the new\r\n\r\n      world. Owing to new experiments, he had made enormous strides beyond the\r\n\r\n      science of Gall and Lavater. The friendliness with which he was received\r\n\r\n      at the Glandier may be explained by the fact that he had once rendered\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson a great service by stopping, at the peril of his\r\n\r\n      own life, the runaway horses of her carriage. The immediate result of that\r\n\r\n      could, however, have been no more than a mere friendly association with\r\n\r\n      the Stangersons; certainly, not a love affair.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan did not tell me where he had picked up this information;\r\n\r\n      but he appeared to be quite sure of what he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Had we known these facts at the time Arthur Rance met us at the Donjon\r\n\r\n      Inn, his presence at the chateau might not have puzzled us, but they could\r\n\r\n      not have failed to increase our interest in the man himself. The American\r\n\r\n      must have been at least forty-five years old. He spoke in a perfectly\r\n\r\n      natural tone in reply to Rouletabille\u2019s question.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI put off my return to America when I heard of the attack on Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. I wanted to be certain the lady had not been killed, and I\r\n\r\n      shall not go away until she is perfectly recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Arthur Rance then took the lead in talk, paying no heed to some of\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s questions. He gave us, without our inviting him, his\r\n\r\n      personal views on the subject of the tragedy,\u2014views which, as well\r\n\r\n      as I could make out, were not far from those held by Frederic Larzan. The\r\n\r\n      American also thought that Robert Darzac had something to do with the\r\n\r\n      matter. He did not mention him by name, but there was no room to doubt\r\n\r\n      whom he meant. He told us he was aware of the efforts young Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      was making to unravel the tangled skein of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d mystery. He\r\n\r\n      explained that Monsieur Stangerson had related to him all that had taken\r\n\r\n      place in the inexplicable gallery. He several times expressed his regret\r\n\r\n      at Monsieur Darzac\u2019s absence from the chateau on all these occasions, and\r\n\r\n      thought that Monsieur Darzac had done cleverly in allying himself with\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille, who could not fail, sooner or later, to\r\n\r\n      discover the murderer. He spoke the last sentence with unconcealed irony.\r\n\r\n      Then he rose, bowed to us, and left the inn.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille watched him through the window.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn odd fish, that!\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll pass the night at the Glandier?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      To my amazement the young reporter answered that it was a matter of entire\r\n\r\n      indifference to him whether he did or not.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As to how we spent our time during the afternoon, all I need say is that\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille led me to the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve, and, all the time,\r\n\r\n      talked of every subject but the one in which we were most interested.\r\n\r\n      Towards evening I was surprised to find Rouletabille making none of the\r\n\r\n      preparations I had expected him to make. I spoke to him about it when\r\n\r\n      night had come on, and we were once more in his room. He replied that all\r\n\r\n      his arrangements had already been made, and this time the murderer would\r\n\r\n      not get away from him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I expressed some doubt on this, reminding him of his disappearance in the\r\n\r\n      gallery, and suggested that the same phenomenon might occur again. He\r\n\r\n      answered that he hoped it would. He desired nothing more. I did not\r\n\r\n      insist, knowing by experience how useless that would have been. He told me\r\n\r\n      that, with the help of the concierges, the chateau had since early dawn\r\n\r\n      been watched in such a way that nobody could approach it without his\r\n\r\n      knowing it, and that he had no concern for those who might have left it\r\n\r\n      and remained without.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was then six o\u2019clock by his watch. Rising, he made a sign to me to\r\n\r\n      follow him, and, without in the least trying to conceal his movements or\r\n\r\n      the sound of his footsteps, he led me through the gallery. We reached the\r\n\r\n      \u2018right\u2019 gallery and came to the landing-place which we crossed. We then\r\n\r\n      continued our way in the gallery of the left wing, passing Professor\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s apartment.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At the far end of the gallery, before coming to the donjon, is the room\r\n\r\n      occupied by Arthur Rance. We knew that, because we had seen him at the\r\n\r\n      window looking on to the court. The door of the room opens on to the end\r\n\r\n      of the gallery, exactly facing the east window, at the extremity of the\r\n\r\n      \u2018right\u2019 gallery, where Rouletabille had placed Daddy Jacques, and commands\r\n\r\n      an uninterrupted view of the gallery from end to end of the chateau.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cI reserve for myself;\r\n\r\n      when I tell you you\u2019ll come and take your place here.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he made me enter a little dark, triangular closet built in a bend of\r\n\r\n      the wall, to the left of the door of Arthur Rance\u2019s room. From this recess\r\n\r\n      I could see all that occurred in the gallery as well as if I had been\r\n\r\n      standing in front of Arthur Rance\u2019s door, and I could watch that door,\r\n\r\n      too. The door of the closet, which was to be my place of observation, was\r\n\r\n      fitted with panels of transparent glass. In the gallery, where all the\r\n\r\n      lamps had been lit, it was quite light. In the closet, however, it was\r\n\r\n      quite dark. It was a splendid place from which to observe and remain\r\n\r\n      unobserved.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was soon to play the part of a spy\u2014a common policeman. I wonder\r\n\r\n      what my leader at the bar would have said had he known! I was not\r\n\r\n      altogether pleased with my duties, but I could not refuse Rouletabille the\r\n\r\n      assistance he had begged me to give him. I took care not to make him see\r\n\r\n      that I in the least objected, and for several reasons. I wanted to oblige\r\n\r\n      him; I did not wish him to think me a coward; I was filled with curiosity;\r\n\r\n      and it was too late for me to draw back, even had I determined to do so.\r\n\r\n      That I had not had these scruples sooner was because my curiosity had\r\n\r\n      quite got the better of me. I might also urge that I was helping to save\r\n\r\n      the life of a woman, and even a lawyer may do that conscientiously.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We returned along the gallery. On reaching the door of Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s apartment, it opened from a push given by the steward who was\r\n\r\n      waiting at the dinner-table. (Monsieur Stangerson had, for the last three\r\n\r\n      days, dined with his daughter in the drawing-room on the first floor.) As\r\n\r\n      the door remained open, we distinctly saw Mademoiselle Stangerson, taking\r\n\r\n      advantage of the steward\u2019s absence, and while her father was stooping to\r\n\r\n      pick up something he had let fall, pour the contents of a phial into\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson\u2019s glass.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXI. On the Watch\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The act, which staggered me, did not appear to affect Rouletabille much.\r\n\r\n      We returned to his room and, without even referring to what we had seen,\r\n\r\n      he gave me his final instructions for the night. First we were to go to\r\n\r\n      dinner; after dinner, I was to take my stand in the dark closet and wait\r\n\r\n      there as long as it was necessary\u2014to look out for what might happen.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf you see anything before I do,\u201d he explained, \u201cyou must let me know. If\r\n\r\n      the man gets into the \u2018right\u2019 gallery by any other way than the\r\n\r\n      \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, you will see him before I shall, because you have a\r\n\r\n      view along the whole length of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery, while I can only\r\n\r\n      command a view of the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery. All you need do to let me\r\n\r\n      know is to undo the cord holding the curtain of the \u2018right\u2019 gallery\r\n\r\n      window, nearest to the dark closet. The curtain will fall of itself and\r\n\r\n      immediately leave a square of shadow where previously there had been a\r\n\r\n      square of light. To do this, you need but stretch your hand out of the\r\n\r\n      closet, I shall understand your signal perfectly.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you will see me coming round the corner of the \u2018off-turning\u2019\r\n\r\n      gallery.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat am I to do then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will immediately come towards me, behind the man; but I shall already\r\n\r\n      be upon him, and shall have seen his face.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I attempted a feeble smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy do you smile? Well, you may smile while you have the chance, but I\r\n\r\n      swear you\u2019ll have no time for that a few hours from now.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd if the man escapes?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said Rouletabille, coolly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to capture\r\n\r\n      him. He may take himself off any way he can. I will let him go\u2014after\r\n\r\n      I have seen his face. That\u2019s all I want. I shall know afterwards what to\r\n\r\n      do so that as far as Mademoiselle Stangerson is concerned he shall be dead\r\n\r\n      to her even though he continues to live. If I took him alive, Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson and Robert Darzac would, perhaps, never forgive me! And I wish\r\n\r\n      to retain their good-will and respect.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSeeing, as I have just now seen, Mademoiselle Stangerson pour a narcotic\r\n\r\n      into her father\u2019s glass, so that he might not be awake to interrupt the\r\n\r\n      conversation she is going to have with her murderer, you can imagine she\r\n\r\n      would not be grateful to me if I brought the man of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and\r\n\r\n      the inexplicable gallery, bound and gagged, to her father. I realise now\r\n\r\n      that if I am to save the unhappy lady, I must silence the man and not\r\n\r\n      capture him. To kill a human being is no small thing. Besides, that\u2019s not\r\n\r\n      my business, unless the man himself makes it my business. On the other\r\n\r\n      hand, to render him forever silent without the lady\u2019s assent and\r\n\r\n      confidence is to act on one\u2019s own initiative and assumes a knowledge of\r\n\r\n      everything with nothing for a basis. Fortunately, my friend, I have\r\n\r\n      guessed, no, I have reasoned it all out. All that I ask of the man who is\r\n\r\n      coming to-night is to bring me his face, so that it may enter\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cInto the circle?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly! And his face won\u2019t surprise me!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I thought you saw his face on the night when you sprang into the\r\n\r\n      chamber?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOnly imperfectly. The candle was on the floor; and, his beard\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWill he wear his beard this evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think I can say for certain that he will. But the gallery is light and,\r\n\r\n      now, I know\u2014or\u2014at least, my brain knows\u2014and my eyes will\r\n\r\n      see.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we are here only to see him and let him escape, why are we armed?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause, if the man of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d and the inexplicable gallery knows\r\n\r\n      that I know, he is capable of doing anything! We should then have to\r\n\r\n      defend ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you are sure he will come to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs sure as that you are standing there! This morning, at half-past ten\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock, Mademoiselle Stangerson, in the cleverest way in the world,\r\n\r\n      arranged to have no nurses to-night. She gave them leave of absence for\r\n\r\n      twenty-four hours, under some plausible pretexts, and did not desire\r\n\r\n      anybody to be with her but her father, while they are away. Her father,\r\n\r\n      who is to sleep in the boudoir, has gladly consented to the arrangement.\r\n\r\n      Darzac\u2019s departure and what he told me, as well as the extraordinary\r\n\r\n      precautions Mademoiselle Stangerson is taking to be alone to-night leaves\r\n\r\n      me no room for doubt. She has prepared the way for the coming of the man\r\n\r\n      whom Darzac dreads.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat\u2019s awful!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what we saw her do was done to send her father to sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen there are but two of us for to-night\u2019s work?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFour; the concierge and his wife will watch at all hazards. I don\u2019t set\r\n\r\n      much value on them before\u2014but the concierge may be useful after\u2014if\r\n\r\n      there\u2019s to be any killing!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you think there may be?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf he wishes it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you brought in Daddy Jacques?\u2014Have you made no use of\r\n\r\n      him to-day?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo,\u201d replied Rouletabille sharply.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I kept silence for awhile, then, anxious to know his thoughts, I asked him\r\n\r\n      point blank:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy not tell Arthur Rance?\u2014He may be of great assistance to us?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh!\u201d said Rouletabille crossly, \u201cthen you want to let everybody into\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s secrets?\u2014Come, let us go to dinner; it is\r\n\r\n      time. This evening we dine in Frederic Larsan\u2019s room,\u2014at least, if\r\n\r\n      he is not on the heels of Darzac. He sticks to him like a leech. But,\r\n\r\n      anyhow, if he is not there now, I am quite sure he will be, to-night! He\u2019s\r\n\r\n      the one I am going to knock over!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At this moment we heard a noise in the room near us.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt must be he,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI forgot to ask you,\u201d I said, \u201cif we are to make any allusion to\r\n\r\n      to-night\u2019s business when we are with this policeman. I take it we are not.\r\n\r\n      Is that so?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently. We are going to operate alone, on our own personal account.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo that all the glory will be ours?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille laughed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We dined with Frederic Larsan in his room. He told us he had just come in\r\n\r\n      and invited us to be seated at table. We ate our dinner in the best of\r\n\r\n      humours, and I had no difficulty in appreciating the feelings of certainty\r\n\r\n      which both Rouletabille and Larsan felt. Rouletabille told the great Fred\r\n\r\n      that I had come on a chance visit, and that he had asked me to stay and\r\n\r\n      help him in the heavy batch of writing he had to get through for the\r\n\r\n      \u201cEpoque.\u201d I was going back to Paris, he said, by the eleven o\u2019clock train,\r\n\r\n      taking his \u201ccopy,\u201d which took a story form, recounting the principal\r\n\r\n      episodes in the mysteries of the Glandier. Larsan smiled at the\r\n\r\n      explanation like a man who was not fooled and politely refrains from\r\n\r\n      making the slightest remark on matters which did not concern him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With infinite precautions as to the words they used, and even as to the\r\n\r\n      tones of their voices, Larsan and Rouletabille discussed, for a long time,\r\n\r\n      Mr. Arthur Rance\u2019s appearance at the chateau, and his past in America,\r\n\r\n      about which they expressed a desire to know more, at any rate, so far as\r\n\r\n      his relations with the Stangersons. At one time, Larsan, who appeared to\r\n\r\n      me to be unwell, said, with an effort:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think, Monsieur Rouletabille, that we\u2019ve not much more to do at the\r\n\r\n      Glandier, and that we sha\u2019n\u2019t sleep here many more nights.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think so, too, Monsieur Fred.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you think the conclusion of the matter has been reached?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI think, indeed, that we have nothing more to find out,\u201d replied\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you found your criminal?\u201d asked Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo have I,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan it be the same man?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have swerved from your original idea,\u201d said the young\r\n\r\n      reporter. Then he added, with emphasis: \u201cMonsieur Darzac is an honest\r\n\r\n      man!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you sure of that?\u201d asked Larsan. \u201cWell, I am sure he is not. So it\u2019s\r\n\r\n      a fight then?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, it is a fight. But I shall beat you, Monsieur Frederic Larsan.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYouth never doubts anything,\u201d said the great Fred laughingly, and held\r\n\r\n      out his hand to me by way of conclusion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s answer came like an echo:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot anything!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Suddenly Larsan, who had risen to wish us goodnight, pressed both his\r\n\r\n      hands to his chest and staggered. He was obliged to lean on Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      for support, and to save himself from falling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! Oh!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat is the matter with me?\u2014Have I been\r\n\r\n      poisoned?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He looked at us with haggard eyes. We questioned him vainly; he did not\r\n\r\n      answer us. He had sunk into an armchair and we could get not a word from\r\n\r\n      him. We were extremely distressed, both on his account and on our own, for\r\n\r\n      we had partaken of all the dishes he had eaten. He seemed to be out of\r\n\r\n      pain; but his heavy head had fallen on his shoulder and his eyelids were\r\n\r\n      tightly closed. Rouletabille bent over him, listening for the beatings of\r\n\r\n      the heart.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend\u2019s face, however, when he stood up, was as calm as it had been a\r\n\r\n      moment before agitated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is asleep,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He led me to his chamber, after closing Larsan\u2019s room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe drug?\u201d I asked. \u201cDoes Mademoiselle Stangerson wish to put everybody\r\n\r\n      to sleep, to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps,\u201d replied Rouletabille; but I could see he was thinking of\r\n\r\n      something else.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what about us?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow do we know that we have not been\r\n\r\n      drugged?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you feel indisposed?\u201d Rouletabille asked me coolly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you feel any inclination to go to sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone whatever.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, then, my friend, smoke this excellent cigar.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he handed me a choice Havana, one Monsieur Darzac had given him, while\r\n\r\n      he lit his briarwood\u2014his eternal briarwood.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We remained in his room until about ten o\u2019clock without a word passing\r\n\r\n      between us. Buried in an armchair Rouletabille sat and smoked steadily,\r\n\r\n      his brow in thought and a far-away look in his eyes. On the stroke of ten\r\n\r\n      he took off his boots and signalled to me to do the same. As we stood in\r\n\r\n      our socks he said, in so low a tone that I guessed, rather than heard, the\r\n\r\n      word:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRevolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I drew my revolver from my jacket pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCock it!\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I did as he directed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Then moving towards the door of his room, he opened it with infinite\r\n\r\n      precaution; it made no sound. We were in the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille made another sign to me which I understood to mean that I was\r\n\r\n      to take up my post in the dark closet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When I was some distance from him, he rejoined me and embraced me; and\r\n\r\n      then I saw him, with the same precaution, return to his room. Astonished\r\n\r\n      by his embrace, and somewhat disquieted by it, I arrived at the right\r\n\r\n      gallery without difficulty, crossing the landing-place, and reaching the\r\n\r\n      dark closet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Before entering it I examined the curtain-cord of the window and found\r\n\r\n      that I had only to release it from its fastening with my fingers for the\r\n\r\n      curtain to fall by its own weight and hide the square of light from\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2014the signal agreed upon. The sound of a footstep made me\r\n\r\n      halt before Arthur Rance\u2019s door. He was not yet in bed, then! How was it\r\n\r\n      that, being in the chateau, he had not dined with Monsieur Stangerson and\r\n\r\n      his daughter? I had not seen him at table with them, at the moment when we\r\n\r\n      looked in.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I retired into the dark closet. I found myself perfectly situated. I could\r\n\r\n      see along the whole length of the gallery. Nothing, absolutely nothing\r\n\r\n      could pass there without my seeing it. But what was going to pass there?\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s embrace came back to my mind. I argued that people don\u2019t\r\n\r\n      part from each, other in that way unless on an important or dangerous\r\n\r\n      occasion. Was I then in danger?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My hand closed on the butt of my revolver and I waited. I am not a hero;\r\n\r\n      but neither am I a coward.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I waited about an hour, and during all that time I saw nothing unusual.\r\n\r\n      The rain, which had begun to come down strongly towards nine o\u2019clock, had\r\n\r\n      now ceased.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      My friend had told me that, probably, nothing would occur before midnight\r\n\r\n      or one o\u2019clock in the morning. It was not more than half-past eleven,\r\n\r\n      however, when I heard the door of Arthur Rance\u2019s room open very slowly.\r\n\r\n      The door remained open for a minute, which seemed to me a long time. As it\r\n\r\n      opened into the gallery, that is to say, outwards, I could not see what\r\n\r\n      was passing in the room behind the door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment I noticed a strange sound, three times repeated, coming\r\n\r\n      from the park. Ordinarily I should not have attached any more importance\r\n\r\n      to it than I would to the noise of cats on the roof. But the third time,\r\n\r\n      the mew was so sharp and penetrating that I remembered what I had heard\r\n\r\n      about the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu. As the cry had accompanied all the\r\n\r\n      events at the Glandier, I could not refrain from shuddering at the\r\n\r\n      thought.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Directly afterwards I saw a man appear on the outside of the door, and\r\n\r\n      close it after him. At first I could not recognise him, for his back was\r\n\r\n      towards me and he was bending over a rather bulky package. When he had\r\n\r\n      closed the door and picked up the package, he turned towards the dark\r\n\r\n      closet, and then I saw who he was. He was the forest-keeper, the Green\r\n\r\n      Man. He was wearing the same costume that he had worn when I first saw him\r\n\r\n      on the road in front of the Donjon Inn. There was no doubt about his being\r\n\r\n      the keeper. As the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu came for the third time, he\r\n\r\n      put down the package and went to the second window, counting from the dark\r\n\r\n      closet. I dared not risk making any movement, fearing I might betray my\r\n\r\n      presence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Arriving at the window, he peered out on to the park. The night was now\r\n\r\n      light, the moon showing at intervals. The Green Man raised his arms twice,\r\n\r\n      making signs which I did not understand; then, leaving the window, he\r\n\r\n      again took up his package and moved along the gallery towards the\r\n\r\n      landing-place.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had instructed me to undo the curtain-cord when I saw\r\n\r\n      anything. Was Rouletabille expecting this? It was not my business to\r\n\r\n      question. All I had to do was obey instructions. I unfastened the\r\n\r\n      window-cord; my heart beating the while as if it would burst. The man\r\n\r\n      reached the landing-place, but, to my utter surprise\u2014I had expected\r\n\r\n      to see him continue to pass along the gallery\u2014I saw him descend the\r\n\r\n      stairs leading to the vestibule.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      What was I to do? I looked stupidly at the heavy curtain which had shut\r\n\r\n      the light from the window. The signal had been given, and I did not see\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille appear at the corner of the off-turning gallery. Nobody\r\n\r\n      appeared. I was exceedingly perplexed. Half an hour passed, an age to me.\r\n\r\n      What was I to do now, even if I saw something? The signal once given I\r\n\r\n      could not give it a second time. To venture into the gallery might upset\r\n\r\n      all Rouletabille\u2019s plans. After all, I had nothing to reproach myself for,\r\n\r\n      and if something had happened that my friend had not expected he could\r\n\r\n      only blame himself. Unable to be of any further assistance to him by means\r\n\r\n      of a signal, I left the dark closet and, still in my socks, made my way to\r\n\r\n      the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      There was no one there. I went to the door of Rouletabille\u2019s room and\r\n\r\n      listened. I could hear nothing. I knocked gently. There was no answer. I\r\n\r\n      turned the door-handle and the door opened. I entered. Rouletabille lay\r\n\r\n      extended at full length on the floor.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXII. The Incredible Body\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I bent in great anxiety over the body of the reporter and had the joy to\r\n\r\n      find that he was deeply sleeping, the same unhealthy sleep that I had seen\r\n\r\n      fall upon Frederic Larsan. He had succumbed to the influence of the same\r\n\r\n      drug that had been mixed with our food. How was it then, that I, also, had\r\n\r\n      not been overcome by it? I reflected that the drug must have been put into\r\n\r\n      our wine; because that would explain my condition. I never drink when\r\n\r\n      eating. Naturally inclined to obesity, I am restricted to a dry diet. I\r\n\r\n      shook Rouletabille, but could not succeed in waking him. This, no doubt,\r\n\r\n      was the work of Mademoiselle Stangerson.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      She had certainly thought it necessary to guard herself against this young\r\n\r\n      man as well as her father. I recalled that the steward, in serving us, had\r\n\r\n      recommended an excellent Chablis which, no doubt, had come from the\r\n\r\n      professor\u2019s table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      More than a quarter of an hour passed. I resolved, under the pressing\r\n\r\n      circumstances, to resort to extreme measures. I threw a pitcher of cold\r\n\r\n      water over Rouletabille\u2019s head. He opened his eyes. I beat his face, and\r\n\r\n      raised him up. I felt him stiffen in my arms and heard him murmur: \u201cGo on,\r\n\r\n      go on; but don\u2019t make any noise.\u201d I pinched him and shook him until he was\r\n\r\n      able to stand up. We were saved!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey sent me to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAh! I passed an awful quarter of an\r\n\r\n      hour before giving way. But it is over now. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He had no sooner uttered those words than we were thrilled by a frightful\r\n\r\n      cry that rang through the chateau,\u2014a veritable death cry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMalheur!\u201d roared Rouletabille; \u201cwe shall be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He tried to rush to the door, but he was too dazed, and fell against the\r\n\r\n      wall. I was already in the gallery, revolver in hand, rushing like a\r\n\r\n      madman towards Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room. The moment I arrived at the\r\n\r\n      intersection of the \u201coff-turning\u201d gallery and the \u201cright\u201d gallery, I saw a\r\n\r\n      figure leaving her apartment, which, in a few strides had reached the\r\n\r\n      landing-place.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was not master of myself. I fired. The report from the revolver made a\r\n\r\n      deafening noise; but the man continued his flight down the stairs. I ran\r\n\r\n      behind him, shouting: \u201cStop!\u2014stop! or I will kill you!\u201d As I rushed\r\n\r\n      after him down the stairs, I came face to face with Arthur Rance coming\r\n\r\n      from the left wing of the chateau, yelling: \u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d We\r\n\r\n      arrived almost at the same time at the foot of the staircase. The window\r\n\r\n      of the vestibule was open. We distinctly saw the form of a man running\r\n\r\n      away. Instinctively we fired our revolvers in his direction. He was not\r\n\r\n      more than ten paces in front of us; he staggered and we thought he was\r\n\r\n      going to fall. We had sprung out of the window, but the man dashed off\r\n\r\n      with renewed vigour. I was in my socks, and the American was barefooted.\r\n\r\n      There being no hope of overtaking him, we fired our last cartridges at\r\n\r\n      him. But he still kept on running, going along the right side of the court\r\n\r\n      towards the end of the right wing of the chateau, which had no other\r\n\r\n      outlet than the door of the little chamber occupied by the forest-keeper.\r\n\r\n      The man, though he was evidently wounded by our bullets, was now twenty\r\n\r\n      yards ahead of us. Suddenly, behind us, and above our heads, a window in\r\n\r\n      the gallery opened and we heard the voice of Rouletabille crying out\r\n\r\n      desperately:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cFire, Bernier!\u2014Fire!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At that moment the clear moonlight night was further lit by a broad flash.\r\n\r\n      By its light we saw Daddy Bernier with his gun on the threshold of the\r\n\r\n      donjon door.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He had taken good aim. The shadow fell. But as it had reached the end of\r\n\r\n      the right wing of the chateau, it fell on the other side of the angle of\r\n\r\n      the building; that is to say, we saw it about to fall, but not the actual\r\n\r\n      sinking to the ground. Bernier, Arthur Rance and myself reached the other\r\n\r\n      side twenty seconds later. The shadow was lying dead at our feet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Aroused from his lethargy by the cries and reports, Larsan opened the\r\n\r\n      window of his chamber and called out to us. Rouletabille, quite awake now,\r\n\r\n      joined us at the same moment, and I cried out to him:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is dead!\u2014is dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo much the better,\u201d he said. \u201cTake him into the vestibule of the\r\n\r\n      chateau.\u201d Then as if on second thought, he said: \u201cNo!\u2014no! Let us put\r\n\r\n      him in his own room.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille knocked at the door. Nobody answered. Naturally, this did not\r\n\r\n      surprise me.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe is evidently not there, otherwise he would have come out,\u201d said the\r\n\r\n      reporter. \u201cLet us carry him to the vestibule then.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Since reaching the dead shadow, a thick cloud had covered the moon and\r\n\r\n      darkened the night, so that we were unable to make out the features. Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques, who had now joined us, helped us to carry the body into the\r\n\r\n      vestibule, where we laid it down on the lower step of the stairs. On the\r\n\r\n      way, I had felt my hands wet from the warm blood flowing from the wounds.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques flew to the kitchen and returned with a lantern. He held it\r\n\r\n      close to the face of the dead shadow, and we recognised the keeper, the\r\n\r\n      man called by the landlord of the Donjon Inn the Green Man, whom, an hour\r\n\r\n      earlier, I had seen come out of Arthur Rance\u2019s chamber carrying a parcel.\r\n\r\n      But what I had seen I could only tell Rouletabille later, when we were\r\n\r\n      alone.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and Frederic Larsan experienced a cruel disappointment at the\r\n\r\n      result of the night\u2019s adventure. They could only look in consternation and\r\n\r\n      stupefaction at the body of the Green Man.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques showed a stupidly sorrowful face and with silly lamentations\r\n\r\n      kept repeating that we were mistaken\u2014the keeper could not be the\r\n\r\n      assailant. We were obliged to compel him to be quiet. He could not have\r\n\r\n      shown greater grief had the body been that of his own son. I noticed,\r\n\r\n      while all the rest of us were more or less undressed and barefooted, that\r\n\r\n      he was fully clothed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had not left the body. Kneeling on the flagstones by the\r\n\r\n      light of Daddy Jacques\u2019s lantern he removed the clothes from the body and\r\n\r\n      laid bare its breast. Then snatching the lantern from Daddy Jacques, he\r\n\r\n      held it over the corpse and saw a gaping wound. Rising suddenly he\r\n\r\n      exclaimed in a voice filled with savage irony:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe man you believe to have been shot was killed by the stab of a knife\r\n\r\n      in his heart!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I thought Rouletabille had gone mad; but, bending over the body, I quickly\r\n\r\n      satisfied myself that Rouletabille was right. Not a sign of a bullet\r\n\r\n      anywhere\u2014the wound, evidently made by a sharp blade, had penetrated\r\n\r\n      the heart.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXIII. The Double Scent\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I had hardly recovered from the surprise into which this new discovery had\r\n\r\n      plunged me, when Rouletabille touched me on the shoulder and asked me to\r\n\r\n      follow him into his room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat are we going to do there?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo think the matter over.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I confess I was in no condition for doing much thinking, nor could I\r\n\r\n      understand how Rouletabille could so control himself as to be able calmly\r\n\r\n      to sit down for reflection when he must have known that Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson was at that moment almost on the point of death. But his\r\n\r\n      self-control was more than I could explain. Closing the door of his room,\r\n\r\n      he motioned me to a chair and, seating himself before me, took out his\r\n\r\n      pipe. We sat there for some time in silence and then I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When I awoke it was daylight. It was eight o\u2019clock by my watch.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was no longer in the room. I rose to go out when the door\r\n\r\n      opened and my friend re-entered. He had evidently lost no time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow about Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d I asked him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHer condition, though very alarming, is not desperate.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen did you leave this room?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTowards dawn.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI guess you have been hard at work?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRather!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you found out anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTwo sets of footprints!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo they explain anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave they anything to do with the mystery of the keeper\u2019s body?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; the mystery is no longer a mystery. This morning, walking round the\r\n\r\n      chateau, I found two distinct sets of footprints, made at the same time,\r\n\r\n      last night. They were made by two persons walking side by side. I followed\r\n\r\n      them from the court towards the oak grove. Larsan joined me. They were the\r\n\r\n      same kind of footprints as were made at the time of the assault in The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room\u2014one set was from clumsy boots and the other was made by\r\n\r\n      neat ones, except that the big toe of one of the sets was of a different\r\n\r\n      size from the one measured in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d incident. I compared the\r\n\r\n      marks with the paper patterns I had previously made.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill following the tracks of the prints, Larsan and I passed out of the\r\n\r\n      oak grove and reached the border of the lake. There they turned off to a\r\n\r\n      little path leading to the high road to Epinay where we lost the traces in\r\n\r\n      the newly macadamised highway.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe went back to the chateau and parted at the courtyard. We met again,\r\n\r\n      however, in Daddy Jacques\u2019s room to which our separate trains of thinking\r\n\r\n      had led us both. We found the old servant in bed. His clothes on the chair\r\n\r\n      were wet through and his boots very muddy. He certainly did not get into\r\n\r\n      that state in helping us to carry the body of the keeper. It was not\r\n\r\n      raining then. Then his face showed extreme fatigue and he looked at us out\r\n\r\n      of terror-stricken eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn our first questioning him he told us that he had gone to bed\r\n\r\n      immediately after the doctor had arrived. On pressing him, however, for it\r\n\r\n      was evident to us he was not speaking the truth, he confessed that he had\r\n\r\n      been away from the chateau. He explained his absence by saying that he had\r\n\r\n      a headache and went out into the fresh air, but had gone no further than\r\n\r\n      the oak grove. When we then described to him the whole route he had\r\n\r\n      followed, he sat up in bed trembling.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And you were not alone!\u2019 cried Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Did you see it then?\u2019 gasped Daddy Jacques.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The phantom\u2014the black phantom!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen he told us that for several nights he had seen what he kept calling\r\n\r\n      the black phantom. It came into the park at the stroke of midnight and\r\n\r\n      glided stealthily through the trees; it appeared to him to pass through\r\n\r\n      the trunks of the trees. Twice he had seen it from his window, by the\r\n\r\n      light of the moon and had risen and followed the strange apparition. The\r\n\r\n      night before last he had almost overtaken it; but it had vanished at the\r\n\r\n      corner of the donjon. Last night, however, he had not left the chateau,\r\n\r\n      his mind being disturbed by a presentiment that some new crime would be\r\n\r\n      attempted. Suddenly he saw the black phantom rush out from somewhere in\r\n\r\n      the middle of the court. He followed it to the lake and to the high road\r\n\r\n      to Epinay, where the phantom suddenly disappeared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Did you see his face?\u2019 demanded Larsan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No!\u2014I saw nothing but black veils.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Did you go out after what passed on the gallery?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I could not!\u2014I was terrified.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Daddy Jacques,\u2019 I said, in a threatening voice, \u2018you did not follow it;\r\n\r\n      you and the phantom walked to Epinay together\u2014arm in arm!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No!\u2019 he cried, turning his eyes away, \u2018I did not. It came on to pour,\r\n\r\n      and\u2014I turned back. I don\u2019t know what became of the black phantom.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe left him, and when we were outside I turned to Larsan, looking him\r\n\r\n      full in the face, and put my question suddenly to take him off his guard:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018An accomplice?\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018How can I tell?\u2019 he replied, shrugging his shoulders. \u2018You can\u2019t be sure\r\n\r\n      of anything in a case like this. Twenty-four hours ago I would have sworn\r\n\r\n      that there was no accomplice!\u2019 He left me saying he was off to Epinay.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, what do you make of it?\u201d I asked Rouletabille, after he had ended\r\n\r\n      his recital. \u201cPersonally I am utterly in the dark. I can\u2019t make anything\r\n\r\n      out of it. What do you gather?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEverything! Everything!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cBut,\u201d he said abruptly, \u201clet\u2019s\r\n\r\n      find out more about Mademoiselle Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXIV. Rouletabille Knows the Two Halves of the Murderer\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had been almost murdered for the second time.\r\n\r\n      Unfortunately, she was in too weak a state to bear the severer injuries of\r\n\r\n      this second attack as well as she had those of the first. She had received\r\n\r\n      three wounds in the breast from the murderer\u2019s knife, and she lay long\r\n\r\n      between life and death. Her strong physique, however, saved her; but\r\n\r\n      though she recovered physically it was found that her mind had been\r\n\r\n      affected. The slightest allusion to the terrible incident sent her into\r\n\r\n      delirium, and the arrest of Robert Darzac which followed on the day\r\n\r\n      following the tragic death of the keeper seemed to sink her fine\r\n\r\n      intelligence into complete melancholia.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac arrived at the chateau towards half-past nine. I saw him\r\n\r\n      hurrying through the park, his hair and clothes in disorder and his face a\r\n\r\n      deadly white. Rouletabille and I were looking out of a window in the\r\n\r\n      gallery. He saw us, and gave a despairing cry: \u201cI\u2019m too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille answered: \u201cShe lives!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A minute later Darzac had gone into Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room and,\r\n\r\n      through the door, we could hear his heart-rending sobs.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s a fate about this place!\u201d groaned Rouletabille. \u201cSome infernal\r\n\r\n      gods must be watching over the misfortunes of this family!\u2014If I had\r\n\r\n      not been drugged, I should have saved Mademoiselle Stangerson. I should\r\n\r\n      have silenced him forever. And the keeper would not have been killed!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac came in to speak with us. His distress was terrible.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille told him everything: his preparations for Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s safety; his plans for either capturing or for disposing of\r\n\r\n      the assailant for ever; and how he would have succeeded had it not been\r\n\r\n      for the drugging.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf only you had trusted me!\u201d said the young man, in a low tone. \u201cIf you\r\n\r\n      had but begged Mademoiselle Stangerson to confide in me!\u2014But, then,\r\n\r\n      everybody here distrusts everybody else, the daughter distrusts her\r\n\r\n      father, and even her lover. While you ask me to protect her she is doing\r\n\r\n      all she can to frustrate me. That was why I came on the scene too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      At Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s request Rouletabille described the whole\r\n\r\n      scene. Leaning on the wall, to prevent himself from falling, he had made\r\n\r\n      his way to Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room, while we were running after the\r\n\r\n      supposed murderer. The ante-room door was open and when he entered he\r\n\r\n      found Mademoiselle Stangerson lying partly thrown over the desk. Her\r\n\r\n      dressing-gown was dyed with the blood flowing from her bosom. Still under\r\n\r\n      the influence of the drug, he felt he was walking in a horrible nightmare.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He went back to the gallery automatically, opened a window, shouted his\r\n\r\n      order to fire, and then returned to the room. He crossed the deserted\r\n\r\n      boudoir, entered the drawing-room, and tried to rouse Monsieur Stangerson\r\n\r\n      who was lying on a sofa. Monsieur Stangerson rose stupidly and let himself\r\n\r\n      be drawn by Rouletabille into the room where, on seeing his daughter\u2019s\r\n\r\n      body, he uttered a heart-rending cry. Both united their feeble strength\r\n\r\n      and carried her to her bed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On his way to join us Rouletabille passed by the desk. On the floor, near\r\n\r\n      it, he saw a large packet. He knelt down and, finding the wrapper loose,\r\n\r\n      he examined it, and made out an enormous quantity of papers and\r\n\r\n      photographs. On one of the papers he read: \u201cNew differential electroscopic\r\n\r\n      condenser. Fundamental properties of substance intermediary between\r\n\r\n      ponderable matter and imponderable ether.\u201d Strange irony of fate that the\r\n\r\n      professor\u2019s precious papers should be restored to him at the very time\r\n\r\n      when an attempt was being made to deprive him of his daughter\u2019s life! What\r\n\r\n      are papers worth to him now?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The morning following that awful night saw Monsieur de Marquet once more\r\n\r\n      at the chateau, with his Registrar and gendarmes. Of course we were all\r\n\r\n      questioned. Rouletabille and I had already agreed on what to say. I kept\r\n\r\n      back any information as to my being in the dark closet and said nothing\r\n\r\n      about the drugging. We did not wish to suggest in any way that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson had been expecting her nocturnal visitor. The poor\r\n\r\n      woman might, perhaps, never recover, and it was none of our business to\r\n\r\n      lift the veil of a secret the preservation of which she had paid for so\r\n\r\n      dearly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Arthur Rance told everybody, in a manner so natural that it astonished me,\r\n\r\n      that he had last seen the keeper towards eleven o\u2019clock of that fatal\r\n\r\n      night. He had come for his valise, he said, which he was to take for him\r\n\r\n      early next morning to the Saint-Michel station, and had been kept out late\r\n\r\n      running after poachers. Arthur Rance had, indeed, intended to leave the\r\n\r\n      chateau and, according to his habit, to walk to the station.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson confirmed what Rance had said, adding that he had not\r\n\r\n      asked Rance to dine with him because his friend had taken his final leave\r\n\r\n      of them both earlier in the evening. Monsieur Rance had had tea served him\r\n\r\n      in his room, because he had complained of a slight indisposition.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Bernier testified, instructed by Rouletabille, that the keeper had ordered\r\n\r\n      him to meet at a spot near the oak grove, for the purpose of looking out\r\n\r\n      for poachers. Finding that the keeper did not keep his appointment, he,\r\n\r\n      Bernier, had gone in search of him. He had almost arrived at the donjon,\r\n\r\n      when he saw a figure running swiftly in a direction opposite to him,\r\n\r\n      towards the right wing of the chateau. He heard revolver shots from behind\r\n\r\n      the figure and saw Rouletabille at one of the gallery windows. He heard\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille call out to him to fire, and he had fired. He believed he had\r\n\r\n      killed the man until he learned, after Rouletabille had uncovered the\r\n\r\n      body, that the man had died from a knife thrust. Who had given it he could\r\n\r\n      not imagine. \u201cNobody could have been near the spot without my seeing him.\u201d\r\n\r\n       When the examining magistrate reminded him that the spot where the body\r\n\r\n      was found was very dark and that he himself had not been able to recognise\r\n\r\n      the keeper before firing, Daddy Bernier replied that neither had they seen\r\n\r\n      the other body; nor had they found it. In the narrow court where five\r\n\r\n      people were standing it would have been strange if the other body, had it\r\n\r\n      been there, could have escaped. The only door that opened into the court\r\n\r\n      was that of the keeper\u2019s room, and that door was closed, and the key of it\r\n\r\n      was found in the keeper\u2019s pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      However that might be, the examining magistrate did not pursue his inquiry\r\n\r\n      further in this direction. He was evidently convinced that we had missed\r\n\r\n      the man we were chasing and we had come upon the keeper\u2019s body in our\r\n\r\n      chase. This matter of the keeper was another matter entirely. He wanted to\r\n\r\n      satisfy himself about that without any further delay. Probably it fitted\r\n\r\n      in with the conclusions he had already arrived at as to the keeper and his\r\n\r\n      intrigues with the wife of Mathieu, the landlord of the Donjon Inn. This\r\n\r\n      Mathieu, later in the afternoon, was arrested and taken to Corbeil in\r\n\r\n      spite of his rheumatism. He had been heard to threaten the keeper, and\r\n\r\n      though no evidence against him had been found at his inn, the evidence of\r\n\r\n      carters who had heard the threats was enough to justify his retention.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The examination had proceeded thus far when, to our surprise, Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan returned to the chateau. He was accompanied by one of the employeees\r\n\r\n      of the railway. At that moment Rance and I were in the vestibule\r\n\r\n      discussing Mathieu\u2019s guilt or innocence, while Rouletabille stood apart\r\n\r\n      buried, apparently, in thought. The examining magistrate and his Registrar\r\n\r\n      were in the little green drawing-room, while Darzac was with the doctor\r\n\r\n      and Stangerson in the lady\u2019s chamber. As Frederic Larsan entered the\r\n\r\n      vestibule with the railway employee, Rouletabille and I at once recognised\r\n\r\n      him by the small blond beard. We exchanged meaningful glances. Larsan had\r\n\r\n      himself announced to the examining magistrate by the gendarme and entered\r\n\r\n      with the railway servant as Daddy Jacques came out. Some ten minutes went\r\n\r\n      by during which Rouletabille appeared extremely impatient. The door of the\r\n\r\n      drawing-room was then opened and we heard the magistrate calling to the\r\n\r\n      gendarme who entered. Presently he came out, mounted the stairs and,\r\n\r\n      coming back shortly, went in to the magistrate and said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u2014Monsieur Robert Darzac will not come!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat! Not come!\u201d cried Monsieur de Marquet.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe says he cannot leave Mademoiselle Stangerson in her present state.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d said Monsieur de Marquet; \u201cthen we\u2019ll go to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet and the gendarme mounted the stairs. He made a sign to\r\n\r\n      Larsan and the railroad employee to follow. Rouletabille and I went along\r\n\r\n      too.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On reaching the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber, Monsieur de\r\n\r\n      Marquet knocked. A chambermaid appeared. It was Sylvia, with her hair all\r\n\r\n      in disorder and consternation showing on her face.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs Monsieur Stangerson within?\u201d asked the magistrate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTell him that I wish to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Stangerson came out. His appearance was wretched in the extreme.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he demanded of the magistrate. \u201cMay I not be left in\r\n\r\n      peace, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the magistrate, \u201cit is absolutely necessary that I should\r\n\r\n      see Monsieur Darzac at once. If you cannot induce him to come, I shall be\r\n\r\n      compelled to use the help of the law.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The professor made no reply. He looked at us all like a man being led to\r\n\r\n      execution, and then went back into the room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Almost immediately after Monsieur Robert Darzac came out. He was very\r\n\r\n      pale. He looked at us and, his eyes falling on the railway servant, his\r\n\r\n      features stiffened and he could hardly repress a groan.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We were all much moved by the appearance of the man. We felt that what was\r\n\r\n      about to happen would decide the fate of Monsieur Robert Darzac. Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan\u2019s face alone was radiant, showing a joy as of a dog that had at\r\n\r\n      last got its prey.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Pointing to the railway servant, Monsieur de Marquet said to Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Darzac:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you recognise this man, Monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac, in a tone which he vainly tried to make\r\n\r\n      firm. \u201cHe is an employee at the station at Epinay-sur-Orge.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis young man,\u201d went on Monsieur de Marquet, \u201caffirms that he saw you\r\n\r\n      get off the train at Epinay-sur-Orge\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat night,\u201d said Monsieur Darzac, interrupting, \u201cat half-past ten\u2014it\r\n\r\n      is quite true.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      An interval of silence followed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac,\u201d the magistrate went on in a tone of deep emotion,\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac, what were you doing that night, at Epinay-sur-Orge\u2014at\r\n\r\n      that time?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac remained silent, simply closing his eyes.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac,\u201d insisted Monsieur de Marquet, \u201ccan you tell me how you\r\n\r\n      employeed your time, that night?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac opened his eyes. He seemed to have recovered his\r\n\r\n      self-control.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThink, Monsieur! For, if you persist in your strange refusal, I shall be\r\n\r\n      under the painful necessity of keeping you at my disposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI refuse.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac!\u2014in the name of the law, I arrest you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The magistrate had no sooner pronounced the words than I saw Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      move quickly towards Monsieur Darzac. He would certainly have spoken to\r\n\r\n      him, but Darzac, by a gesture, held him off. As the gendarme approached\r\n\r\n      his prisoner, a despairing cry rang through the room:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRobert!\u2014Robert!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      We recognised the voice of Mademoiselle Stangerson. We all shuddered.\r\n\r\n      Larsan himself turned pale. Monsieur Darzac, in response to the cry, had\r\n\r\n      flown back into the room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The magistrate, the gendarme, and Larsan followed closely after.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille and I remained on the threshold. It was a heart-breaking\r\n\r\n      sight that met our eyes. Mademoiselle Stangerson, with a face of deathly\r\n\r\n      pallor, had risen on her bed, in spite of the restraining efforts of two\r\n\r\n      doctors and her father. She was holding out her trembling arms towards\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac, on whom Larsan and the gendarme had laid hands. Her\r\n\r\n      distended eyes saw\u2014she understood\u2014her lips seemed to form a\r\n\r\n      word, but nobody made it out; and she fell back insensible.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac was hurried out of the room and placed in the vestibule to\r\n\r\n      wait for the vehicle Larsan had gone to fetch. We were all overcome by\r\n\r\n      emotion and even Monsieur de Marquet had tears in his eyes. Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      took advantage of the opportunity to say to Monsieur Darzac:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you going to put in any defense?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo!\u201d replied the prisoner.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well, then I will, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou cannot do it,\u201d said the unhappy man with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can\u2014and I will.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s voice had in it a strange strength and confidence.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI can do it, Monsieur Robert Darzac, because I know more than you do!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCome! Come!\u201d murmured Darzac, almost angrily.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave no fear! I shall know only what will benefit you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou must know nothing, young man, if you want me to be grateful.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille shook his head, going close up to Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cListen to what I am about to say,\u201d he said in a low tone, \u201cand let it\r\n\r\n      give you confidence. You do not know the name of the murderer.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson knows it; but only half of it; but I know his two\r\n\r\n      halves; I know the whole man!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Robert Darzac opened his eyes, with a look that showed he had not\r\n\r\n      understood a word of what Rouletabille had said to him. At that moment the\r\n\r\n      conveyance arrived, driven by Frederic Larsan. Darzac and the gendarme\r\n\r\n      entered it, Larsan remaining on the driver\u2019s seat. The prisoner was taken\r\n\r\n      to Corbeil.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXV. Rouletabille Goes on a Journey\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      That same evening Rouletabille and I left the Glandier. We were very glad\r\n\r\n      to get away and there was nothing more to keep us there. I declared my\r\n\r\n      intention to give up the whole matter. It had been too much for me.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, with a friendly tap on my shoulder, confessed that he had\r\n\r\n      nothing more to learn at the Glandier; he had learned there all it had to\r\n\r\n      tell him. We reached Paris about eight o\u2019clock, dined, and then, tired\r\n\r\n      out, we separated, agreeing to meet the next morning at my rooms.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille arrived next day at the hour agreed on. He was dressed in a\r\n\r\n      suit of English tweed, with an ulster on his arm, and a valise in his\r\n\r\n      hand. Evidently he had prepared himself for a journey.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow long shall you be away?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cA month or two,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all depends.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I asked him no more questions.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you know,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat the word was that Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      tried to say before she fainted?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo\u2014nobody heard it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI heard it!\u201d replied Rouletabille. \u201cShe said \u2018Speak!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you think Darzac will speak?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was about to make some further observations, but he wrung my hand warmly\r\n\r\n      and wished me good-bye. I had only time to ask him one question before he\r\n\r\n      left.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you not afraid that other attempts may be made while you\u2019re away?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo! Not now that Darzac is in prison,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With this strange remark he left. I was not to see him again until the day\r\n\r\n      of Darzac\u2019s trial at the court when he appeared to explain the\r\n\r\n      inexplicable.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXVI. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Is Awaited with Impatience\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the 15th of January, that is to say, two months and a half after the\r\n\r\n      tragic events I have narrated, the \u201cEpoque\u201d printed, as the first column\r\n\r\n      of the front page, the following sensational article: \u201cThe Seine-et-Oise\r\n\r\n      jury is summoned to-day to give its verdict on one of the most mysterious\r\n\r\n      affairs in the annals of crime. There never has been a case with so many\r\n\r\n      obscure, incomprehensible, and inexplicable points. And yet the\r\n\r\n      prosecution has not hesitated to put into the prisoner\u2019s dock a man who is\r\n\r\n      respected, esteemed, and loved by all who knew him\u2014a young savant,\r\n\r\n      the hope of French science, whose whole life has been devoted to knowledge\r\n\r\n      and truth. When Paris heard of Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s arrest a unanimous\r\n\r\n      cry of protest arose from all sides. The whole Sorbonne, disgraced by this\r\n\r\n      act of the examining magistrate, asserted its belief in the innocence of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s fiance. Monsieur Stangerson was loud in his\r\n\r\n      denunciation of this miscarriage of justice. There is no doubt in the mind\r\n\r\n      of anybody that could the victim speak she would claim from the jurors of\r\n\r\n      Seine-et-Oise the man she wishes to make her husband and whom the\r\n\r\n      prosecution would send to the scaffold. It is to be hoped that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson will shortly recover her reason, which has been\r\n\r\n      temporarily unhinged by the horrible mystery at the Glandier. The question\r\n\r\n      before the jury is the one we propose to deal with this very day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have decided not to permit twelve worthy men to commit a disgraceful\r\n\r\n      miscarriage of justice. We confess that the remarkable coincidences, the\r\n\r\n      many convicting evidences, and the inexplicable silence on the part of the\r\n\r\n      accused, as well as a total absence of any evidence for an alibi, were\r\n\r\n      enough to warrant the bench of judges in assuming that in this man alone\r\n\r\n      was centered the truth of the affair. The evidences are, in appearance, so\r\n\r\n      overwhelming against Monsieur Robert Darzac that a detective so well\r\n\r\n      informed, so intelligent, and generally so successful, as Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan, may be excused for having been misled by them. Up to now\r\n\r\n      everything has gone against Monsieur Robert Darzac in the magisterial\r\n\r\n      inquiry. To-day, however, we are going to defend him before the jury, and\r\n\r\n      we are going to bring to the witness stand a light that will illumine the\r\n\r\n      whole mystery of the Glandier. For we possess the truth.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf we have not spoken sooner, it is because the interests of certain\r\n\r\n      parties in the case demand that we should take that course. Our readers\r\n\r\n      may remember the unsigned reports we published relating to the \u2018Left foot\r\n\r\n      of the Rue Oberkampf,\u2019 at the time of the famous robbery of the Credit\r\n\r\n      Universel, and the famous case of the \u2018Gold Ingots of the Mint.\u2019 In both\r\n\r\n      those cases we were able to discover the truth long before even the\r\n\r\n      excellent ingenuity of Frederic Larsan had been able to unravel it. These\r\n\r\n      reports were written by our youngest reporter, Joseph Rouletabille, a\r\n\r\n      youth of eighteen, whose fame to-morrow will be world-wide. When attention\r\n\r\n      was first drawn to the Glandier case, our youthful reporter was on the\r\n\r\n      spot and installed in the chateau, when every other representative of the\r\n\r\n      press had been denied admission. He worked side by side with Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan. He was amazed and terrified at the grave mistake the celebrated\r\n\r\n      detective was about to make, and tried to divert him from the false scent\r\n\r\n      he was following; but the great Fred refused to receive instructions from\r\n\r\n      this young journalist. We know now where it brought Monsieur Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut now, France must know\u2014the whole world must know, that, on the\r\n\r\n      very evening on which Monsieur Darzac was arrested, young Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      entered our editorial office and informed us that he was about to go away\r\n\r\n      on a journey. \u2018How long I shall be away,\u2019 he said, \u2018I cannot say; perhaps\r\n\r\n      a month\u2014perhaps two\u2014perhaps three\u2014perhaps I may never return.\r\n\r\n      Here is a letter. If I am not back on the day on which Monsieur Darzac is\r\n\r\n      to appear before the Assize Court, have this letter opened and read to the\r\n\r\n      court, after all the witnesses have been heard. Arrange it with Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Darzac\u2019s counsel. Monsieur Darzac is innocent. In this letter is written\r\n\r\n      the name of the murderer; and\u2014that is all I have to say. I am\r\n\r\n      leaving to get my proofs\u2014for the irrefutable evidence of the\r\n\r\n      murderer\u2019s guilt.\u2019 Our reporter departed. For a long time we were without\r\n\r\n      news from him; but, a week ago, a stranger called upon our manager and\r\n\r\n      said: \u2018Act in accordance with the instructions of Joseph Rouletabille, if\r\n\r\n      it becomes necessary to do so. The letter left by him holds the truth.\u2019\r\n\r\n      The gentleman who brought us this message would not give us his name.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo-day, the 15th of January, is the day of the trial. Joseph Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      has not returned. It may be we shall never see him again. The press also\r\n\r\n      counts its heroes, its martyrs to duty. It may be he is no longer living.\r\n\r\n      We shall know how to avenge him. Our manager will, this afternoon, be at\r\n\r\n      the Court of Assize at Versailles, with the letter\u2014the letter\r\n\r\n      containing the name of the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Those Parisians who flocked to the Assize Court at Versailles, to be\r\n\r\n      present at the trial of what was known as the \u201cMystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room,\u201d will certainly remember the terrible crush at the Saint-Lazare\r\n\r\n      station. The ordinary trains were so full that special trains had to be\r\n\r\n      made up. The article in the \u201cEpoque\u201d had so excited the populace that\r\n\r\n      discussion was rife everywhere even to the verge of blows. Partisans of\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille fought with the supporters of Frederic Larsan. Curiously\r\n\r\n      enough the excitement was due less to the fact that an innocent man was in\r\n\r\n      danger of a wrongful conviction than to the interest taken in their own\r\n\r\n      ideas as to the Mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. Each had his explanation to\r\n\r\n      which each held fast. Those who explained the crime on Frederic Larsan\u2019s\r\n\r\n      theory would not admit that there could be any doubt as to the\r\n\r\n      perspicacity of the popular detective. Others who had arrived at a\r\n\r\n      different solution, naturally insisted that this was Rouletabille\u2019s\r\n\r\n      explanation, though they did not as yet know what that was.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      With the day\u2019s \u201cEpoque\u201d in their hands, the \u201cLarsans\u201d and the\r\n\r\n      \u201cRouletabilles\u201d fought and shoved each other on the steps of the Palais de\r\n\r\n      Justice, right into the court itself. Those who could not get in remained\r\n\r\n      in the neighbourhood until evening and were, with great difficulty, kept\r\n\r\n      back by the soldiery and the police. They became hungry for news,\r\n\r\n      welcoming the most absurd rumours. At one time the rumour spread that\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson himself had been arrested in the court and had\r\n\r\n      confessed to being the murderer. This goes to show to what a pitch of\r\n\r\n      madness nervous excitement may carry people. Rouletabille was still\r\n\r\n      expected. Some pretended to know him; and when a young man with a \u201cpass\u201d\r\n\r\n       crossed the open space which separated the crowd from the Court House, a\r\n\r\n      scuffle took place. Cries were raised of \u201cRouletabille!\u2014there\u2019s\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille!\u201d The arrival of the manager of the paper was the signal for\r\n\r\n      a great demonstration. Some applauded, others hissed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The trial itself was presided over by Monsieur de Rocouz, a judge filled\r\n\r\n      with the prejudice of his class, but a man honest at heart. The witnesses\r\n\r\n      had been called. I was there, of course, as were all who had, in any way,\r\n\r\n      been in touch with the mysteries of the Glandier. Monsieur Stangerson\u2014looking\r\n\r\n      many years older and almost unrecognisable\u2014Larsan, Arthur Rance,\r\n\r\n      with his face ruddy as ever, Daddy Jacques, Daddy Mathieu, who was brought\r\n\r\n      into court handcuffed between two gendarmes, Madame Mathieu, in tears, the\r\n\r\n      two Berniers, the two nurses, the steward, all the domestics of the\r\n\r\n      chateau, the employee of the Paris Post Office, the railway employee from\r\n\r\n      Epinay, some friends of Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson, and all\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac\u2019s witnesses. I was lucky enough to be called early in the\r\n\r\n      trial, so that I was then able to watch and be present at almost the whole\r\n\r\n      of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The court was so crowded that many lawyers were compelled to find seats on\r\n\r\n      the steps. Behind the bench of justices were representatives from other\r\n\r\n      benches. Monsieur Robert Darzac stood in the prisoner\u2019s dock between\r\n\r\n      policemen, tall, handsome, and calm. A murmur of admiration rather than of\r\n\r\n      compassion greeted his appearance. He leaned forward towards his counsel,\r\n\r\n      Maitre Henri Robert, who, assisted by his chief secretary, Maitre Andre\r\n\r\n      Hesse, was busily turning over the folios of his brief.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Many expected that Monsieur Stangerson, after giving his evidence, would\r\n\r\n      have gone over to the prisoner and shaken hands with him; but he left the\r\n\r\n      court without another word. It was remarked that the jurors appeared to be\r\n\r\n      deeply interested in a rapid conversation which the manager of the\r\n\r\n      \u201cEpoque\u201d was having with Maitre Henri Robert. The manager, later, sat down\r\n\r\n      in the front row of the public seats. Some were surprised that he was not\r\n\r\n      asked to remain with the other witnesses in the room reserved for them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The reading of the indictment was got through, as it always is, without\r\n\r\n      any incident. I shall not here report the long examination to which\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac was subjected. He answered all the questions quickly and\r\n\r\n      easily. His silence as to the important matters of which we know was dead\r\n\r\n      against him. It would seem as if this reticence would be fatal for him. He\r\n\r\n      resented the President\u2019s reprimands. He was told that his silence might\r\n\r\n      mean death.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well,\u201d he said; \u201cI will submit to it; but I am innocent.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      With that splendid ability which has made his fame, Maitre Robert took\r\n\r\n      advantage of the incident, and tried to show that it brought out in noble\r\n\r\n      relief his client\u2019s character; for only heroic natures could remain silent\r\n\r\n      for moral reasons in face of such a danger. The eminent advocate however,\r\n\r\n      only succeeded in assuring those who were already assured of Darzac\u2019s\r\n\r\n      innocence. At the adjournment Rouletabille had not yet arrived. Every time\r\n\r\n      a door opened, all eyes there turned towards it and back to the manager of\r\n\r\n      the \u201cEpoque,\u201d who sat impassive in his place. When he once was feeling in\r\n\r\n      his pocket a loud murmur of expectation followed. The letter!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It is not, however, my intention to report in detail the course of the\r\n\r\n      trial. My readers are sufficiently acquainted with the mysteries\r\n\r\n      surrounding the Glandier case to enable me to go on to the really dramatic\r\n\r\n      denouement of this ever-memorable day.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      When the trial was resumed, Maitre Henri Robert questioned Daddy Mathieu\r\n\r\n      as to his complicity in the death of the keeper. His wife was also brought\r\n\r\n      in and was confronted by her husband. She burst into tears and confessed\r\n\r\n      that she had been the keeper\u2019s mistress, and that her husband had\r\n\r\n      suspected it. She again, however, affirmed that he had had nothing to do\r\n\r\n      with the murder of her lover. Maitre Henri Robert thereupon asked the\r\n\r\n      court to hear Frederic Larsan on this point.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn a short conversation which I have had with Frederic Larsan, during the\r\n\r\n      adjournment,\u201d declared the advocate, \u201che has made me understand that the\r\n\r\n      death of the keeper may have been brought about otherwise than by the hand\r\n\r\n      of Mathieu. It will be interesting to hear Frederic Larsan\u2019s theory.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan was brought in. His explanation was quite clear.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI see no necessity,\u201d he said, \u201cfor bringing Mathieu in this. I have told\r\n\r\n      Monsieur de Marquet that the man\u2019s threats had biassed the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate against him. To me the attempt to murder Mademoiselle and the\r\n\r\n      death of the keeper are the work of one and the same person. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s murderer, flying through the court, was fired on; it was\r\n\r\n      thought he was struck, perhaps killed. As a matter of fact, he only\r\n\r\n      stumbled at the moment of his disappearance behind the corner of the right\r\n\r\n      wing of the chateau. There he encountered the keeper who, no doubt, tried\r\n\r\n      to seize him. The murderer had in his hand the knife with which he had\r\n\r\n      stabbed Mademoiselle Stangerson and with this he killed the keeper.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      This very simple explanation appeared at once plausible and satisfying. A\r\n\r\n      murmur of approbation was heard.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the murderer? What became of him?\u201d asked the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe was evidently hidden in an obscure corner at the end of the court.\r\n\r\n      After the people had left the court carrying with them the body of the\r\n\r\n      keeper, the murderer quietly made his escape.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The words had scarcely left Larsan\u2019s mouth when from the back of the court\r\n\r\n      came a youthful voice:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI agree with Frederic Larsan as to the death of the keeper; but I do not\r\n\r\n      agree with him as to the way the murderer escaped!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Everybody turned round, astonished. The clerks of the court sprang towards\r\n\r\n      the speaker, calling out silence, and the President angrily ordered the\r\n\r\n      intruder to be immediately expelled. The same clear voice, however, was\r\n\r\n      again heard:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is I, Monsieur President\u2014Joseph Rouletabille!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXVII. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears in All His Glory\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The excitement was extreme. Cries from fainting women were to be heard\r\n\r\n      amid the extraordinary bustle and stir. The \u201cmajesty of the law\u201d was\r\n\r\n      utterly forgotten. The President tried in vain to make himself heard.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille made his way forward with difficulty, but by dint of much\r\n\r\n      elbowing reached his manager and greeted him cordially. The letter was\r\n\r\n      passed to him and pocketing it he turned to the witness-box. He was\r\n\r\n      dressed exactly as on the day he left me even to the ulster over his arm.\r\n\r\n      Turning to the President, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI beg your pardon, Monsieur President, but I have only just arrived from\r\n\r\n      America. The steamer was late. My name is Joseph Rouletabille!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The silence which followed his stepping into the witness-box was broken by\r\n\r\n      laughter when his words were heard. Everybody seemed relieved and glad to\r\n\r\n      find him there, as if in the expectation of hearing the truth at last.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      But the President was extremely incensed:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo, you are Joseph Rouletabille,\u201d he replied; \u201cwell, young man, I\u2019ll\r\n\r\n      teach you what comes of making a farce of justice. By virtue of my\r\n\r\n      discretionary power, I hold you at the court\u2019s disposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI ask nothing better, Monsieur President. I have come here for that\r\n\r\n      purpose. I humbly beg the court\u2019s pardon for the disturbance of which I\r\n\r\n      have been the innocent cause. I beg you to believe that nobody has a\r\n\r\n      greater respect for the court than I have. I came in as I could.\u201d He\r\n\r\n      smiled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cTake him away!\u201d ordered the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Maitre Henri Robert intervened. He began by apologising for the young man,\r\n\r\n      who, he said, was moved only by the best intentions. He made the President\r\n\r\n      understand that the evidence of a witness who had slept at the Glandier\r\n\r\n      during the whole of that eventful week could not be omitted, and the\r\n\r\n      present witness, moreover, had come to name the real murderer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAre you going to tell us who the murderer was?\u201d asked the President,\r\n\r\n      somewhat convinced though still sceptical.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have come for that purpose, Monsieur President!\u201d replied Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      An attempt at applause was silenced by the usher.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cJoseph Rouletabille,\u201d said Maitre Henri Robert, \u201chas not been regularly\r\n\r\n      subpoenaed as a witness, but I hope, Monsieur President, you will examine\r\n\r\n      him in virtue of your discretionary powers.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well!\u201d said the President, \u201cwe will question him. But we must\r\n\r\n      proceed in order.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The Advocate-General rose:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt would, perhaps, be better,\u201d he said, \u201cif the young man were to tell us\r\n\r\n      now whom he suspects.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President nodded ironically:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf the Advocate-General attaches importance to the deposition of Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Joseph Rouletabille, I see no reason why this witness should not give us\r\n\r\n      the name of the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A pin drop could have been heard. Rouletabille stood silent looking\r\n\r\n      sympathetically at Darzac, who, for the first time since the opening of\r\n\r\n      the trial, showed himself agitated.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell,\u201d cried the President, \u201cwe wait for the name of the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n       Rouletabille, feeling in his waistcoat pocket, drew his watch and, looking\r\n\r\n      at it, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur President, I cannot name the murderer before half-past six\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Loud murmurs of disappointment filled the room. Some of the lawyers were\r\n\r\n      heard to say: \u201cHe\u2019s making fun of us!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President in a stern voice, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis joke has gone far enough. You may retire, Monsieur, into the\r\n\r\n      witnesses\u2019 room. I hold you at our disposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille protested.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI assure you, Monsieur President,\u201d he cried in his sharp, clear voice,\r\n\r\n      \u201cthat when I do name the murderer you will understand why I could not\r\n\r\n      speak before half-past six. I assert this on my honour. I can, however,\r\n\r\n      give you now some explanation of the murder of the keeper. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan, who has seen me at work at the Glandier, can tell you\r\n\r\n      with what care I studied this case. I found myself compelled to differ\r\n\r\n      with him in arresting Monsieur Robert Darzac, who is innocent. Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Larsan knows of my good faith and knows that some importance may be\r\n\r\n      attached to my discoveries, which have often corroborated his own.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur President, it will be interesting to hear Monsieur Joseph\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, especially as he differs from me.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A murmur of approbation greeted the detective\u2019s speech. He was a good\r\n\r\n      sportsman and accepted the challenge. The struggle between the two\r\n\r\n      promised to be exciting.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      As the President remained silent, Frederic Larsan continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe agree that the murderer of the keeper was the assailant of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson; but as we are not agreed as to how the murderer\r\n\r\n      escaped, I am curious to hear Monsieur Rouletabille\u2019s explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no doubt you are,\u201d said my friend.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      General laughter followed this remark. The President angrily declared that\r\n\r\n      if it was repeated, he would have the court cleared.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow, young man,\u201d said the President, \u201cyou have heard Monsieur Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan; how did the murderer get away from the court?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked at Madame Mathieu, who smiled back at him sadly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince Madame Mathieu,\u201d he said, \u201chas freely admitted her intimacy with\r\n\r\n      the keeper\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy, it\u2019s the boy!\u201d exclaimed Daddy Mathieu.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cRemove that man!\u201d ordered the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mathieu was removed from the court. Rouletabille went on:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSince she has made this confession, I am free to tell you that she often\r\n\r\n      met the keeper at night on the first floor of the donjon, in the room\r\n\r\n      which was once an oratory. These meetings became more frequent when her\r\n\r\n      husband was laid up by his rheumatism. She gave him morphine to ease his\r\n\r\n      pain and to give herself more time for the meetings. Madame Mathieu came\r\n\r\n      to the chateau that night, enveloped in a large black shawl which served\r\n\r\n      also as a disguise. This was the phantom that disturbed Daddy Jacques. She\r\n\r\n      knew how to imitate the mewing of Mother Angenoux\u2019 cat and she would make\r\n\r\n      the cries to advise the keeper of her presence. The recent repairs of the\r\n\r\n      donjon did not interfere with their meetings in the keeper\u2019s old room, in\r\n\r\n      the donjon, since the new room assigned to him at the end of the right\r\n\r\n      wing was separated from the steward\u2019s room by a partition only.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrevious to the tragedy in the courtyard Madame Mathieu and the keeper\r\n\r\n      left the donjon together. I learnt these facts from my examination of the\r\n\r\n      footmarks in the court the next morning. Bernier, the concierge, whom I\r\n\r\n      had stationed behind the donjon\u2014as he will explain himself\u2014could\r\n\r\n      not see what passed in the court. He did not reach the court until he\r\n\r\n      heard the revolver shots, and then he fired. When the woman parted from\r\n\r\n      the man she went towards the open gate of the court, while he returned to\r\n\r\n      his room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe had almost reached the door when the revolvers rang out. He had just\r\n\r\n      reached the corner when a shadow bounded by. Meanwhile, Madame Mathieu,\r\n\r\n      surprised by the revolver shots and by the entrance of people into the\r\n\r\n      court, crouched in the darkness. The court is a large one and, being near\r\n\r\n      the gate, she might easily have passed out unseen. But she remained and\r\n\r\n      saw the body being carried away. In great agony of mind she neared the\r\n\r\n      vestibule and saw the dead body of her lover on the stairs lit up by Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques\u2019 lantern. She then fled; and Daddy Jacques joined her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat same night, before the murder, Daddy Jacques had been awakened by\r\n\r\n      the cat\u2019s cry, and, looking through his window, had seen the black\r\n\r\n      phantom. Hastily dressing himself he went out and recognised her. He is an\r\n\r\n      old friend of Madame Mathieu, and when she saw him she had to tell him of\r\n\r\n      her relations with the keeper and begged his assistance. Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      took pity on her and accompanied her through the oak grove out of the\r\n\r\n      park, past the border of the lake to the road to Epinay. From there it was\r\n\r\n      but a very short distance to her home.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDaddy Jacques returned to the chateau, and, seeing how important it was\r\n\r\n      for Madame Mathieu\u2019s presence at the chateau to remain unknown, he did all\r\n\r\n      he could to hide it. I appeal to Monsieur Larsan, who saw me, next\r\n\r\n      morning, examine the two sets of footprints.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Here Rouletabille turning towards Madame Mathieu, with a bow, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe footprints of Madame bear a strange resemblance to the neat\r\n\r\n      footprints of the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Madame Mathieu trembled and looked at him with wide eyes as if in wonder\r\n\r\n      at what he would say next.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMadame has a shapely foot, long and rather large for a woman. The\r\n\r\n      imprint, with its pointed toe, is very like that of the murderer\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A movement in the court was repressed by Rouletabille. He held their\r\n\r\n      attention at once.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hasten to add,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat I attach no importance to this.\r\n\r\n      Outward signs like these are often liable to lead us into error, if we do\r\n\r\n      not reason rightly. Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s footprints are also like the\r\n\r\n      murderer\u2019s, and yet he is not the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President turning to Madame Mathieu asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs that in accordance with what you know occurred?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur President,\u201d she replied, \u201cit is as if Monsieur Rouletabille\r\n\r\n      had been behind us.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid you see the murderer running towards the end of the right wing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, as clearly as I saw them afterwards carrying the keeper\u2019s body.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat became of the murderer?\u2014You were in the courtyard and could\r\n\r\n      easily have seen.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI saw nothing of him, Monsieur President. It became quite dark just\r\n\r\n      then.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d said the President, \u201cmust explain how the\r\n\r\n      murderer made his escape.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille continued:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was impossible for the murderer to escape by the way he had entered\r\n\r\n      the court without our seeing him; or if we couldn\u2019t see him we must\r\n\r\n      certainly have felt him, since the court is a very narrow one enclosed in\r\n\r\n      high iron railings.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen if the man was hemmed in that narrow square, how is it you did not\r\n\r\n      find him?\u2014I have been asking you that for the last half hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur President,\u201d replied Rouletabille, \u201cI cannot answer that question\r\n\r\n      before half-past six!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      By this time the people in the court-room were beginning to believe in\r\n\r\n      this new witness. They were amused by his melodramatic action in thus\r\n\r\n      fixing the hour; but they seemed to have confidence in the outcome. As for\r\n\r\n      the President, it looked as if he also had made up his mind to take the\r\n\r\n      young man in the same way. He had certainly been impressed by\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille\u2019s explanation of Madame Mathieu\u2019s part.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, Monsieur Rouletabille,\u201d he said, \u201cas you say; but don\u2019t let us see\r\n\r\n      any more of you before half-past six.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille bowed to the President, and made his way to the door of the\r\n\r\n      witnesses\u2019 room.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      I quietly made my way through the crowd and left the court almost at the\r\n\r\n      same time as Rouletabille. He greeted me heartily, and looked happy.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll not ask you, my dear fellow,\u201d I said, smiling, \u201cwhat you\u2019ve been\r\n\r\n      doing in America; because I\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019ll say you can\u2019t tell me until\r\n\r\n      after half-past six.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, my dear Sainclair, I\u2019ll tell you right now why I went to America. I\r\n\r\n      went in search of the name of the other half of the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe name of the other half?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExactly. When we last left the Glandier I knew there were two halves to\r\n\r\n      the murderer and the name of only one of them. I went to America for the\r\n\r\n      name of the other half.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      I was too puzzled to answer. Just then we entered the witnesses\u2019 room, and\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was immediately surrounded. He showed himself very friendly\r\n\r\n      to all except Arthur Rance to whom he exhibited a marked coldness of\r\n\r\n      manner. Frederic Larsan came in also. Rouletabille went up and shook him\r\n\r\n      heartily by the hand. His manner toward the detective showed that he had\r\n\r\n      got the better of the policeman. Larsan smiled and asked him what he had\r\n\r\n      been doing in America, Rouletabille began by telling him some anecdotes of\r\n\r\n      his voyage. They then turned aside together apparently with the object of\r\n\r\n      speaking confidentially. I, therefore, discreetly left them and, being\r\n\r\n      curious to hear the evidence, returned to my seat in the court-room where\r\n\r\n      the public plainly showed its lack of interest in what was going on in\r\n\r\n      their impatience for Rouletabille\u2019s return at the appointed time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      On the stroke of half-past six Joseph Rouletabille was again brought in.\r\n\r\n      It is impossible for me to picture the tense excitement which appeared on\r\n\r\n      every face, as he made his way to the bar. Darzac rose to his feet,\r\n\r\n      frightfully pale.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President, addressing Rouletabille, said gravely:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI will not ask you to take the oath, because you have not been regularly\r\n\r\n      summoned; but I trust there is no need to urge upon you the gravity of the\r\n\r\n      statement you are about to make.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille looked the President quite calmly and steadily in the face,\r\n\r\n      and replied:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt your last appearance here,\u201d said the President, \u201cwe had arrived at the\r\n\r\n      point where you were to tell us how the murderer escaped, and also his\r\n\r\n      name. Now, Monsieur Rouletabille, we await your explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery well, Monsieur,\u201d began my friend amidst a profound silence. \u201cI had\r\n\r\n      explained how it was impossible for the murderer to get away without being\r\n\r\n      seen. And yet he was there with us in the courtyard.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd you did not see him? At least that is what the prosecution declares.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo! We all of us saw him, Monsieur le President!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen why was he not arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause no one, besides myself, knew that he was the murderer. It would\r\n\r\n      have spoiled my plans to have had him arrested, and I had then no proof\r\n\r\n      other than my own reasoning. I was convinced we had the murderer before us\r\n\r\n      and that we were actually looking at him. I have now brought what I\r\n\r\n      consider the indisputable proof.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeak out, Monsieur! Tell us the murderer\u2019s name.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou will find it on the list of names present in the court on the night\r\n\r\n      of the tragedy,\u201d replied Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The people present in the court-room began showing impatience. Some of\r\n\r\n      them even called for the name, and were silenced by the usher.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe list includes Daddy Jacques, Bernier the concierge, and Mr. Arthur\r\n\r\n      Rance,\u201d said the President. \u201cDo you accuse any of these?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen I do not understand what you are driving at. There was no other\r\n\r\n      person at the end of the court.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur, there was, not at the end, but above the court, who was\r\n\r\n      leaning out of the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you mean Frederic Larsan!\u201d exclaimed the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes! Frederic Larsan!\u201d replied Rouletabille in a ringing tone. \u201cFrederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan is the murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The court-room became immediately filled with loud and indignant protests.\r\n\r\n      So astonished was he that the President did not attempt to quiet it. The\r\n\r\n      quick silence which followed was broken by the distinctly whispered words\r\n\r\n      from the lips of Robert Darzac:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s impossible! He\u2019s mad!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou dare to accuse Frederic Larsan, Monsieur?\u201d asked the President. \u201cIf\r\n\r\n      you are not mad, what are your proofs?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cProofs, Monsieur?\u2014Do you want proofs? Well, here is one,\u201d cried\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille shrilly. \u201cLet Frederic Larsan be called!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cUsher, call Frederic Larsan.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The usher hurried to the side door, opened it, and disappeared. The door\r\n\r\n      remained open, while all eyes turned expectantly towards it. The clerk\r\n\r\n      re-appeared and, stepping forward, said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur President, Frederic Larsan is not here. He left at about four\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock and has not been seen since.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is my proof!\u201d cried Rouletabille, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cExplain yourself?\u201d demanded the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy proof is Larsan\u2019s flight,\u201d said the young reporter. \u201cHe will not come\r\n\r\n      back. You will see no more of Frederic Larsan.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cUnless you are playing with the court, Monsieur, why did you not accuse\r\n\r\n      him when he was present? He would then have answered you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe could give no other answer than the one he has now given by his\r\n\r\n      flight.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe cannot believe that Larsan has fled. There was no reason for his doing\r\n\r\n      so. Did he know you\u2019d make this charge?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe did. I told him I would.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you mean to say that knowing Larsan was the murderer you gave him the\r\n\r\n      opportunity to escape?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur President, I did,\u201d replied Rouletabille, proudly. \u201cI am not\r\n\r\n      a policeman, I am a journalist; and my business is not to arrest people.\r\n\r\n      My business is in the service of truth, and is not that of an executioner.\r\n\r\n      If you are just, Monsieur, you will see that I am right. You can now\r\n\r\n      understand why I refrained until this hour to divulge the name. I gave\r\n\r\n      Larsan time to catch the 4:17 train for Paris, where he would know where\r\n\r\n      to hide himself, and leave no traces. You will not find Frederic Larsan,\u201d\r\n\r\n       declared Rouletabille, fixing his eyes on Monsieur Robert Darzac. \u201cHe is\r\n\r\n      too cunning. He is a man who has always escaped you and whom you have long\r\n\r\n      searched for in vain. If he did not succeed in outwitting me, he can yet\r\n\r\n      easily outwit any police. This man who, four years ago, introduced himself\r\n\r\n      to the Surete, and became celebrated as Frederic Larsan, is notorious\r\n\r\n      under another name\u2014a name well known to crime. Frederic Larsan,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur President, is Ballmeyer!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBallmeyer!\u201d cried the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBallmeyer!\u201d exclaimed Robert Darzac, springing to his feet. \u201cBallmeyer!\u2014It\r\n\r\n      was true, then!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! Monsieur Darzac; you don\u2019t think I am mad, now!\u201d cried Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ballmeyer! Ballmeyer! No other word could be heard in the courtroom. The\r\n\r\n      President adjourned the hearing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Those of my readers who may not have heard of Ballmeyer will wonder at the\r\n\r\n      excitement the name caused. And yet the doings of this remarkable criminal\r\n\r\n      form the subject-matter of the most dramatic narratives of the newspapers\r\n\r\n      and criminal records of the past twenty years. It had been reported that\r\n\r\n      he was dead, and thus had eluded the police as he had eluded them\r\n\r\n      throughout the whole of his career.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Ballmeyer was the best specimen of the high-class \u201cgentleman swindler.\u201d He\r\n\r\n      was adept at sleight of hand tricks, and no bolder or more ruthless crook\r\n\r\n      ever lived. He was received in the best society, and was a member of some\r\n\r\n      of the most exclusive clubs. On many of his depredatory expeditions he had\r\n\r\n      not hesitated to use the knife and the mutton-bone. No difficulty stopped\r\n\r\n      him and no \u201coperation\u201d was too dangerous. He had been caught, but escaped\r\n\r\n      on the very morning of his trial, by throwing pepper into the eyes of the\r\n\r\n      guards who were conducting him to Court. It was known later that, in spite\r\n\r\n      of the keen hunt after him by the most expert of detectives, he had sat\r\n\r\n      that same evening at a first performance in the Theatre Francais, without\r\n\r\n      the slightest disguise.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      He left France, later, to \u201cwork\u201d America. The police there succeeded in\r\n\r\n      capturing him once, but the extraordinary man escaped the next day. It\r\n\r\n      would need a volume to recount the adventures of this master-criminal. And\r\n\r\n      yet this was the man Rouletabille had allowed to get away! Knowing all\r\n\r\n      about him and who he was, he afforded the criminal an opportunity for\r\n\r\n      another laugh at the society he had defied! I could not help admiring the\r\n\r\n      bold stroke of the young journalist, because I felt certain his motive had\r\n\r\n      been to protect both Mademoiselle Stangerson and rid Darzac of an enemy at\r\n\r\n      the same time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The crowd had barely recovered from the effect of the astonishing\r\n\r\n      revelation when the hearing was resumed. The question in everybody\u2019s mind\r\n\r\n      was: Admitting that Larsan was the murderer, how did he get out of The\r\n\r\n      Yellow Room?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille was immediately called to the bar and his examination\r\n\r\n      continued.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have told us,\u201d said the President, \u201cthat it was impossible to escape\r\n\r\n      from the end of the court. Since Larsan was leaning out of his window, he\r\n\r\n      had left the court. How did he do that?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe escaped by a most unusual way. He climbed the wall, sprang onto the\r\n\r\n      terrace, and, while we were engaged with the keeper\u2019s body, reached the\r\n\r\n      gallery by the window. He then had little else to do than to open the\r\n\r\n      window, get in and call out to us, as if he had just come from his own\r\n\r\n      room. To a man of Ballmeyer\u2019s strength all that was mere child\u2019s play. And\r\n\r\n      here, Monsieur, is the proof of what I say.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille drew from his pocket a small packet, from which he produced a\r\n\r\n      strong iron peg.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis, Monsieur,\u201d he said, \u201cis a spike which perfectly fits a hole still\r\n\r\n      to be seen in the cornice supporting the terrace. Larsan, who thought and\r\n\r\n      prepared for everything in case of any emergency, had fixed this spike\r\n\r\n      into the cornice. All he had to do to make his escape good was to plant\r\n\r\n      one foot on a stone which is placed at the corner of the chateau, another\r\n\r\n      on this support, one hand on the cornice of the keeper\u2019s door and the\r\n\r\n      other on the terrace, and Larsan was clear of the ground. The rest was\r\n\r\n      easy. His acting after dinner as if he had been drugged was make believe.\r\n\r\n      He was not drugged; but he did drug me. Of course he had to make it appear\r\n\r\n      as if he also had been drugged so that no suspicion should fall on him for\r\n\r\n      my condition. Had I not been thus overpowered, Larsan would never have\r\n\r\n      entered Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber that night, and the attack on\r\n\r\n      her would not have taken place.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A groan came from Darzac, who appeared to be unable to control his\r\n\r\n      suffering.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou can understand,\u201d added Rouletabille, \u201cthat Larsan would feel himself\r\n\r\n      hampered from the fact that my room was so close to his, and from a\r\n\r\n      suspicion that I would be on the watch that night. Naturally, he could not\r\n\r\n      for a moment believe that I suspected him! But I might see him leaving his\r\n\r\n      room when he was about to go to Mademoiselle Stangerson. He waited till I\r\n\r\n      was asleep, and my friend Sainclair was busy trying to rouse me. Ten\r\n\r\n      minutes after that Mademoiselle was calling out, \u201cMurder!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow did you come to suspect Larsan?\u201d asked the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy pure reason pointed to him. That was why I watched him. But I did not\r\n\r\n      foresee the drugging. He is very cunning. Yes, my pure reason pointed to\r\n\r\n      him; but I required tangible proof so that my eyes could see him as my\r\n\r\n      pure reason saw him.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean by your pure reason?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat power of one\u2019s mind which admits of no disturbing elements to a\r\n\r\n      conclusion. The day following the incident of \u2018the inexplicable gallery,\u2019\r\n\r\n      I felt myself losing control of it. I had allowed myself to be diverted by\r\n\r\n      fallacious evidence; but I recovered and again took hold of the right end.\r\n\r\n      I satisfied myself that the murderer could not have left the gallery,\r\n\r\n      either naturally or supernaturally. I narrowed the field of consideration\r\n\r\n      to that small circle, so to speak. The murderer could not be outside that\r\n\r\n      circle. Now who was in it? There was, first, the murderer. Then there were\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques, Monsieur Stangerson, Frederic Larsan, and myself. Five\r\n\r\n      persons in all, counting in the murderer. And yet, in the gallery, there\r\n\r\n      were but four. Now since it had been demonstrated to me that the fifth\r\n\r\n      could not have escaped, it was evident that one of the four present in the\r\n\r\n      gallery must be a double\u2014he must be himself and the murderer also.\r\n\r\n      Why had I not seen this before? Simply because the phenomenon of the\r\n\r\n      double personality had not occurred before in this inquiry.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNow who of the four persons in the gallery was both that person and the\r\n\r\n      assassin? I went over in my mind what I had seen. I had seen at one and\r\n\r\n      the same time, Monsieur Stangerson and the murderer, Daddy Jacques and the\r\n\r\n      murderer, myself and the murderer; so that the murderer, then, could not\r\n\r\n      be either Monsieur Stangerson, Daddy Jacques, or myself. Had I seen\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan and the murderer at the same time?\u2014No!\u2014Two\r\n\r\n      seconds had passed, during which I lost sight of the murderer; for, as I\r\n\r\n      have noted in my papers, he arrived two seconds before Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, Daddy Jacques, and myself at the meeting-point of the two\r\n\r\n      galleries. That would have given Larsan time to go through the\r\n\r\n      \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery, snatch off his false beard, return, and hurry with\r\n\r\n      us as if, like us, in pursuit of the murderer. I was sure now I had got\r\n\r\n      hold of the right end in my reasoning. With Frederic Larsan was now always\r\n\r\n      associated, in my mind, the personality of the unknown of whom I was in\r\n\r\n      pursuit\u2014the murderer, in other words.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat revelation staggered me. I tried to regain my balance by going over\r\n\r\n      the evidences previously traced, but which had diverted my mind and led me\r\n\r\n      away from Frederic Larsan. What were these evidences?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c1st. I had seen the unknown in Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s chamber. On\r\n\r\n      going to Frederic Larsan\u2019s room, I had found Larsan sound asleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c2nd. The ladder.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201c3rd. I had placed Frederic Larsan at the end of the \u2018off-turning\u2019 gallery\r\n\r\n      and had told him that I would rush into Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room to\r\n\r\n      try to capture the murderer. Then I returned to Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s\r\n\r\n      chamber where I had seen the unknown.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe first evidence did not disturb me much. It is likely that, when I\r\n\r\n      descended from my ladder, after having seen the unknown in Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s chamber, Larsan had already finished what he was doing there.\r\n\r\n      Then, while I was re-entering the chateau, Larsan went back to his own\r\n\r\n      room and, undressing himself, went to sleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNor did the second evidence trouble me. If Larsan were the murderer, he\r\n\r\n      could have no use for a ladder; but the ladder might have been placed\r\n\r\n      there to give an appearance to the murderer\u2019s entrance from without the\r\n\r\n      chateau; especially as Larsan had accused Darzac and Darzac was not in the\r\n\r\n      chateau that night. Further, the ladder might have been placed there to\r\n\r\n      facilitate Larsan\u2019s flight in case of absolute necessity.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the third evidence puzzled me altogether. Having placed Larsan at the\r\n\r\n      end of the \u2018off-turning gallery,\u2019 I could not explain how he had taken\r\n\r\n      advantage of the moment when I had gone to the left wing of the chateau to\r\n\r\n      find Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques, to return to Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s room. It was a very dangerous thing to do. He risked being\r\n\r\n      captured,\u2014and he knew it. And he was very nearly captured. He had\r\n\r\n      not had time to regain his post, as he had certainly hoped to do. He had\r\n\r\n      then a very strong reason for returning to his room. As for myself, when I\r\n\r\n      sent Daddy Jacques to the end of the \u2018right gallery,\u2019 I naturally thought\r\n\r\n      that Larsan was still at his post. Daddy Jacques, in going to his post,\r\n\r\n      had not looked, when he passed, to see whether Larsan was at his post or\r\n\r\n      not.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat, then, was the urgent reason which had compelled Larsan to go to the\r\n\r\n      room a second time? I guessed it to be some evidence of his presence\r\n\r\n      there. He had left something very important in that room. What was it? And\r\n\r\n      had he recovered it? I begged Madame Bernier who was accustomed to clean\r\n\r\n      the room to look, and she found a pair of eye-glasses\u2014this pair,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur President!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      And Rouletabille drew the eye-glasses, of which we know, from his pocket.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I saw these eye-glasses,\u201d he continued, \u201cI was utterly nonplussed. I\r\n\r\n      had never seen Larsan wear eye-glasses. What did they mean? Suddenly I\r\n\r\n      exclaimed to myself: \u2018I wonder if he is long-sighted?\u2019 I had never seen\r\n\r\n      Larsan write. He might, then, be long-sighted. They would certainly know\r\n\r\n      at the Surete, and also know if the glasses were his. Such evidence would\r\n\r\n      be damning. That explained Larsan\u2019s return. I know now that Larsan, or\r\n\r\n      Ballmeyer, is long-sighted and that these glasses belonged to him.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI now made one mistake. I was not satisfied with the evidence I had\r\n\r\n      obtained. I wished to see the man\u2019s face. Had I refrained from this, the\r\n\r\n      second terrible attack would not have occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut,\u201d asked the President, \u201cwhy should Larsan go to Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson\u2019s room, at all? Why should he twice attempt to murder her?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBecause he loves her, Monsieur President.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is certainly a reason, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is the only reason. He was madly in love, and because of that, and\u2014other\r\n\r\n      things, he was capable of committing any crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid Mademoiselle Stangerson know this?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, Monsieur; but she was ignorant of the fact that the man who was\r\n\r\n      pursuing her was Frederic Larsan, otherwise, of course, he would not have\r\n\r\n      been allowed to be at the chateau. I noticed, when he was in her room\r\n\r\n      after the incident in the gallery, that he kept himself in the shadow, and\r\n\r\n      that he kept his head bent down. He was looking for the lost eye-glasses.\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson knew Larsan under another name.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMonsieur Darzac,\u201d asked the President, \u201cdid Mademoiselle Stangerson in\r\n\r\n      any way confide in you on this matter? How is it that she has never spoken\r\n\r\n      about it to anyone? If you are innocent, she would have wished to spare\r\n\r\n      you the pain of being accused.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson told me nothing,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDoes what this young man says appear probable to you?\u201d the President\r\n\r\n      asked.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson has told me nothing,\u201d he replied stolidly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you explain that, on the night of the murder of the keeper,\u201d the\r\n\r\n      President asked, turning to Rouletabille, \u201cthe murderer brought back the\r\n\r\n      papers stolen from Monsieur Stangerson?\u2014How do you explain how the\r\n\r\n      murderer gained entrance into Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s locked room?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe last question is easily answered. A man like Larsan, or Ballmeyer,\r\n\r\n      could have had made duplicate keys. As to the documents, I think Larsan\r\n\r\n      had not intended to steal them, at first. Closely watching Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      with the purpose of preventing her marriage with Monsieur Robert Darzac,\r\n\r\n      he one day followed her and Monsieur into the Grands Magasins de la\r\n\r\n      Louvre. There he got possession of the reticule which she lost, or left\r\n\r\n      behind. In that reticule was a key with a brass head. He did not know\r\n\r\n      there was any value attached to the key till the advertisement in the\r\n\r\n      newspapers revealed it. He then wrote to Mademoiselle, as the\r\n\r\n      advertisement requested. No doubt he asked for a meeting, making known to\r\n\r\n      her that he was also the person who had for some time pursued her with his\r\n\r\n      love. He received no answer. He went to the Post Office and ascertained\r\n\r\n      that his letter was no longer there. He had already taken complete stock\r\n\r\n      of Monsieur Darzac, and, having decided to go to any lengths to gain\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had planned that, whatever might happen,\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac, his hated rival, should be the man to be suspected.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI do not think that Larsan had as yet thought of murdering Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson; but whatever he might do, he made sure that Monsieur Darzac\r\n\r\n      should suffer for it. He was very nearly of the same height as Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Darzac and had almost the same sized feet. It would not be difficult, to\r\n\r\n      take an impression of Monsieur Darzac\u2019s footprints, and have similar boots\r\n\r\n      made for himself. Such tricks were mere child\u2019s play for Larsan, or\r\n\r\n      Ballmeyer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cReceiving no reply to his letter, he determined, since Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson would not come to him, that he would go to her. His plan had\r\n\r\n      long been formed. He had made himself master of the plans of the chateau\r\n\r\n      and the pavilion. So that, one afternoon, while Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson were out for a walk, and while Daddy Jacques was away, he\r\n\r\n      entered the latter by the vestibule window. He was alone, and, being in no\r\n\r\n      hurry, he began examining the furniture. One of the pieces, resembling a\r\n\r\n      safe, had a very small keyhole. That interested him! He had with him the\r\n\r\n      little key with the brass head, and, associating one with the other, he\r\n\r\n      tried the key in the lock. The door opened. He saw nothing but papers.\r\n\r\n      They must be very valuable to have been put away in a safe, and the key to\r\n\r\n      which to be of so much importance. Perhaps a thought of blackmail occurred\r\n\r\n      to him as a useful possibility in helping him in his designs on\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson. He quickly made a parcel of the papers and took\r\n\r\n      it to the lavatory in the vestibule. Between the time of his first\r\n\r\n      examination of the pavilion and the night of the murder of the keeper,\r\n\r\n      Larsan had had time to find out what those papers contained. He could do\r\n\r\n      nothing with them, and they were rather compromising. That night he took\r\n\r\n      them back to the chateau. Perhaps he hoped that, by returning the papers\r\n\r\n      he might obtain some gratitude from Mademoiselle Stangerson. But whatever\r\n\r\n      may have been his reasons, he took the papers back and so rid himself of\r\n\r\n      an encumbrance.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille coughed. It was evident to me that he was embarrassed. He had\r\n\r\n      arrived at a point where he had to keep back his knowledge of Larsan\u2019s\r\n\r\n      true motive. The explanation he had given had evidently been\r\n\r\n      unsatisfactory. Rouletabille was quick enough to note the bad impression\r\n\r\n      he had made, for, turning to the President, he said: \u201cAnd now we come to\r\n\r\n      the explanation of the Mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      A movement of chairs in the court with a rustling of dresses and an\r\n\r\n      energetic whispering of \u201cHush!\u201d showed the curiosity that had been\r\n\r\n      aroused.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt seems to me,\u201d said the President, \u201cthat the Mystery of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room, Monsieur Rouletabille, is wholly explained by your hypothesis.\r\n\r\n      Frederic Larsan is the explanation. We have merely to substitute him for\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac. Evidently the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d was open at\r\n\r\n      the time Monsieur Stangerson was alone, and that he allowed the man who\r\n\r\n      was coming out of his daughter\u2019s chamber to pass without arresting him\u2014perhaps\r\n\r\n      at her entreaty to avoid all scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, Monsieur President,\u201d protested the young man. \u201cYou forget that,\r\n\r\n      stunned by the attack made on her, Mademoiselle Stangerson was not in a\r\n\r\n      condition to have made such an appeal. Nor could she have locked and\r\n\r\n      bolted herself in her room. You must also remember that Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson has sworn that the door was not open.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, however, is the only way in which it can be explained. The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room was as closely shut as an iron safe. To use your own expression, it\r\n\r\n      was impossible for the murderer to make his escape either naturally or\r\n\r\n      supernaturally. When the room was broken into he was not there! He must,\r\n\r\n      therefore, have escaped.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat does not follow.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere was no need for him to escape\u2014if he was not there!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot there!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cEvidently, not. He could not have been there, if he were not found\r\n\r\n      there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut, what about the evidences of his presence?\u201d asked the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, Monsieur President, is where we have taken hold of the wrong end.\r\n\r\n      From the time Mademoiselle Stangerson shut herself in the room to the time\r\n\r\n      her door was burst open, it was impossible for the murderer to escape. He\r\n\r\n      was not found because he was not there during that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut the evidences?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey have led us astray. In reasoning on this mystery we must not take\r\n\r\n      them to mean what they apparently mean. Why do we conclude the murderer\r\n\r\n      was there?\u2014Because he left his tracks in the room? Good! But may he\r\n\r\n      not have been there before the room was locked. Nay, he must have been\r\n\r\n      there before! Let us look into the matter of these traces and see if they\r\n\r\n      do not point to my conclusion.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAfter the publication of the article in the \u2018Matin\u2019 and my conversation\r\n\r\n      with the examining magistrate on the journey from Paris to Epinaysur-Orge,\r\n\r\n      I was certain that \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d had been hermetically sealed, so to\r\n\r\n      speak, and that consequently the murderer had escaped before Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had gone into her chamber at midnight.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt the time I was much puzzled. Mademoiselle Stangerson could not have\r\n\r\n      been her own murderer, since the evidences pointed to some other person.\r\n\r\n      The assassin, then, had come before. If that were so, how was it that\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle had been attacked after? or rather, that she appeared to have\r\n\r\n      been attacked after? It was necessary for me to reconstruct the occurrence\r\n\r\n      and make of it two phases\u2014each separated from the other, in time, by\r\n\r\n      the space of several hours. One phase in which Mademoiselle Stangerson had\r\n\r\n      really been attacked\u2014the other phase in which those who heard her\r\n\r\n      cries thought she was being attacked. I had not then examined The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room. What were the marks on Mademoiselle Stangerson? There were marks of\r\n\r\n      strangulation and the wound from a hard blow on the temple. The marks of\r\n\r\n      strangulation did not interest me much; they might have been made before,\r\n\r\n      and Mademoiselle Stangerson could have concealed them by a collarette, or\r\n\r\n      any similar article of apparel. I had to suppose this the moment I was\r\n\r\n      compelled to reconstruct the occurrence by two phases. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had, no doubt, her own reasons for so doing, since she had told\r\n\r\n      her father nothing of it, and had made it understood to the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate that the attack had taken place in the night, during the second\r\n\r\n      phase. She was forced to say that, otherwise her father would have\r\n\r\n      questioned her as to her reason for having said nothing about it.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut I could not explain the blow on the temple. I understood it even less\r\n\r\n      when I learned that the mutton-bone had been found in her room. She could\r\n\r\n      not hide the fact that she had been struck on the head, and yet that wound\r\n\r\n      appeared evidently to have been inflicted during the first phase, since it\r\n\r\n      required the presence of the murderer! I thought Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n      had hidden the wound by arranging her hair in bands on her forehead.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs to the mark of the hand on the wall, that had evidently been made\r\n\r\n      during the first phase\u2014when the murderer was really there. All the\r\n\r\n      traces of his presence had naturally been left during the first phase; the\r\n\r\n      mutton-bone, the black footprints, the Basque cap, the handkerchief, the\r\n\r\n      blood on the wall, on the door, and on the floor. If those traces were\r\n\r\n      still all there, they showed that Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014who\r\n\r\n      desired that nothing should be known\u2014had not yet had time to clear\r\n\r\n      them away. This led me to the conclusion that the two phases had taken\r\n\r\n      place one shortly after the other. She had not had the opportunity, after\r\n\r\n      leaving her room and going back to the laboratory to her father, to get\r\n\r\n      back again to her room and put it in order. Her father was all the time\r\n\r\n      with her, working. So that after the first phase she did not re-enter her\r\n\r\n      chamber till midnight. Daddy Jacques was there at ten o\u2019clock, as he was\r\n\r\n      every night; but he went in merely to close the blinds and light the\r\n\r\n      night-light. Owing to her disturbed state of mind she had forgotten that\r\n\r\n      Daddy Jacques would go into her room and had begged him not to trouble\r\n\r\n      himself. All this was set forth in the article in the \u2018Matin.\u2019 Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques did go, however, and, in the dim light of the room, saw nothing.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMademoiselle Stangerson must have lived some anxious moments while Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques was absent; but I think she was not aware that so many evidences\r\n\r\n      had been left. After she had been attacked she had only time to hide the\r\n\r\n      traces of the man\u2019s fingers on her neck and to hurry to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n      Had she known of the bone, the cap, and the handkerchief, she would have\r\n\r\n      made away with them after she had gone back to her chamber at midnight.\r\n\r\n      She did not see them, and undressed by the uncertain glimmer of the night\r\n\r\n      light. She went to bed, worn-out by anxiety and fear\u2014a fear that had\r\n\r\n      made her remain in the laboratory as late as possible.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy reasoning had thus brought me to the second phase of the tragedy, when\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson was alone in the room. I had now to explain the\r\n\r\n      revolver shots fired during the second phase. Cries of \u2018Help!\u2014Murder!\u2019\r\n\r\n      had been heard. How to explain these? As to the cries, I was in no\r\n\r\n      difficulty; since she was alone in her room these could result from\r\n\r\n      nightmare only. My explanation of the struggle and noise that were heard\r\n\r\n      is simply that in her nightmare she was haunted by the terrible experience\r\n\r\n      she had passed through in the afternoon. In her dream she sees the\r\n\r\n      murderer about to spring upon her and she cries, \u2018Help! Murder!\u2019 Her hand\r\n\r\n      wildly seeks the revolver she had placed within her reach on the\r\n\r\n      night-table by the side of her bed, but her hand, striking the table,\r\n\r\n      overturns it, and the revolver, falling to the floor, discharges itself,\r\n\r\n      the bullet lodging in the ceiling. I knew from the first that the bullet\r\n\r\n      in the ceiling must have resulted from an accident. Its very position\r\n\r\n      suggested an accident to my mind, and so fell in with my theory of a\r\n\r\n      nightmare. I no longer doubted that the attack had taken place before\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle had retired for the night. After wakening from her frightful\r\n\r\n      dream and crying aloud for help, she had fainted.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy theory, based on the evidence of the shots that were heard at\r\n\r\n      midnight, demanded two shots\u2014one which wounded the murderer at the\r\n\r\n      time of his attack, and one fired at the time of the nightmare. The\r\n\r\n      evidence given by the Berniers before the examining magistrate was to the\r\n\r\n      effect that only one shot had been heard. Monsieur Stangerson testified to\r\n\r\n      hearing a dull sound first followed by a sharp ringing sound. The dull\r\n\r\n      sound I explained by the falling of the marble-topped table; the ringing\r\n\r\n      sound was the shot from the revolver. I was now convinced I was right. The\r\n\r\n      shot that had wounded the hand of the murderer and had caused it to bleed\r\n\r\n      so that he left the bloody imprint on the wall was fired by Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      in self-defence, before the second phase, when she had been really\r\n\r\n      attacked. The shot in the ceiling which the Berniers heard was the\r\n\r\n      accidental shot during the nightmare.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI had now to explain the wound on the temple. It was not severe enough to\r\n\r\n      have been made by means of the mutton-bone, and Mademoiselle had not\r\n\r\n      attempted to hide it. It must have been made during the second phase. It\r\n\r\n      was to find this out that I went to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d, and I obtained my\r\n\r\n      answer there.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille drew a piece of white folded paper from his pocket, and drew\r\n\r\n      out of it an almost invisible object which he held between his thumb and\r\n\r\n      forefinger.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis, Monsieur President,\u201d he said, \u201cis a hair\u2014a blond hair stained\r\n\r\n      with blood;\u2014it is a hair from the head of Mademoiselle Stangerson. I\r\n\r\n      found it sticking to one of the corners of the overturned table. The\r\n\r\n      corner of the table was itself stained with blood\u2014a tiny stain\u2014hardly\r\n\r\n      visible; but it told me that, on rising from her bed, Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had fallen heavily and had struck her head on the corner of its\r\n\r\n      marble top.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI still had to learn, in addition to the name of the assassin, which I\r\n\r\n      did later, the time of the original attack. I learned this from the\r\n\r\n      examination of Mademoiselle Stangerson and her father, though the answers\r\n\r\n      given by the former were well calculated to deceive the examining\r\n\r\n      magistrate\u2014Mademoiselle Stangerson had stated very minutely how she\r\n\r\n      had spent the whole of her time that day. We established the fact that the\r\n\r\n      murderer had introduced himself into the pavilion between five and six\r\n\r\n      o\u2019clock. At a quarter past six the professor and his daughter had resumed\r\n\r\n      their work. At five the professor had been with his daughter, and since\r\n\r\n      the attack took place in the professor\u2019s absence from his daughter, I had\r\n\r\n      to find out just when he left her. The professor had stated that at the\r\n\r\n      time when he and his daughter were about to re-enter the laboratory he was\r\n\r\n      met by the keeper and held in conversation about the cutting of some wood\r\n\r\n      and the poachers. Mademoiselle Stangerson was not with him then since the\r\n\r\n      professor said: \u2018I left the keeper and rejoined my daughter who was at\r\n\r\n      work in the laboratory.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was during that short interval of time that the tragedy took place.\r\n\r\n      That is certain. In my mind\u2019s eye I saw Mademoiselle Stangerson re-enter\r\n\r\n      the pavilion, go to her room to take off her hat, and find herself faced\r\n\r\n      by the murderer. He had been in the pavilion for some time waiting for\r\n\r\n      her. He had arranged to pass the whole night there. He had taken off Daddy\r\n\r\n      Jacques\u2019s boots; he had removed the papers from the cabinet; and had then\r\n\r\n      slipped under the bed. Finding the time long, he had risen, gone again\r\n\r\n      into the laboratory, then into the vestibule, looked into the garden, and\r\n\r\n      had seen, coming towards the pavilion, Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014alone.\r\n\r\n      He would never have dared to attack her at that hour, if he had not found\r\n\r\n      her alone. His mind was made up. He would be more at ease alone with\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson in the pavilion, than he would have been in the\r\n\r\n      middle of the night, with Daddy Jacques sleeping in the attic. So he shut\r\n\r\n      the vestibule window. That explains why neither Monsieur Stangerson, nor\r\n\r\n      the keeper, who were at some distance from the pavilion, had heard the\r\n\r\n      revolver shot.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen he went back to \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. Mademoiselle Stangerson came in.\r\n\r\n      What passed must have taken place very quickly. Mademoiselle tried to call\r\n\r\n      for help; but the man had seized her by the throat. Her hand had sought\r\n\r\n      and grasped the revolver which she had been keeping in the drawer of her\r\n\r\n      night-table, since she had come to fear the threats of her pursuer. The\r\n\r\n      murderer was about to strike her on the head with the mutton-bone\u2014a\r\n\r\n      terrible weapon in the hands of a Larsan or Ballmeyer; but she fired in\r\n\r\n      time, and the shot wounded the hand that held the weapon. The bone fell to\r\n\r\n      the floor covered with the blood of the murderer, who staggered, clutched\r\n\r\n      at the wall for support\u2014imprinting on it the red marks\u2014and,\r\n\r\n      fearing another bullet, fled.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe saw him pass through the laboratory, and listened. He was long at the\r\n\r\n      window. At length he jumped from it. She flew to it and shut it. The\r\n\r\n      danger past, all her thoughts were of her father. Had he either seen or\r\n\r\n      heard? At any cost to herself she must keep this from him. Thus when\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson returned, he found the door of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d closed,\r\n\r\n      and his daughter in the laboratory, bending over her desk, at work!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Turning towards Monsieur Darzac, Rouletabille cried: \u201cYou know the truth!\r\n\r\n      Tell us, then, if that is not how things happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d replied Monsieur Darzac.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI admire you for your silence,\u201d said Rouletabille, \u201cbut if Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson knew of your danger, she would release you from your oath. She\r\n\r\n      would beg of you to tell all she has confided to you. She would be here to\r\n\r\n      defend you!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac made no movement, nor uttered a word. He looked at\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille sadly.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHowever,\u201d said the young reporter, \u201csince Mademoiselle is not here, I\r\n\r\n      must do it myself. But, believe me, Monsieur Darzac, the only means to\r\n\r\n      save Mademoiselle Stangerson and restore her to her reason, is to secure\r\n\r\n      your acquittal.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is this secret motive that compels Mademoiselle Stangerson to hide\r\n\r\n      her knowledge from her father?\u201d asked the President.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat, Monsieur, I do not know,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cIt is no business of\r\n\r\n      mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President, turning to Monsieur Darzac, endeavoured to induce him to\r\n\r\n      tell what he knew.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you still refuse, Monsieur, to tell us how you employeed your time\r\n\r\n      during the attempts on the life of Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI cannot tell you anything, Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President turned to Rouletabille as if appealing for an explanation.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe must assume, Monsieur President, that Monsieur Robert Darzac\u2019s\r\n\r\n      absences are closely connected with Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s secret, and\r\n\r\n      that Monsieur Darzac feels himself in honour bound to remain silent. It\r\n\r\n      may be that Larsan, who, since his three attempts, has had everything in\r\n\r\n      training to cast suspicion on Monsieur Darzac, had fixed on just those\r\n\r\n      occasions for a meeting with Monsieur Darzac at a spot most compromising.\r\n\r\n      Larsan is cunning enough to have done that.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      The President seemed partly convinced, but still curious, he asked:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut what is this secret of Mademoiselle Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat I cannot tell you,\u201d said Rouletabille. \u201cI think, however, you know\r\n\r\n      enough now to acquit Monsieur Robert Darzac! Unless Larsan should return,\r\n\r\n      and I don\u2019t think he will,\u201d he added, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOne question more,\u201d said the President. \u201cAdmitting your explanation, we\r\n\r\n      know that Larsan wished to turn suspicion on Monsieur Robert Darzac, but\r\n\r\n      why should he throw suspicion on Daddy Jacques also?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere came in the professional detective, Monsieur, who proves himself an\r\n\r\n      unraveller of mysteries, by annihilating the very proofs he had\r\n\r\n      accumulated. He\u2019s a very cunning man, and a similar trick had often\r\n\r\n      enabled him to turn suspicion from himself. He proved the innocence of one\r\n\r\n      before accusing the other. You can easily believe, Monsieur, that so\r\n\r\n      complicated a scheme as this must have been long and carefully thought out\r\n\r\n      in advance by Larsan. I can tell you that he had long been engaged on its\r\n\r\n      elaboration. If you care to learn how he had gathered information, you\r\n\r\n      will find that he had, on one occasion, disguised himself as the\r\n\r\n      commissionaire between the \u2018Laboratory of the Surete\u2019 and Monsieur\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, of whom \u2018experiments\u2019 were demanded. In this way he had been\r\n\r\n      able before the crime, on two occasions to take stock of the pavilion. He\r\n\r\n      had \u2018made up\u2019 so that Daddy Jacques had not recognised him. And yet Larsan\r\n\r\n      had found the opportunity to rob the old man of a pair of old boots and a\r\n\r\n      cast-off Basque cap, which the servant had tied up in a handkerchief, with\r\n\r\n      the intention of carrying them to a friend, a charcoal-burner on the road\r\n\r\n      to Epinay. When the crime was discovered, Daddy Jacques had immediately\r\n\r\n      recognised these objects as his. They were extremely compromising, which\r\n\r\n      explains his distress at the time when we spoke to him about them. Larsan\r\n\r\n      confessed it all to me. He is an artist at the game. He did a similar\r\n\r\n      thing in the affair of the \u2018Credit Universel,\u2019 and in that of the \u2018Gold\r\n\r\n      Ingots of the Mint.\u2019 Both these cases should be revised. Since Ballmeyer\r\n\r\n      or Larsan has been in the Surete a number of innocent persons have been\r\n\r\n      sent to prison.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXVIII. In Which It Is Proved That One Does Not Always Think of\r\n\r\n      Everything\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Great excitement prevailed when Rouletabille had finished. The court-room\r\n\r\n      became agitated with the murmurings of suppressed applause. Maitre Henri\r\n\r\n      Robert called for an adjournment of the trial and was supported in his\r\n\r\n      motion by the public prosecutor himself. The case was adjourned. The next\r\n\r\n      day Monsieur Robert Darzac was released on bail, while Daddy Jacques\r\n\r\n      received the immediate benefit of a \u201cno cause for action.\u201d Search was\r\n\r\n      everywhere made for Frederic Larsan, but in vain. Monsieur Darzac finally\r\n\r\n      escaped the awful calamity which, at one time, had threatened him. After a\r\n\r\n      visit to Mademoiselle Stangerson, he was led to hope that she might, by\r\n\r\n      careful nursing, one day recover her reason.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille, naturally, became the \u201cman of the hour.\u201d On leaving the\r\n\r\n      Palais de Justice, the crowd bore him aloft in triumph. The press of the\r\n\r\n      whole world published his exploits and his photograph. He, who had\r\n\r\n      interviewed so many illustrious personages, had himself become illustrious\r\n\r\n      and was interviewed in his turn. I am glad to say that the enormous\r\n\r\n      success in no way turned his head.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      We left Versailles together, after having dined at \u201cThe Dog That Smokes.\u201d\r\n\r\n       In the train I put a number of questions to him which, during our meal,\r\n\r\n      had been on the tip of my tongue, but which I had refrained from uttering,\r\n\r\n      knowing he did not like to talk \u201cshop\u201d while eating.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy friend,\u201d I said, \u201cthat Larsan case is wonderful. It is worthy of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He begged me to say no more, and humorously pretended an anxiety for me\r\n\r\n      should I give way to silly praise of him because of a personal admiration\r\n\r\n      for his ability.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll come to the point, then,\u201d I said, not a little nettled. \u201cI am still\r\n\r\n      in the dark as to your reason for going to America. When you left the\r\n\r\n      Glandier you had found out, if I rightly understand, all about Frederic\r\n\r\n      Larsan; you had discovered the exact way he had attempted the murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite so. And you,\u201d he said, turning the conversation, \u201cdid you suspect\r\n\r\n      nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNothing!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt\u2019s incredible!\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t see how I could have suspected anything. You took great pains to\r\n\r\n      conceal your thoughts from me. Had you already suspected Larsan when you\r\n\r\n      sent for me to bring the revolvers?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes! I had come to that conclusion through the incident of the\r\n\r\n      \u2018inexplicable gallery.\u2019 Larsan\u2019s return to Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2019s room,\r\n\r\n      however, had not then been cleared up by the eye-glasses. My suspicions\r\n\r\n      were the outcome of my reasoning only; and the idea of Larsan being the\r\n\r\n      murderer seemed so extraordinary that I resolved to wait for actual\r\n\r\n      evidence before venturing to act. Nevertheless, the suspicion worried me,\r\n\r\n      and I sometimes spoke to the detective in a way that ought to have opened\r\n\r\n      your eyes. I spoke disparagingly of his methods. But until I found the\r\n\r\n      eye-glasses I could but look upon my suspicion of him in the light of an\r\n\r\n      absurd hypothesis only. You can imagine my elation after I had explained\r\n\r\n      Larsan\u2019s movements. I remember well rushing into my room like a mad-man\r\n\r\n      and crying to you: \u2018I\u2019ll get the better of the great Fred. I\u2019ll get the\r\n\r\n      better of him in a way that will make a sensation!\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was then thinking of Larsan, the murderer. It was that same evening\r\n\r\n      that Darzac begged me to watch over Mademoiselle Stangerson. I made no\r\n\r\n      efforts until after we had dined with Larsan, until ten o\u2019clock. He was\r\n\r\n      right there before me, and I could afford to wait. You ought to have\r\n\r\n      suspected, because when we were talking of the murderer\u2019s arrival, I said\r\n\r\n      to you: \u2018I am quite sure Larsan will be here to-night.\u2019\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut one important point escaped us both. It was one which ought to have\r\n\r\n      opened our eyes to Larsan. Do you remember the bamboo cane? I was\r\n\r\n      surprised to find Larsan had made no use of that evidence against Robert\r\n\r\n      Darzac. Had it not been purchased by a man whose description tallied\r\n\r\n      exactly with that of Darzac? Well, just before I saw him off at the train,\r\n\r\n      after the recess during the trial, I asked him why he hadn\u2019t used the cane\r\n\r\n      evidence. He told me he had never had any intention of doing so; that our\r\n\r\n      discovery of it in the little inn at Epinay had much embarrassed him. If\r\n\r\n      you will remember, he told us then that the cane had been given him in\r\n\r\n      London. Why did we not immediately say to ourselves: \u2018Fred is lying. He\r\n\r\n      could not have had this cane in London. He was not in London. He bought it\r\n\r\n      in Paris\u2019? Then you found out, on inquiry at Cassette\u2019s, that the cane had\r\n\r\n      been bought by a person dressed very like Robert Darzac, though, as we\r\n\r\n      learned later, from Darzac himself, it was not he who had made the\r\n\r\n      purchase. Couple this with the fact we already knew, from the letter at\r\n\r\n      the poste restante, that there was actually a man in Paris who was passing\r\n\r\n      as Robert Darzac, why did we not immediately fix on Fred himself?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf course, his position at the Surete was against us; but when we saw the\r\n\r\n      evident eagerness on his part to find convicting evidence against Darzac,\r\n\r\n      nay, even the passion he displayed in his pursuit of the man, the lie\r\n\r\n      about the cane should have had a new meaning for us. If you ask why Larsan\r\n\r\n      bought the cane, if he had no intention of manufacturing evidence against\r\n\r\n      Darzac by means of it, the answer is quite simple. He had been wounded in\r\n\r\n      the hand by Mademoiselle Stangerson, so that the cane was useful to enable\r\n\r\n      him to close his hand in carrying it. You remember I noticed that he\r\n\r\n      always carried it?\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAll these details came back to my mind when I had once fixed on Larsan as\r\n\r\n      the criminal. But they were too late then to be of any use to me. On the\r\n\r\n      evening when he pretended to be drugged I looked at his hand and saw a\r\n\r\n      thin silk bandage covering the signs of a slight healing wound. Had we\r\n\r\n      taken a quicker initiative at the time Larsan told us that lie about the\r\n\r\n      cane, I am certain he would have gone off, to avoid suspicion. All the\r\n\r\n      same, we worried Larsan or Ballmeyer without our knowing it.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cif Larsan had no intention of using the cane as\r\n\r\n      evidence against Darzac, why had he made himself up to look like the man\r\n\r\n      when he went in to buy it?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe had not specially \u2018made up\u2019 as Darzac to buy the cane; he had come\r\n\r\n      straight to Cassette\u2019s immediately after he had attacked Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. His wound was troubling him and, as he was passing along the\r\n\r\n      Avenue de l\u2019Opera, the idea of the cane came to his mind and he acted on\r\n\r\n      it. It was then eight o\u2019clock. And I, who had hit upon the very hour of\r\n\r\n      the occurrence of the tragedy, almost convinced that Darzac was not the\r\n\r\n      criminal, and knowing of the cane, I still never suspected Larsan. There\r\n\r\n      are times...\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are times,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen the greatest intellects\u2014...\u201d\r\n\r\n       Rouletabille shut my mouth. I still continued to chide him, but, finding\r\n\r\n      he did not reply, I saw he was no longer paying any attention to what I\r\n\r\n      was saying. I found he was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER XXIX. The Mystery of Mademoiselle Stangerson\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      During the days that followed I had several opportunities to question him\r\n\r\n      as to his reason for his voyage to America, but I obtained no more precise\r\n\r\n      answers than he had given me on the evening of the adjournment of the\r\n\r\n      trial, when we were on the train for Paris. One day, however, on my still\r\n\r\n      pressing him, he said:\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cCan\u2019t you understand that I had to know Larsan\u2019s true personality?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt,\u201d I said, \u201cbut why did you go to America to find that out?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      He sat smoking his pipe, and made no further reply. I began to see that I\r\n\r\n      was touching on the secret that concerned Mademoiselle Stangerson.\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille evidently had found it necessary to go to America to find out\r\n\r\n      what the mysterious tie was that bound her to Larsan by so strange and\r\n\r\n      terrible a bond. In America he had learned who Larsan was and had obtained\r\n\r\n      information which closed his mouth. He had been to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And now, what was this mystery which held Mademoiselle Stangerson and\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Robert Darzac in so inexplicable a silence? After so many years\r\n\r\n      and the publicity given the case by a curious and shameless press; now\r\n\r\n      that Monsieur Stangerson knows all and has forgiven all, all may be told.\r\n\r\n      In every phase of this remarkable story Mademoiselle Stangerson had always\r\n\r\n      been the sufferer.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The beginning dates from the time when, as a young girl, she was living\r\n\r\n      with her father in Philadelphia. A visitor at the house, a Frenchman, had\r\n\r\n      succeeded by his wit, grace and persistent attention, in gaining her\r\n\r\n      affections. He was said to be rich and had asked her of her father.\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Stangerson, on making inquiries as to Monsieur Jean Roussel,\r\n\r\n      found that the man was a swindler and an adventurer. Jean Roussel was but\r\n\r\n      another of the many names under which the notorious Ballmeyer, a fugitive\r\n\r\n      from France, tried to hide himself. Monsieur Stangerson did not know of\r\n\r\n      his identity with Ballmeyer; he learned that the man was simply\r\n\r\n      undesirable for his daughter. He not only refused to give his consent to\r\n\r\n      the marriage but denied him admission into the house. Mathilde Stangerson,\r\n\r\n      however, had fallen in love. To her Jean Roussel was everything that her\r\n\r\n      love painted him. She was indignant at her father\u2019s attitude, and did not\r\n\r\n      conceal her feelings. Her father sent her to stay with an aunt in\r\n\r\n      Cincinnati. There she was joined by Jean Roussel and, in spite of the\r\n\r\n      reverence she felt for her father, ran away with him to get married.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      They went to Louisville and lived there for some time. One morning,\r\n\r\n      however, a knock came at the door of the house in which they were and the\r\n\r\n      police entered to arrest Jean Roussel. It was then that Mathilde\r\n\r\n      Stangerson, or Roussel, learned that her husband was no other than the\r\n\r\n      notorious Ballmeyer!\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The young woman in her despair tried to commit suicide. She failed in\r\n\r\n      this, and was forced to rejoin her aunt in Cincinnati, The old lady was\r\n\r\n      overjoyed to see her again. She had been anxiously searching for her and\r\n\r\n      had not dared to tell Monsieur Stangerson of her disappearance. Mathilde\r\n\r\n      swore her to secrecy, so that her father should not know she had been\r\n\r\n      away. A month later, Mademoiselle Stangerson returned to her father,\r\n\r\n      repentant, her heart dead within her, hoping only one thing: that she\r\n\r\n      would never again see her husband, the horrible Ballmeyer. A report was\r\n\r\n      spread, a few weeks later, that he was dead, and she now determined to\r\n\r\n      atone for her disobedience by a life of labour and devotion for her\r\n\r\n      father. And she kept her word.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      All this she had confessed to Robert Darzac, and, believing Ballmeyer\r\n\r\n      dead, had given herself to the joy of a union with him. But fate had\r\n\r\n      resuscitated Jean Roussel\u2014the Ballmeyer of her youth. He had taken\r\n\r\n      steps to let her know that he would never allow her to marry Darzac\u2014that\r\n\r\n      he still loved her.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson never for one moment hesitated to confide in\r\n\r\n      Monsieur Darzac. She showed him the letter in which Jean Roussel asked her\r\n\r\n      to recall the first hours of their union in their beautiful and charming\r\n\r\n      Louisville home. \u201cThe presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the\r\n\r\n      garden its brightness,\u201d he had written. The scoundrel pretended to be rich\r\n\r\n      and claimed the right of taking her back to Louisville. She had told\r\n\r\n      Darzac that if her father should know of her dishonour, she would kill\r\n\r\n      herself. Monsieur Darzac had sworn to silence her persecutor, even if he\r\n\r\n      had to kill him. He was outwitted and would have succumbed had it not been\r\n\r\n      for the genius of Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson was herself helpless in the hands of such a\r\n\r\n      villain. She had tried to kill him when he had first threatened and then\r\n\r\n      attacked her in \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d. She had, unfortunately, failed, and felt\r\n\r\n      herself condemned to be for ever at the mercy of this unscrupulous wretch\r\n\r\n      who was continually demanding her presence at clandestine interviews. When\r\n\r\n      he sent her the letter through the Post Office, asking her to meet him,\r\n\r\n      she had refused. The result of her refusal was the tragedy of The Yellow\r\n\r\n      Room. The second time he wrote asking for a meeting, the letter reaching\r\n\r\n      her in her sick chamber, she had avoided him by sleeping with her\r\n\r\n      servants. In that letter the scoundrel had warned her that, since she was\r\n\r\n      too ill to come to him, he would come to her, and that he would be in her\r\n\r\n      chamber at a particular hour on a particular night. Knowing that she had\r\n\r\n      everything to fear from Ballmeyer, she had left her chamber on that night.\r\n\r\n      It was then that the incident of the \u201cinexplicable gallery\u201d occurred.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The third time she had determined to keep the appointment. He asked for it\r\n\r\n      in the letter he had written in her own room, on the night of the incident\r\n\r\n      in the gallery, which he left on her desk. In that letter he threatened to\r\n\r\n      burn her father\u2019s papers if she did not meet him. It was to rescue these\r\n\r\n      papers that she made up her mind to see him. She did not for one moment\r\n\r\n      doubt that the wretch would carry out his threat if she persisted in\r\n\r\n      avoiding him, and in that case the labours of her father\u2019s lifetime would\r\n\r\n      be for ever lost. Since the meeting was thus inevitable, she resolved to\r\n\r\n      see her husband and appeal to his better nature. It was for this interview\r\n\r\n      that she had prepared herself on the night the keeper was killed. They did\r\n\r\n      meet, and what passed between them may be imagined. He insisted that she\r\n\r\n      renounce Darzac. She, on her part, affirmed her love for him. He stabbed\r\n\r\n      her in his anger, determined to convict Darzac of the crime. As Larsan he\r\n\r\n      could do it, and had so managed things that Darzac could never explain how\r\n\r\n      he had employeed the time of his absence from the chateau. Ballmeyer\u2019s\r\n\r\n      precautions were most cunningly taken.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Larsan had threatened Darzac as he had threatened Mathilde\u2014with the\r\n\r\n      same weapon, and the same threats. He wrote Darzac urgent letters,\r\n\r\n      declaring himself ready to deliver up the letters that had passed between\r\n\r\n      him and his wife, and to leave them for ever, if he would pay him his\r\n\r\n      price. He asked Darzac to meet him for the purpose of arranging the\r\n\r\n      matter, appointing the time when Larsan would be with Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson. When Darzac went to Epinay, expecting to find Ballmeyer or\r\n\r\n      Larsan there, he was met by an accomplice of Larsan\u2019s, and kept waiting\r\n\r\n      until such time as the \u201ccoincidence\u201d could be established.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      It was all done with Machiavellian cunning; but Ballmeyer had reckoned\r\n\r\n      without Joseph Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      Now that the Mystery of \u201cThe Yellow Room\u201d has been cleared up, this is not\r\n\r\n      the time to tell of Rouletabille\u2019s adventures in America. Knowing the\r\n\r\n      young reporter as we do, we can understand with what acumen he had traced,\r\n\r\n      step by step, the story of Mathilde Stangerson and Jean Roussel. At\r\n\r\n      Philadelphia he had quickly informed himself as to Arthur William Rance.\r\n\r\n      There he learned of Rance\u2019s act of devotion and the reward he thought\r\n\r\n      himself entitled to for it. A rumour of his marriage with Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had once found its way into the drawing-rooms of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n      He also learned of Rance\u2019s continued attentions to her and his\r\n\r\n      importunities for her hand. He had taken to drink, he had said, to drown\r\n\r\n      his grief at his unrequited love. It can now be understood why\r\n\r\n      Rouletabille had shown so marked a coolness of demeanour towards Rance\r\n\r\n      when they met in the witnesses\u2019 room, on the day of the trial.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      The strange Roussel-Stangerson mystery had now been laid bare. Who was\r\n\r\n      this Jean Roussel? Rouletabille had traced him from Philadelphia to\r\n\r\n      Cincinnati. In Cincinnati he became acquainted with the old aunt, and had\r\n\r\n      found means to open her mouth. The story of Ballmeyer\u2019s arrest threw the\r\n\r\n      right light on the whole story. He visited the \u201cpresbytery\u201d\u2014a small\r\n\r\n      and pretty dwelling in the old colonial style\u2014which had, indeed,\r\n\r\n      \u201clost nothing of its charm.\u201d Then, abandoning his pursuit of traces of\r\n\r\n      Mademoiselle Stangerson, he took up those of Ballmeyer. He followed them\r\n\r\n      from prison to prison, from crime to crime. Finally, as he was about\r\n\r\n      leaving for Europe, he learned in New York that Ballmeyer had, five years\r\n\r\n      before, embarked for France with some valuable papers belonging to a\r\n\r\n      merchant of New Orleans whom he had murdered.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And yet the whole of this mystery has not been revealed. Mademoiselle\r\n\r\n      Stangerson had a child, by her husband,\u2014a son. The infant was born\r\n\r\n      in the old aunt\u2019s house. No one knew of it, so well had the aunt managed\r\n\r\n      to conceal the event.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      What became of that son?\u2014That is another story which, so far, I am\r\n\r\n      not permitted to relate.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      About two months after these events, I came upon Rouletabille sitting on a\r\n\r\n      bench in the Palais de Justice, looking very depressed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, old man?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou are looking very downcast.\r\n\r\n      How are your friends getting on?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cApart from you,\u201d he said, \u201cI have no friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope that Monsieur Darzac\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd Mademoiselle Stangerson\u2014How is she?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cBetter\u2014much better.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen you ought not to be sad.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am sad,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I am thinking of the perfume of the lady in\r\n\r\n      black\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe perfume of the lady in black!\u2014I have heard you often refer to\r\n\r\n      it. Tell me why it troubles you.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps\u2014some day; some day,\u201d said Rouletabille.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n      And he heaved a profound sigh.
